                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
					the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
					significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
					documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
					and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
					positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
					the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>. The
					staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
					researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
					editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
					historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
					the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
					Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
					minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
					Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
					and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
					198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
					Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> be
					a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
					decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
					series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
					of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
					The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
					Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> is guided by the
					principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
					or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
					been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
					importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
					purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
						<hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> be published not more than
					30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
					meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
					editing.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations
						series</hi> that documents the most important issues in the foreign policy
					of the <pb n="IV" xml:id="pg_IV" facs="0004"/>last five years of the
					administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. The subseries presents in 34 print volumes
					a documentary record of the major foreign policy decisions and actions of
					President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s administration.</p>
                <p>This volume presents the documentary record of U.S. policy toward the Republic of
					Korea in three separate chronological chapters. The first and largest
					compilation traces the bilateral relations between the United States and the
					Republic of Korea from 1964 through 1968. The second compilation on the Pueblo
					crisis documents the crisis occasioned by North Korea's seizure of the U.S.S.
					Pueblo and its crew in early 1968 and the subsequent diplomatic efforts and
					tortuous negotiations with North Korea to win the crew's release by the end of
					the year. The final and smallest compilation documents successful U.S. efforts
					to encourage a settlement of issues between the Republic of Korea and Japan
					unresolved since World War II. The result was a treaty that normalized relations
					between the two principal Northeast Asian allies of the United States. This
					volume is part 1 of a larger volume that was to have included a compilation on
					U.S. bilateral relations with Japan. As explained in the section on
					declassification review below, part 2 of this volume will be published when and
					if key documentation on Japan is declassified.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
					Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>,
					the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
					documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
					editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
					detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>. Individual compiler-editors
					vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
					documentation. The editors also apply these selection criteria in accordance
					with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
					scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
					priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
					records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
					governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
					affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues and activities, including dissenting or
					alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted, undertaken on behalf of
					the United States by government officials and representatives in all agencies in
					the foreign affairs community;</p>
                <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
					the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign policy,
					including important information that attended Presidential decisions;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
					special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
					these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
					most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
					policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
					exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
					demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <p>7. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
					aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
					information in the formulation of major U.S. policies;</p>
                <p>8. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
					foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>9. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>10. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
					other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>11. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
					military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
					the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>12. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
					changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi> include all records needed to
					provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
					significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
					agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
					foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
					of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
					foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
					records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
					been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
					Records Administration. The declassification review and opening for public
					review of all Department of State records no later than 30 years after the
					events is mandated <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0006"/>by the Foreign
					Relations statute. The Department of State and other record sources used in the
					volume are described in detail in the section on Sources below.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign
					Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XXIX, Part 1</p>
                <p>Research and compilation of this volume was completed in 1997. The first section
					of the volume deals with U.S.-Republic of Korea relations during a period of
					strife and violence on the Korean peninsula unknown since the Korean War. The
					year 1964 was marked by an internal crisis within the Republic of Korea as
					students and opponents of the government of President Pak Chong-hui (<persName corresp="#p_PC1">Park Chung Hee</persName>) took to the streets in violent
					opposition to the government's alleged corruption and the potential treaty
					between the Republic of Korea and Japan. The government responded with the
					imposition of martial law. After the end of 1964, internal opposition lessened,
					but the threat from North Korea grew. In 1967, border clashes along the 38th
					parallel and infiltration of North Korean saboteurs increased. The culmination
					of this campaign occurred in January 1968 when North Korean commandos attacked
					the Blue House (the presidential residence in Seoul) in a brazen attempt to
					assassinate President Pak. A few days later North Korea seized the U.S.S. Pueblo
					and its crew. The United States was faced with South Korean demands for
					retaliatory action, and a serious crisis of confidence in Seoul. The volume
					documents how the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> administration
					responded, both in this first compilation and in the one on the Pueblo, to the
					strong possibility of renewed war on the Korean peninsula. The basic theme of
					the compilation is the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
					administration's de-escalation of the crisis. The final major theme of this
					first compilation is the close personal relationship between Presidents Pak and
						<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and how this resulted in
					South Korea's support for the war in Vietnam. What began as a token South Korean
					presence in Vietnam in 1964 grew under the unrelenting pressure of President
						<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to a commitment in 1968 of
					almost 45,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops to fight in South
					Vietnam. The process by which the United States convinced South Korea and
					compensated it for its support is fully documented.</p>
                <p>The second compilation, on the Pueblo crisis, begins with records of the almost
					daily meetings of President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> with
					his key military, intelligence, and diplomatic advisers to examine contingency
					options, none particularly good and some that were dangerous. After it became
					clear that a military response was unacceptable, the United States relied on a
					campaign of diplomacy, including using whatever influence the Soviet Union would
					bring to bear on North Korea, shows of U.S. force, and direct negotiations with
					North Korea at Panmunjom. The latter course proved the one that eventually
					succeeded. The Pueblo compilation traces the long, frustrating negotiation with
					North Korea <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>in enough detail to
					indicate its difficulty, but without subjecting the reader to the same tedium
					endured by the U.S. negotiators and policy makers.</p>
                <p>The final and smallest section of the volume documents U.S. efforts to convince
					both Japan and Korea to settle their outstanding differences and sign in June
					1965 and ratify that December a Treaty on Basic Relations. The compilation
					documents the high-level pressure brought by the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> administration on the two allies to resolve their long-
					standing differences. Underlying this effort was the assumption that without
					this normalization of Korean-Japanese relations, northeast Asia would not be
					secure and would not prosper.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
					the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
					conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
					rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
						Relations series</hi> follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
					guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
					is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
					which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
					according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
					the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
					for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
					punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
					typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
					source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
					type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
					are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
					the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
					each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
					unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
					declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
					declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
					text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
					have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
					pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
					omitted from a particular document because it was unrelated to the subject of
					the volume, however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the
					source text are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
					classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
					the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
					President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
					made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
					information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
					printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
					provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
					describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
					that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
					memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
					supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
					Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
					the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
					recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>.
					The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of
					the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of
					the series. Although the Advisory Committee does not attempt to review the
					contents of individual volumes in the series, it does monitor the overall
					process and makes recommendations on particular problems that come to its
					attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has not reviewed part 1 of this volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
					Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
					review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
					accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified
					National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12958, specific information may be exempt from automatic
					declassification after 25 years if its release could be expected to:</p>
                <p>1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal information
					about the application of an intelligence source or method, or reveal the
					identity of a human intelligence source when the unauthorized disclosure of that
					source would clearly and demonstrably damage the national security interests of
					the United States;</p>
                <p>2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of
					mass destruction;</p>
                <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>
                <p>3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or
					activities;</p>
                <p>4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art
					technology within the U.S. weapons system;</p>
                <p>5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;</p>
                <p>6) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations
					between the United States and a foreign government, or seriously and
					demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the current
					ability of U.S. Government officials to protect the President, Vice President,
					and other officials for whom protection services, in the interest of national
					security, are authorized;</p>
                <p>8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair current
					national security emergency preparedness plans; or</p>
                <p>9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
					subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
					and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
					appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
					concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
					governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The editors believe the volume presented here is a thorough, accurate, and
					reliable record of major U.S. foreign policy decisions and significant
					diplomatic activity toward Korea. The most substantive declassification problem
					arose not among documents selected for publication on Korea, but for those
					selected for Japan. It was the unanimous view of the Advisory Committee, the
					Historian of the Department of State, and the editors that given the number and
					significance of documents selected for publication in the Japan compilation that
					must still remain classified, the Japan part of the volume did not constitute a
					“thorough and accurate, and reliable documentary record of major United States
					foreign policy decisions,” the standard set by Public Law 102–138 of October 28,
					1991 (22 USC 4351, et seq.). Part 2 of this volume on Japan will not be printed
					until it meets these standards. The Historian and the Advisory Committee will
					continue to seek declassification of the documents withheld.</p>
                <p>The declassification review of part 1 of this volume, which was completed in
					1999, resulted in decisions to withhold from publication 2.2 percent of the
					documentation selected. Nine documents were denied in full. One of these is <ref target="#d26">Document 26</ref>, but a number of related documents with
					similar information are printed. <ref target="#d113">Documents 113</ref>, <ref target="#d121">121</ref>, <ref target="#d131">131</ref>, <ref target="#d163">163</ref>, <ref target="#d170">170</ref>, <ref target="#d249">249</ref>,
					and <ref target="#d359">359</ref> concern limited and varied intelligence
					matters and actions whose deletions do not appreciably affect the volume.
					Although <pb n="X" xml:id="pg_X" facs="0010"/>these covert actions and
					relationships existed, none was of such importance that it had a major effect on
					U.S. policy toward the Republic of Korea. <ref target="#d203">Document 203</ref>
					contains material with formerly restricted data, and its release is prohibited
					by law. Most of the 2.2 percent withheld is accounted for by these deletions,
					although there are additional minor excisions in other documents.</p>

					Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
					conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
					by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
					the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; the files of

					the National Archives and Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park,
					Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized office (or lot) files covering

					and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
					preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
					foreign affairs-related documentation from other federal agencies, including the
					National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of
					Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians also have access to records of the Department of
					Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
					Secretaries of Defense and their major assistants.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians
					to high-level intelligence documents from those records in the custody of that
					Agency and at the Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and
					facilitated by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
					Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.
					Department of State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue
					to work out the procedural and scholarly aspects of identifying the key portions
					of the intelligence record.</p>
                <p>Intelligence-related material in this volume comes primarily from the unretired
					historical files of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (<gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL), retired <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> lot files, and from the records of the National Security
					Agency, especially the Center for Cryptologic History's files and the CCS
					Archives Pueblo collection.</p>
                <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the audiotapes of President
						<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations,
					which are in the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library. Most of
					the tapes on Korea relate to the Pueblo crisis, and those that were printed or
					cited in the footnotes were used to augment the written records of President
						<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and his advisers meeting on
					the Pueblo.</p>
                <p>Some general observations can be made about the specific sources that proved
					especially useful for each compilation in this volume. For the compilations on
						U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> bilateral relations and the
					Korean-Japan relations, the Department of State Central Files were the most
					important single source, followed by the records of the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library. Because of the strong
					Department of Defense interest in Korea, the records of the Secretary of Defense
					(various <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> files) and the records of the
					Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs (various
						OASD/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> files) were important sources for
					all three sections of the volume. The first part of the Pueblo crisis
					compilation draws heavily upon the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library meeting notes files. The records of the National
					Security Agency provided valuable context for the compilation.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
					preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
					Archives of these records is in process. Many of the records are already
					available for public review at the National Archives. The declassification
					review of other records is going forward in accordance with the provisions of
					Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old, except file
					series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the President, should be
					reviewed for declassification by 2002.</p>

								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces level and
							withdrawing part of US forces, but have impression both are under active
							consideration with possibility of decision at any time.<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">An undated State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> study of U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force reductions had been completed and an undated
								draft memorandum for the President had been prepared. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">U. Alexis Johnson</persName> submitted a copy

								(Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s Appointment
								Book contains no reference to the meeting, and no further record of
								that meeting has been found.</note> If this so, and since this item
							will be on agenda of Secretary's meeting with President Pak,<note n="3" xml:id="d1fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was in Tokyo January
								24–28 to attend the meeting of the Joint U.S.-Japan Committee on
								Trade and Economic Affairs. Before returning to Washington,
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stopped in Korea and
								met with Pak on January 29.</note> I offer my latest thinking on
							this subject.</p>
                        <p>2. We are forcing or trying persuade <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Govt to make number of difficult decisions during first half this year:
							A tough economic stabilization program alongside reduced US aid; a
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement; and
							devaluation. Within Korea price inflation of past year has produced
							under threat of strikes, demands for higher wages for civil servants and
							employees of govt enterprises and restlessness among junior military
							officers and NCOs with families. Govt will have to raise salaries and
							pay soon, but increases will fall short of price rise. To add to these
							difficulties price of rice is now beginning move upward (from 2,750 to
							3,100 won per bag within last week) which is both earlier and higher
							than normal seasonal pattern, and we expect further rises before barley
							crop is harvested in June. Spring months are always lean food months and
							time of greatest economic difficulty and restiveness in country.</p>
                        <p>3. New govt is just getting under way. There is no doubt that it is
							preparing to take some of tough decisions required of it, i.e. economic
							stabilization, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement, and
							devaluation. Opposition tactics are to maintain continuous barrage of
							irresponsible criticism in order capitalize on govt's difficulties and
							public restlessness in effort bring govt down. Our effort it seems to me
							should be to encourage govt to act courageously and constructively in
							these next few months and, insofar as possible, to help it by US
							statements and actions.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0034"/>
                        <p>4. In these circumstances, I think it would be prudent in next few months
							to avoid any announcement of reduction in US forces and to avoid loading
							on govt requirement to reduce <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							forces. This does not mean we should not take decisions, but timing of
							any announcements and consultation with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> on force reductions should be decided in light of
							complex of factors described above. I would hope that our actions on
							these two matters could be deferred until the second half of <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1964.</p>
                        <p>5. Simultaneous announcement that both <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US forces will be reduced would come as severe
							jolt, with psychological and political repercussions that could
							jeopardize stability of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.
							Accordingly, if both are to be reduced, the sequence should be for
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to be reduced first and
							after public has adjusted to this shock, to deal with any US force
							reduction.</p>
                        <p>6. Ideally reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US forces
							should be accompanied by sound plan for restructuring and repositioning
							of two forces in order maintain or improve defense capability. In my 2
							1/2 years here I have heard repeatedly from our military that too large
							a proportion of both US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
							and reserves are in forward areas and that main lateral line of supply
							through Inchon and main supply depot at Ascom are dangerously vulnerable
							in event of attack. Furthermore US installations are far too numerous
							and too dispersed for military effectiveness or for economical
							administration. I am told what is needed and what has long been
							advocated is a repositioning of the forces, a consolidation of
							installations, and a speeding up of program now under way to develop our
							supply depots in south. The argument is invariably advanced that
							repositioning installations would be costly, but this ignores fact that
							our troops are presently installed in antiquated structures, some dating
							back to 1953. Many of these are falling apart and annual maintenance and
							replacement cost already running in millions annually and will go higher
							as obsolescence rate increases. I do not see economic, let alone
							military, wisdom of putting millions of dollars every year into existing
							installations which have inherent weaknesses described above. Therefore
							would hope that any <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US forces
							reduction will not be done by axe method of simply chopping off numbers
							and reshuffling rest into existing installations but would be part of a
							considered reorganization for improved defense of Korea.</p>
                        <p>7. Am aware that achieving reductions through a coordinated plan
							involving restructuring and repositioning might take time to work out in
							face of pressures to effect economies quickly. Nonetheless, urge that
							Washington take time to work out both US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reductions in coordinated way that will meet all
							requirements: military, economic and political.</p>

								agreed that “some action on force levels in Korea “ should be taken,
								that U.S. and Korean forces should not be reduced simultaneously,
								and that Korean forces should be reduced before U.S. forces were
								cut. (Memorandum for the record, February 5; National Defense
								University, Taylor Papers, Chairman's Staff Group, Box 25)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>They met yesterday and reportedly agreed that rather than cut both <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US forces we should cut neither
							now! <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> does favor both a
							70,000 man cut in the 580,000 man <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							army (phased over two years) and a 12,000 man cut in US forces by the
							end of 1964. This is a big step forward from the military's previous
							adamant position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was perfectly willing to buy
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> cut; State feels that such a
							small reduction probably would have little adverse political
							implication. But Rusk is strongly opposed to a simultaneous US cut,
							announced now. He fears it would upset the Japs and Koreans, and even
							worry all our Asian allies that we're disengaging from Asia.</p>
                        <p>So <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then said that if we
							didn't cut US forces he didn't want to cut <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces either; this would be hard to defend on the Hill
							because it ran counter to our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> theory
							of buying cheap infantry (i.e. why cut local forces instead of bringing
							our boys home?).</p>
                        <p>It would be a pity to postpone entirely once again a long-needed shift
							which would also save some money. There is never a good time to cut, but
							the plain fact of the matter—no longer denied by anyone—is that we're
							overinsured militarily in Korea at a time when we need strength much
							more elsewhere. The big danger area is in Southeast Asia not Northeast
							Asia, and has been ever since the Korean War.</p>
                        <p>Since the issue seems to be more one of timing than of substance, why
							can't we take a decision in principle now, while allowing ourselves
							tactical flexibility in execution? We ought to be able to devise some
							way of fuzzing up our action enough to forestall the adverse reactions
							State fears. For example, we could:</p>
                        <p>1. Decide now to go ahead with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							cut, but play it in low key so as to avoid the problem bothering
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> could tell the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0036"/> when in Seoul that we desire a
							gradual streamlining of their forces, but feel that they and we should
							handle it in such a way as to minimize any political splash. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have as much incentive as we to avoid
							publicity. And a cut of only 35,000 per year out of 560,000 could be
							presented here if necessary as revamping, not a main cut.</p>
                        <p>2. Decide now within the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, at least
							tentatively, on a substantial cut in US forces by the end of 1965, if
							not 1964. Planning should begin, but no announcement of any kind would
							be made until State and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> present a
							final plan to you for decision by 30 June 1964.</p>
                        <p>3. State and Defense should work out together the optimum timing for such
							a cut, with an eye to mitigating any adverse political impact in the
							area. Perhaps doing it in several bites over an 18-month period would
							help. We could also begin to lay the public relations groundwork by
							pointing out the erosion of Chicom military capabilities as a result of
							the Sino-Soviet split, and how we're over-insured in Northeast Asia so
							may need some redeployment to increase the forces available for
							Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>While any force cuts will always entail some pain, and I don't wish to
							play down State's concerns, we cannot always let this be an excuse for
							no action at all. So I urge you keep the pressure on State and Defense
							via some such proposal as that described above.</p>

                        <p>1. Submitted as an enclosure to this airgram is the text of an
							Aide-Mémoire handed by the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs to the
							Counselor for Political Affairs on January 30, the day following the
							visit to Seoul for the Secretary of State. Prior to the Secretary's
							arrival, there had been frequent mention in the press of a memorandum,
							setting forth the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government's
							position on problems of mutual US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							interest, which was to be presented to the Secretary during his visit.
							No such presentation took place and it is presumed that the Aide-Mémoire
							is the document in question. Why the Korean officials did not go through
							with their original plan to present the paper while the Secretary was in
							Seoul is not known at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. The Aide-Mémoire covers four main subjects: (a) The Level of Military
							Forces; (b) <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan Talks for the
							Normalization of Diplomatic Relations; (c) Economic Stabilization and
							Development Plan; and (d) Status of Forces Agreement, these being at the
							present time the four principal areas of concern of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government in its relations with the
							United States. All except the fourth were raised with the Secretary by
							President Pak Chong-hui.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Pak also discussed
								the implications of France's recognition of Communist China as well
								as threats posed to the Far East by Communist China. (Ibid.)</note>
							Although not discussed, the Status of Forces Agreement negotiations were
							recognized by the President and the Secretary to be a subject of major
							interest and, accordingly, were mentioned prominently in the Joint
							Communiqué issued following their conversation.<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">The joint communiqué is printed in American Foreign
								Policy: Current Documents, 1964, pp.
								920–921.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. It should be noted that while, with one exception noted below, all of
							the points made by the President in his discussion with the Secretary
							are contained in the Aide-Mémoire, there are a number of items in the
							Aide-Mémoire which the President did not take up with the Secretary. It
							is not known whether the omissions, listed below, were the result of a
							conscious decision by Pak to concentrate only on the points which he did
							mention, either for emphasis or because of the shortness of time
							available, or whether they were inadvertent.</p>
                        <p>4. On the subject of military force levels, Pak spoke exclusively about
							the necessity for retaining present levels. He did not refer to the
							questions of improvement of the equipment of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces, maintenance of local procurement by the
							U.S. armed forces at last year's level, or the supply of P.L. 480
							products to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces, which
							are discussed in subparagraphs (b), (c), and (d), respectively of
							paragraph 5, Section I of the Aide-Mémoire.</p>
                        <p>5. With regard to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
							normalization issue, Pak did not mention to the Secretary the proposal
							to speed up the payment of the <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0038"/>property claims settlement, the question of the legal status of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> residents of Japan, or the dispute over
							Tok-to (Takeshima Island), discussed in subparagraphs (b), (e), and (f),
							respectively of paragraph 3, Section II. While omission of the latter
							two subjects appears appropriate in view of the limited time available
							for the conversation, it is surprising that the President did not refer
							to his Government's desire for U.S. intervention with the Japanese to
							obtain speedier payment of the property claims settlement, particularly
							since the Minister of Foreign Affairs had specifically told the
							Ambassador a few days prior to the visit that this would be one of the
							requests which Pak would make to the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>6. In discussing the general topic of economic stabilization and U.S.
							aid, Pak did not make the references to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Five Year Plans contained in the Aide-Mémoire, nor did
							he cover the points concerning fertilizer imports [Section III, para.
								3(b)],<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">All brackets in the source
								text.</note> maintenance of the present exchange rate [3(c)], and
							offshore procurement [3(d)]. In discussing the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer program, Pak suggested suspension for two or
							three years instead of the 5 years recommended in the Aide-Mémoire
							[3(e)]. He did ask for the creation by the U.S. Government of favorable
							conditions for Korean imports but did not refer specifically to the
							problem of textile quotas [3(f)].</p>
                        <p>7. It was during his discussion of this general topic that Pak deviated
							from the subjects covered in the Aide-Mémoire by asking for an
							additional 20 million to 30 million dollars of aid in order to check the
							price spiral (para 28, refair).<note n="6" xml:id="d3fn6">Airgram A–540
								makes no mention of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
								response to Pak's request, except to note that <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> complimented Pak on his
								“courage to bite the bullet and take steps needed to get the Korean
								economy moving “ and mentioned several alternative methods available
								to promote economic development in Korea.</note> The degree of
							seriousness with which the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> regards
							this request is as yet undetermined, but it can be presumed that we will
							be faced with further references to the need for additional economic
							assistance including supporting assistance throughout the year.</p>
                        <p>8. Some of the topics included in the Aide-Mémoire were also discussed at
							the separate conferences attended by Secretary of Commerce Hodges,
							Secretary of Labor Wirtz and other members of the party. The substance
							of these conferences is being reported separately.<note n="7" xml:id="d3fn7">Memoranda of those conversations are in the National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Conference Files: Lot 66
								D 110, Chronology of International Conferences Abroad,
								1961–1964.</note> A study of the gist of these conferences, Pak's
							conversation with the Secretary, and the Aide-Mémoire should afford a
							comprehensive view <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0039"/>of the stance
							currently being taken by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> with
							regard to its relations with the United States Government.</p>

                        <p rend="center">AIDE-MEMOIRE</p>
                        <p>On the occasion of the visit to Korea of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>, Secretary of State of the United States of
							America, the Government of the Republic of Korea wishes to present its
							views and position on the following problems of mutual interest to the
							Governments of the Republic of Korea and the United States.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. The Level of Military Forces</p>
                        <p>1. The North Korean regime has recently reinforced its combat resources
							by not only activating a new Army Corps but also expanding arsenals,
							ammunition and military vehicle manufacturing factories. On the other
							hand, the Communist regime has been maintaining close ties with
							bellicose Communist China and is constantly preparing for its renewal of
							an invasion against the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>2. The existing armistice agreement has merely been a military measure
							for temporary cease-fire and the flagrant violation of the armistice
							committed by the Communists along the demarcation line is causing
							serious uneasiness in Korea.</p>
                        <p>3. In view of the present situation in South East Asia, particularly
							military instability in Laos and fruitless anti-guerrilla warfare in
							South Viet-Nam, the presence of the U.S. armed forces and the
							maintenance of powerful <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
							forces are essential for checking further Communist expansion in this
							part of the free world.</p>
                        <p>4. Although there has been a partial withdrawal of the U.S. armed forces
							in Europe particularly from West Germany, the security of Europe will
							not be affected owing to the presence of the effective North Atlantic
							Treaty Organization. However, since there is no such collective security
							organization so firmly established as <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the Far East, the existing <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0040"/>Korea-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty alone would not be
							sufficient enough to relieve the feeling of uneasiness from the Korean
							people.</p>
                        <p>5. As the new Government has just been established in Korea, it requires
							considerable time to lay down solid democratic foundation in political,
							economic and social fields.</p>
                        <p>Taking into account the above mentioned internal and external situations
							confronting Korea, the following are presented for favorable
							consideration by the U.S. Government:</p>
                        <p>a. The strength of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces
							and the U.S. armed forces in Korea should continuously be kept at
							present level. The reduction of the military forces might be considered
							only after having examined both internal and external situations in the
							future.</p>
                        <p>b. The improvement of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
							equipments should be implemented promptly. The incident of January 14,
							1964, in which an F–86 jet was shot down by the North Koreans, clearly
							indicates that the Communist forces in the North have superior
							weapons.</p>
                        <p>c. The military procurement by the U.S. armed forces in Korea should not
							be reduced from the level of last year, as any reduction in the amount
							of the U.S. military procurement is bound to have a direct and profound
							effect upon the stability of Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>d. In order to alleviate the hardship suffered by the men in uniform due
							to the low salary allowance, it is desired that the U.S. Government
							would continue to supply U.S. surplus agricultural products to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
							Talks for the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations</p>
                        <p>1. As the United States and other free nations desire, the Korean
							Government firmly stands by its basic policy to realize an early
							normalization of diplomatic relations between Korean and Japan from a
							broader scope of view-point that it would be of significant benefit to
							Korea and Japan as well as to the general free world interests.</p>
                        <p>2. However, the Korea-Japan normalization question has recently become a
							serious domestic political issue in Korea due to the national sentiment,
							derived from the past relations of the two countries, and the negative
							attitude from certain segments of the opposition parties. Primary
							reasons and commonplace belief attributable to such attitude of the
							opposition may be given as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. They believe that the Korean fishing industry has been greatly
							handicapped by the Japanese monopoly of the fishery and their
							indiscriminate catch in the past, the consequences of which have
							resulted in curtailing the yearly per capita income of the Korean
							fishermen to mere 27 U.S. dollars at present. Under such circumstances,
							the Korean fishermen have naturally come to entertain a deep-rooted fear
							against the Japanese fishing industry. They also fear that any
							concession on the <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>Peace Line would
							lead the Japanese fishery, overwhelmingly superior in number of fishing
							vessels, scale, equipment and technique, to indulge in random fishing
							activities, the result of which would undoubtedly bring about exhaustion
							of fishery resources and eventual ruin of the Korean fishery.</p>
                        <p>b. It is also feared that the Japanese economic cooperation which is to
							follow the normalization of the relations between the two countries may
							result in a reduction of the United States assistance to Korea.</p>
                        <p>c. They feel with resentment that the Korean Government is engaging in a
							low-postured diplomacy toward Japan at the expense of excessive
							concessions in an attempt to tide over the present economic crisis
							arising from inflation and shortage of foreign exchange in Korea.</p>
                        <p>It is feared that any venture to settle the matter under such unfavorable
							circumstances may bring about a crisis of the present Government. The
							Korean Government, however, is firmly resolved to settle the problem
							with grave determination.</p>
                        <p>3. It is, therefore, earnestly requested that the United States would
							render its utmost cooperation in support of the position of the Korean
							Government in the following lines:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Attitude of Japanese Government</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that the Japanese Government fully realize the difficulties
							confronted by the Korean Government and show sincerity in seeking an
							early normalization of the relations between the two countries.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. Property Claims Payment</p>
                        <p>It is desired that the property claims payment which is to<note n="9" xml:id="d3fn9">be made over a period of 10 years. [Footnote in the
								source text.]</note> be made in a shorter period and a larger
							portion of payment be made during initial period. In this connection,
							the good offices of the United States Government is solicited to urge
							the Japanese Government to consider favorably the request of the Korean
							Government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">c. United States Aid to Korea</p>
                        <p>The Koreans fear that an influx of the Japanese capital into Korea may
							result in what may be called “an economic invasion “ by Japan. In order
							to mitigate such sentiment entertained by the Korean public, it is
							desired that the United States would maintain present level of economic
							aid to Korea and encourage its positive investment in Korea.<note n="10" xml:id="d3fn10">

                        <p>d. Fishery and Peace Line Question</p>
                        <p>The following are the basic principles of the Korean Government for the
							settlement of the fishery question.</p>
                        <p>(1) It is deemed absolutely necessary to establish appropriate fishing
							regulatory measures for the purpose of preserving fishery resources in
							the waters adjacent to Korea. Only under this premise, Japan would be
							allowed to maintain status quo of their fishing activities on the basis
							of its past catch in the waters within the Peace Line.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Korean fishermen should not be made victims of the pressure of
							the Japanese fishing activities, leading to an eventual ruin of the
							Korean fishery.</p>
                        <p>(3) Extreme gap between the fishery capabilities of the two countries
							being the primary deterrent to the settlement of the fishery and the
							Peace Line question, it is desirable that Japan offer assistance to
							Korea as fishery cooperation at least in the amount of over 100 million
							dollars to improve Korean fishery capability. In this connection, it is
							earnestly hoped that the United States would advise the Japanese

                        <p>The Korean Government maintains that the question of legal status of the

							historical background that has led to their presence in Japan and they
							should be given a special legal status and more favorable treatments
							than those accorded to ordinary aliens in Japan.<note n="11" xml:id="d3fn11">In 1964 approximately 600,000 Koreans, brought to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Economic Stabilization &amp; Development
							Plan </p>
                        <p>1. It is the prevailing view of the Korean Government that the first five
							year economic development plan has achieved considerable progress.
							Especially, the economic development plan has contributed a great deal
							to the development of key industries and manufacturing fields as well as
							in the expansion of import-saving industry and the increase of export
							productions. At the same time, the Government notes that in the course
							of planning and implementation there have been many setbacks resulted
							from a series of unexpected changes in the economic climate and high
							growth rate of population. However, the Korean Government is firmly
							determined to carry out the current five year economic development plan
							through supplementary adjustments and reasonable modifications.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Government is contemplating a more practical and
							effective second year economic development plan which would be based
							upon the achievements and experiences gained through the implementation
							of the preceding one.</p>
                        <p>2. One of the most urgent tasks confronting with this Government is to
							stabilize price levels and to overcome the extremely unfavorable balance
							of international payment.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to cope with such a situation, the Korean Government, in
							consultation with the United States Operation Mission, had established a
							financial stabilization program in the fiscal year 1963, and exerted
							utmost efforts to maintain and strengthen those measures. As in the case
							of last year, the Government has set up another stabilization program
							for the fiscal year 1964 and will effectively implement the program in
							cooperation with the United States Operation Mission.</p>
                        <p>However, with respect to the international balance of payment, it is
							noted with regret that this country, in spite of all the efforts being
							made, still has to go a long way to reverse the current unfavorable
							trend.</p>
                        <p>From the beginning of the fiscal year 1962, the United States economic
							aids have been steadily kept on the downward trend. The heavy cuts in
							the aids have come not only in the field of Supporting Assistance but
							also in such indirect fields as Military Assistance Program Transfer,
							off-shore procurement of United Nations forces and restrictive quota
							system on certain Korean products for export to the United States of
							America.</p>
                        <p>These reductions simultaneously effected in the aids have inevitably
							brought tremendous and unbearable pressures upon all the segments of the
							Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>Above all, the Korean Government wishes to remind the United States that
							the Republic of Korea, being at the forefront of anti-Communist
							struggle, has constantly to be on the alert and to maintain a strong <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>military, economic and political
							posture to cope with ever-increasing menace in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, the Korean Government, in the light of general economic
							situation set forth in the above, would like to take this opportunity to
							urge the Government of the United States to take into immediate and
							favorable consideration the following requests:</p>
                        <p>a. The Supporting Assistance should be maintained at 1963 level at least
							for five years hereafter.</p>
                        <p>b. The fertilizer import through Supporting Assistance and grain import
							under PL–480 program should be expedited so as to meet the seasonal
							demands.</p>
                        <p>c. The dollar-won exchange rate should be maintained at the present level
							to prevent any possible impacts that may effect upon price levels such
							as inflationary trend and psychological chain reaction.</p>
                        <p>d. The proper measures should be taken to ensure the present level of the
							U.S. offshore procurement program.</p>
                        <p>e. The initiation of overall Military Assistance Program Transfer should
							be suspended for five years, as it would create heavy burden on the
							Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>f. The overall trade and commercial policy toward Korea should be
							re-examined in more favorable terms and the restriction imposed on the
							quota for the Korean textile goods should be relaxed.</p>
                        <p>g. The Supporting Assistance funds should be timely released in the
							future as was the case of recent release of 15 million dollars of
							Supporting Assistance fund which has greatly relieved the economic
							difficulties in Korea.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Status of Forces Agreement </p>
                        <p>1. It is recalled that prior to the resumption in September 1962 of the
							current negotiations for an agreement covering the status of the United
							States armed forces in Korea, the Republic of Korea and the United
							States announced that the conclusion of the agreement would await the
							restoration of civil government.</p>
                        <p>2. It need not reiterate the sincere desire of the Korean peoples for an
							early conclusion of such an agreement in order to seek reasonable and
							equitable solution of many problems arising from the stationing of the
							troops in Korea. It is also to be noted that the Korean populace has
							shown, particularly after the civil government was restored in Korea, an
							increased concern over the progress of the present negotiations. The
							Korean Government, therefore, would like to urge the United States
							Government to render its fullest cooperation possible so as to arrive at
							the conclusion of the said agreement at an earliest possible date.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0045"/>
                        <p>3. In particular, the Korean Government desires to complete discussions,
							as soon as practicable, on all the important articles including the
							subject of criminal jurisdiction, the draft of which has not yet been
							tabled. The Korean Government further requests that, with regard to a
							pending issue of compensation to the owners of private facilities and
							areas used by the United States armed forces, the Government of the
							United States, taking into account current financial difficulties of the
							Korean Government, would bear the compensation with sympathetic
							understanding.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In the airgram under reference, the Embassy analyzed the present
							situation within the Republic of Korea, appraised the outlook for the
							near future, and suggested certain courses of action to be taken by U.S.
							Government agencies. Those suggestions were not presented in a
							systematic framework of specific policy objectives. In this message
							there is set forth in rough order of priority the objectives toward
							which the Embassy believes U.S. policies and actions in Korea should be
							directed in calendar year 1964.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Progress Toward Internal Stability </p>
                        <p>1. In the political field, our efforts should be concentrated on
							facilitating the successful functioning of constitutional government and
							democratic institutions which have now been re-established in the wake
							of military government. While discouraging the government, if <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0046"/>necessary, from resorting to
							authoritarian methods, we should on the other hand make every possible
							effort to influence the opposition to act in responsible fashion. At the
							same time we should seek to avoid giving the impression that the United
							States is interfering in the internal political affairs of Korea.</p>
                        <p>2. In the economic sphere, the primary goal for 1964 should be the
							pursuit of sound monetary and fiscal policies and the stabilization of
							price levels. The exchange rate will have to be adjusted to a realistic
							level some time not later than mid-summer 1964.</p>

                        <p>3. It goes without saying that every effort should be made to encourage
							Korea and Japan to achieve a settlement this year.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion of a Status of Forces Agreement </p>
                        <p>4. Full agreement can be reached this year and the pace of negotiations
							on this agreement should be accelerated. Agreement will remove a
							vexatious and potentially harmful issue from US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>5. The Embassy and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> hope that
							progress can be made during 1964 in persuading the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government to make more efficient use
							of the resources available to it. We should continue pressing for an
							increase in exports and for adoption of a more restrictive import
							policy. We should also continue stressing the need for expansion of
							agricultural production and seek greater participation in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic development by other
							governments and international agencies.</p>
                        <p>With respect to economic aid policy, U.S. assistance programs should
							continue to be linked to Korean implementation of agreed stabilization
							goals. The cumulative load of economic adjustments which the ROK economy
							is being called upon to bear in 1964 and after should be gauged so as
							not to impose a drag on progress or force a further serious
							deterioration of the foreign exchange position. We will also need to
							take into account the ability of the government to bear such adjustments
							politically in a given period. This will necessitate in the course of
							the year politico-economic judgements affecting the emphasis and timing
							of U.S. actions involving among other things the level of support
							assistance, the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer program,
							and the level of PL 480 support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Force Levels</p>
                        <p>6. The decision has been made that the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed force levels should remain unchanged during 1964.
							Another review of the military, economic and political factors involved
							in force level reduction should be conducted toward the end of 1964 to

							light of that review.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Consolidation of the ROKG International Position </p>

                        <p>In early March 1964 former Korean Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KH1">Kim Hyon-chol</persName> informed Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> that the Republic of
							Korea might be willing to provide 3 or 4,000 troops to assist the United

							nevertheless, once informed of it by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>, Foreign Minister
								<persName>Chong Il</persName>-kwon appeared to support Korean
							participation in the war and suggested ways in which prohibitions
							hindering Korean troops from serving abroad could be overcome. The
							Ambassador cautioned that the ramifications of such an action must be

                        <p>In the following weeks contacts between Korea and South Vietnam
							increased. <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName>, head
							of the Democratic Republican Party, traveled to Saigon in mid-March, and
							in early April a special Vietnamese military mission came to Korea to
							examine Korean military training and its governmental transformation
							from military to civilian rule. The Vietnamese diplomatic presence in
							Korea increased with additional embassy personnel. (Telegrams 1180,
							March 19, and 1276, April 9, both from Seoul; both ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In circular telegram 2043, May 1, the Department of State informed U.S.
							Ambassadors of President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s “conviction
							that it is important for more nations of the Free World to ‘show their
							flags’ in Viet Nam “ in order to create a unified stand against
							communism in Southeast Asia. Accordingly, the U.S. Government appealed
							to the Republic of Korea and other free world governments to contribute
							to the defeat of the Communist regime in North Vietnam by furnishing
							men, material, and other forms of support to the resources already
							devoted to that struggle by the United States. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET S) After being informed of the
							U.S. position the Korean Foreign Minister indicated he would seek
							Cabinet-level approval for supplying a field-hospital unit to Vietnam
							and raised the possibility of Korea also sending signal corps support as
							well. (Telegram 1436 from Seoul, May 8; ibid., DEF 19–2 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The
							Embassy in Saigon advised that it would welcome Korean “advisers and
							selected military personnel who would share in the really dangerous
							work” and suggested using some of them “for the type of work where our
							men are getting killed and wounded. “(Telegram 2162 from Saigon, May 9;
							ibid.) The Department of State concurred, notifying the Embassy in Seoul
							to “urge ROK contribution of special-forces advisors (in addition to
							field-hospital unit and signal-corps support earlier mentioned).”
							(Telegram 1030 to Seoul, May 12; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In June the United States and Korea agreed that the latter would send one
							field-hospital unit and 10 karate instructors to Vietnam as soon as the
							Korean Government received an official request from the Government of
							Vietnam. The Department of State instructed the Embassy in Seoul to urge
							the Korean Government “to assume as much of costs as possible” but noted
							that the United States was “prepared to underwrite whatever is needed to
							have <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> participate in Viet Nam in this
							fashion.” (Telegrams 2378 to Saigon and 1186 to Seoul, June 24, and
							telegram 5 from Seoul, July 2; all ibid., DEF 19 KOR S–VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Embassy in Seoul also reported that
							the Korean Government was “still interested in supplying combat troops,”
							and was apparently “at <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0049"/>a loss to
							understand” why the United States was not “soliciting direct military
							participation.” (Telegram 1748 from Seoul, June 30; ibid.) In reply the
							Department of State explained that combat forces had not been requested
							by Vietnam and that the inherent nature of guerrilla warfare made use of
							ground forces, particularly those from a third country, inappropriate
							and unsuitable. (Telegram 12 to Seoul, July 3; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On September 5 the United States and Korean Commands in Vietnam signed an
							agreement defining the terms and procedures applicable to Korean
							involvement in Vietnam. (Airgram A–455 from Saigon, December 14; ibid.)
							After those arrangements had been finalized, a Korean surgical-hospital

                        <p>Korean student riots, ostensibly against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Jap settlement but actually against <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, are getting worrisome. No one

							decision. Also Pak government be in danger and nothing as good in

                        <p>All in all, instead of urging Pak and his Rasputin, <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> to be more democratic,
							maybe we ought to tolerate a little more dictatorship in this messy

								State-<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>-Defense study which will
							enable me to weigh and resolve the choices facing us with respect to the
							possible redeployment<note n="2" xml:id="d9fn2">President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> instructed that the words
								“to Hawaii” be removed here and in paragraph 2 below so that
								redeployment proposals would not be restricted to that destination.
								(Memorandum to holders of NSAM No. 298 from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, May 11;
								ibid.)</note> of one of the U.S. Divisions now stationed in Korea.
							The study should explore what sequence of U.S. actions, involving
							economic assistance, military assistance, diplomatic communications, and
							public statements, would minimize the negative effects and maximize the
							benefit of such a redeployment, taking into account</p>
                        <p>—Korea's military security</p>
                        <p>—Korea's short-term political stability</p>
                        <p>—the long-term U.S. objective of stimulating sustainable economic
							expansion and strengthening Korea's social and political
							institutions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Specific requirements follow:</p>
                        <p>1. In considering changes in the level and composition of U.S.
							assistance, the study should offer both a bare-bones minimum program and
							a more generous variant which would fully compensate the Korean
							Government for the loss of a U.S. Division. In connection with the
							latter, attention should be given to the internal economic and military
							measures by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> which we might
							bargain for—measures that might appreciably shorten the period of
							Korea's dependence on extraordinary economic assistance.</p>
                        <p>2. The study should assess the value of such a redeployment for the
							balance and flexibility of the U.S. military posture.</p>
                        <p>3. The study should contain estimates of the budgetary gains and
							costs.</p>

                        <p>4. As regards the U.S. balance of payments, the study should estimate
							both the gross gain of withdrawing a U.S. Division, and the net gain
							that will result, after account is taken of the recommended changes in
							U.S. assistance.</p>
                        <p>5. The study should include recommendations as to the steps we should
							take, in the event of a redeployment, (a) to avoid any misreading of our
							intentions in Japan, Southeast Asia, Europe—and in Russia and Communist
							China, and (b) to explain the good sense of the move to the Congress and
							the U.S. public.</p>
                        <p>6. As regards timing, I should like two alternatives to be explored: one
							with a decision date of June 1, 1964; the other with a decision date of
							December 1, 1964. With respect to each alternative, the study should
							elaborate a detailed plan of action, giving announcement dates and
							implementation dates for all major actions.</p>
                        <p>The study should be completed in time for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration on May 2<note n="3" xml:id="d9fn3">Accepting the views of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed in discussions with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> that the time was

								the United States in June and Pak's belief that Kim should not leave

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Toward end of my talk with President Pak May 13 after telling me that
								<persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> would not go
							to U.S. (reftel), he hesitated and then said he wished tell me something
							in utmost confidence.</p>
                        <p>2. He said he is going to remove KCP as chairman of <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> (govt party). Said I may wonder why he
							has not done so already. There were two reasons: First, he had received
							several letters from Ohno<note n="3" xml:id="d10fn3"> Bamboku Ohno was
								Vice President of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan and had met
								with Kim during the latter's trip to Tokyo in March. (Telegram 2785
								from Tokyo, March 25; ibid.)</note> warning him that if <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> removed there would be no settlement
							with Japan. Pak said he hoped settlement could be made in next month or
							two and some time thereafter <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> would
							be removed. Pak said if what he had in mind became known consequences
							would be “dangerous,” because <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> had
							his supporters and it could endanger talks with Japan. He asked me
							reveal this information to no one.</p>
                        <p>3. I gave him this commitment. Since Pak in making these remarks had
							spoken in tone of anger and emotion directed at <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>, I did not think it desirable for me to say anything on
							matter as personally sensitive as this one is and did not pursue matter
							further. Foregoing known here only to Doherty and <persName corresp="#p_HPC1">Habib</persName>. Request Dept hold this
							information tight.</p>
                        <p>4. Comment: I have refrained from reporting this until I had time to
							consider what this meant. I am inclined to accept this as honest
							statement of Pak's present attitude and intentions and possibly explains
							his vacillations when he was under heavy pressure to remove <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> in April.<note n="4" xml:id="d10fn4">Telegram 1374 from Seoul, April 28, detailed the opposition to Kim

							months. On May 18 PriMin told me he expects <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> will leave Korea in September for “six months” study
							abroad, adding that relations between Pak and <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> bitter.</p>
                        <p>5. Not only has Ohno's position added greatly to Pak's domestic
							difficulties, but whether Pak will or can remove <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> when time comes <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0056"/>remains to be seen. <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>'s plan is to
							stay on the scene and we expect that before long he may mount a campaign
							against his enemies and that they in turn will resume the attack on him.
							At present there is a lull in the fight, which Pak arranged by personal
							appeals to both sides.</p>

								his meeting with Pak. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Following are details of President's Pak's meeting with General
								<persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and me afternoon June
							3 (see <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>2. Pak said:</p>
                        <p>A. Govt has up to today been patient and lenient in treating with student
							demonstrations; student aim now is to bring govt down.</p>
                        <p>B. Today's demonstrations had turned into rioting with police stations
							destroyed, govt trucks and jeeps seized and a police armory broken into.
							Police had suffered many casualties. (During meeting report came in that
							a policeman had been killed by students.)</p>
                        <p>C. President of Seoul National University, main source of student
							activity, today sent message to President through Vice Speaker Na
							Yong-kyun (opposition) that he had info 65 students and a number of
							professors encouraging demonstrators were Communists. He had been afraid
							to pass this info but was doing so in view of today's rioting.</p>
                        <p>D. President had summoned PriMin, other Cabinet members concerned, Chiefs
							of Armed Services, and members National Security Council to special
							meeting this afternoon, which came to conclusion that martial law
							required. It would be imposed tonight, and he requested General
								<persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> to release 6th and
							28th divisions.</p>
                        <p>E. Martial law would be confined to Seoul initially, but might have to be
							extended to other areas depending on how situation developed. In that
							case more troops might be required.</p>
                        <p>3. In response my request for details of martial law, Pak said:</p>
                        <p>A. All schools down to primary would be closed at outset, and would be
							reopened gradually as situation permitted.</p>
                        <p>B. Manipulators of students would be investigated and indicted by
							prosecutor general.</p>
                        <p>C. Press censorship would be established.</p>
                        <p>D. Civil cases would be tried by civil courts. More important cases by
							military courts.</p>
                        <p>E. General Min Ki-sik would be martial law commander.</p>
                        <p>F. He could not say how long martial law would be kept on. He hoped not
							too long.</p>
                        <p>4. I said National Assembly now in adjournment, but could be convened by
							members. Assembly would want to debate martial law <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0059"/>decision. In view divisions in Assembly
							govt action might face heavy criticism in Assembly adding confusion to
							situation. Pak said <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> leaders had met
							today and pledged full support of this action. I asked if this was
								<gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> assemblymen or party action. He
							said party leaders which include some assemblymen.</p>
                        <p>5. I said we recognized situation had become serious as result today's
							rioting but martial law was no solution to basic problems. What further
							measures did President contemplate to deal with student and public
							grievances. Pak said immediate problem was to deal with rioting and he
							had not given consideration to further aspects of problem.</p>
                        <p>6. I said we of course hoped that law and order would be quickly restored
							under martial law, but in light of April 1960 experience there was
							danger of massive students and popular action in streets. Should this be
							case it would create for U.S. Government a very serious problem of
							supporting his government face of general public disapproval. He said he
							recognized this, but if faced with uncontrollable popular opposition he
							would have to resign.</p>
                        <p>7. I said would it not be better to try to head off this possibility by
							announcing measures that would meet popular grievances. He repeated this
							must wait until law and order was restored. I then said “Mr. President,
							I know how painful this subject is but the situation is serious, and it
							is important that we speak frankly. Since March 23 at least a dozen
							Korean leaders, who support you, have told me that if martial law is
							invoked, you and your government will be in serious danger unless
								<persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> is removed. I
							want to make clear that I am not saying he should be removed, but this
							is what some of your most loyal supporters are saying.”</p>
                        <p>8. Pak replied that he was aware that <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>
							“has lost the confidence of many people, including some in the armed
							forces and in the party.” He then recounted events of May 31–June 2: his
							meeting with <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> on May 31 to discuss
							resignation; <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>'s resignation June 1;
							the danger of conflict in <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> if he did
							resign; the meeting with <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> leaders
							June 1 where only one voice, Chang Kyong-sun, supported resignation; Pak
							unsure what decision to make and decided to leave it to the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> party convention this summer. He said
							as I knew from previous conversation with him, he believes <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> should resign as Chairman of <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>, but not until this summer after <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement made. I did not pursue
							the matter except to say that public animus was directed at KCP and not
							Pak.</p>
                        <p>9. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> then referred to
							Pak's request to release two divisions and said he prepared do so with
							my concurrence.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName>'s report on this
								meeting was transmitted in telegram 60432 from CINCUNC, Seoul, June
								3. (Ibid.) The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions
								released from UNC operational control were the 6th and the
								28th.</note> I agreed. <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0060"/>General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> then compared
							current situation with April 1960, when he was in Korea, saying at that
							time there was universal hostility to fraudulently elected govt; this
							not the case now. However, Korean military forces were close to people
							and reflected their views and feelings. In April 1960 martial law people
							cheered arrival of armed forces. Gen Howze was not sure this would be
							the case this time. It would be unfortunate if people came to think that
							govt required presence of armed forces in order stay in power.</p>
                        <p>10. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> was assured
							that tanks would not be brought into Seoul and that live ammunition
							would be held by regimental commanders. Pak said armed forces would not
							fire except with his express authority.</p>
                        <p>11. I then said question will arise as to whether US Govt approved or
							disapproved martial law. I wanted make clear that President had not
							asked for our approval but asked for release of troops. I wished his
							govt could avoid any statement that implied our approval or agreement.
							This action was taken by ROK Govt in its sovereign capacity. President
							agreed.</p>
                        <p>12. I then repeated points we had made so there would be no
							misunderstanding.</p>
                        <p>A. We agreed situation was serious.</p>
                        <p>B. Invocation of martial law was decision of Korean Govt.</p>
                        <p>C. We agreed to release of troops at Korean Govt's request.</p>
                        <p>D. Martial law would not solve basic problems.</p>
                        <p>E. We hoped President would consider what measures might be announced to
							deal with popular grievances. In this connection that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> must be removed along
							with martial law had been expressed to me by Korean leaders who
							supported President.</p>
                        <p>13. President, <persName corresp="#p_KCOKCO1">Kim Chong-O</persName> and
							Min Defense said they understood clearly the views we had
								expressed.<note n="4" xml:id="d13fn4">The Department of State
								approved of the positions taken by <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> in this meeting and commented that the United
								States wanted to prevent repression and further disorders in Korea
								while urging the government to implement reforms to address
								grievances. (Telegram 1109 to Seoul, June 3; ibid.)</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Large student demonstrations with some civilian participation followed
							by declaration of martial law June 3 pose question what we should do and
							say.</p>
                        <p>2. Martial law may succeed in restoring public order but situation might
							quickly worsen if students resist, populace joins in, and troops are
							forced to extreme measures. April 1960 precedent might then be repeated.
							Govt expects next two or three days will be critical, since all
							information indicates students intend challenge martial law.</p>
                        <p>3. Should situation develop on these lines Pak govt might be able head it
							off by announcing immediate measures that will impress upon public that
							govt is serious about dealing with legitimate grievances.</p>
                        <p>4. Our effort should be directed to trying to help govt stabilize
							situation hence Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and I
							agreed to release of troops. If govt resorts only to force without
							remedial measures and is faced with a mass uprising, question will arise
							whether we can continue to support it in such circumstances. Time
							therefore has come for us to recommend to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> what actions it must take if it expects to weather
							difficulties and count on our support.</p>
                        <p>5. In this situation I recommend US take following position and so inform
							Pak:</p>
                        <p>A. US regards martial law as an emergency step to deal with public
							disorder.</p>
                        <p>B. Pak must take the necessary measures to establish public confidence in
							govt. These measures would include following:</p>
                        <p>(I) Martial law should be lifted as soon as possible. Govt must make
							plain it does not intend substitute martial law for normal processes
							over extended period of time.</p>
                        <p>(II) Govt should appeal to responsible leaders of opposition who are
							willing to cooperate in national crisis. Pak should call meetings with
							opposition leaders and leaders those elements (press, university,
							military) of community who command public respect and seek their advice
							on how to deal with situation. He should also make a personal effort to
							establish a favorable image <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0062"/>of
							himself before the public, in the process explaining the government's
							position on each pressing issue.</p>
                        <p>(III) <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> should
							resign from political offices and leave the country.</p>
                        <p>(IV) Democratic-Republican Party should be reconstituted, its corruption
							eliminated, its Secretariat vastly reduced, and its unwarranted
							interference in govt ended.</p>
                        <p>6. Govt's past ineptitude, corrupt practices, and subsequent loss of
							public confidence have caught up with it. We are no longer confident
							that Pak able control situation for any length of time. We do not
							predict that Pak govt cannot survive immediate situation, but
							indications are that he may try to do so by use of force and suppression
							opposition press, students, and possibly even national assembly. This
							would be neither acceptable nor viable solution.</p>
                        <p>7. With Dept's concurrence I intend see Pak at appropriate time and
							convey sense of foregoing.<note n="3" xml:id="d14fn3">The Department of

                        </p>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and I called on
							President Pak to ask how he viewed developments since martial law
							invoked and what was outlook.</p>
                        <p>2. He said next two or three days would be critical. Most university
							students had been sent home. He expected they would try to stir up
							trouble in the country. But if situation remained quiet, outlook would
							be favorable. He gave us numbers of “troublemakers” arrested in various
							categories which I am reporting separately.<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">In telegram 1624 from Seoul, June 8, <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> reported that Pak indicated a “total of 1344
								civilians and 523 students had been arrested” and an additional 191
								students were being sought. The telegram also contained detailed
								information about those arrests. (Ibid., POL 29 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> He then mentioned the several
							measures taken to remove popular grievances which he hoped would help
							stabilize situation: National reconstruction movement abolished; <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> Secretariat and staff cut back;
							legislation to be drafted to provide for publication of contributions to
							party funds; and <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>
							resignation as Chairman <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>. In a few
							days five hundred corrupt govt officials would be removed.</p>
                        <p>3. I said Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and I not
							only wished have his view of situation, but also wished tell him of
							disturbing reports which had come to us in last three days. Essence
							these reports was that some people were thinking in terms of maintaining
							martial law indefinitely because this was only way to govern Korea.
							Under martial law press and other criticism could be curbed, critics
							arrested, Assembly abolished if necessary, and it would then even be
							possible to settle with Japan. I asked President to comment on these
							reports.</p>
                        <p>4. He said it impossible govern Korea under martial law and hoped it
							could be lifted soon. At same time he has worried as to what would
							happen when martial law lifted. If this meant more rioting, resumption
							(sic) irresponsible Assembly criticism, continuing Assembly sabotage of
							govt administration by requiring continuous appearance <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0064"/>of Ministers in Assembly, and
							unrestrained press criticism, it would only lead to renewed rioting and
							martial law would have to be invoked again. He had to confess he was
							worried; he hoped martial law could be lifted soon. When Assembly met
							June 10 he expected it would vote for lifting martial law, but this did
							not seem a solution and he could not say when it would be possible.</p>
                        <p>5. To this evasive remark, I said I could not understand why he could not
							govern. He was elected as President. He had vast powers under the new
							constitution. His party with 110 of 175 [seats] had an easy majority in
							Assembly. Why could they not organize the work of the Assembly? Why
							could he not govern constitutionally? As for those [garble] spoke of
							martial law as the only solution, I could tell him that it would not be
							acceptable to the Korean people, to the Korean armed forces, or to
							Korea's friends abroad, including the US. We were committed to
							constitutional govt in Korea and were not prepared to support
							unconstitutional measures.</p>
                        <p>6. He said he agreed it was impossible to govern by force or by martial
							law. The trouble was that the public had lost confidence and trust in
							his govt.</p>
                        <p>7. I interrupted at this point and said General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> wished to say something about
							yesterday's incident involving paratroopers breaking into Donga Ilbo
							newspaper office (in which they threatened to sabotage printing press).
							Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> said he was deeply
							disturbed by this second incident involving special forces. This was a
							political act and it was apparent these troops were not properly
							disciplined. Washington authorities would take a serious view of this
							second incident. We were not prepared to use <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds to support undisciplined troops which threaten
							orderly processes. Pak said he had ordered an investigation of the
							matter. Gen <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> said that the
							troops should be withdrawn from capital security command and returned to
							their normal garrison.</p>
                        <p>8. I picked up thread of my part of conversation by saying I agreed basic
							problem was public distrust his govt and would be impossible stabilize
							situation or govern normally until confidence restored. I said I had
							been in Korea nearly three years. USG had done its utmost to be
							sympathetic to his problems and to help him both in days of military
							govt, during critical times last year, and since election.</p>
                        <p>I would now speak in way I had never done before. Most of his problems
							during past three years came from activities of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName>. He had been a
							disturbing and divisive force and his controversial activities had so
							occupied and distracted everyone's energies and attentions that the govt
							had never got down to its real job which is to govern the country. I
							reminded Pak of his frequent mention to me many difficulties <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> has caused him.</p>
                        <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0065"/>
                        <p>9. Present situation was terribly serious and once again <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> was the source of most of President
							Pak's trouble. He had once and for all to free himself of <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> so that he could restore people's
							confidence and get down to business of governing.</p>
                        <p>10. Freeing himself of a problem which had plagued and distracted him for
							so long was only way I could see to save objectives for which he had
							worked so hard for three years, his govt and constitutionalism. It would
							be a decisive move that would restore public confidence in him. It would
							bring back those who had been alienated in the last two years and enable
							him to broaden the basis of his support.</p>
                        <p>11. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> interjected at
							this point and said the armed forces were loyal to Pak but in a critical
							situation would not support <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>. This
							division in their loyalties could become a serious problem. General
								<persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> seriously doubted in
							the circumstances that the armed forces would shoot civilians to keep
								<gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> in office. He said <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> speaks of himself as though he were
							running Korea. It was essential that Pak assert it is he who is
							President and responsible for country, not <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. Pak asked if it were possible to arrange for <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> to go to US for study. I said we had made such
							arrangements in other cases for the President and could do so again. I
							suggested <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> should take his family and
							plan to stay for one or two years so as to give President freedom to
							govern and chance to stabilize situation without ever- present worry of
								<gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>'s imminent return. I stressed
							importance of an early departure.</p>
                        <p>13. Pak said he would speak to <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>
							tonight “and try to persuade him” to remove himself. I said it was in
							the interest of the country, Pak, constitution, and even <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> himself that he leave as quickly as
							possible. If he left soon there was a chance of internal stability and
							unity, a chance to reestablish Pak as a popular leader of the country,
							and a chance for a Japanese settlement. If he stayed I saw nothing but
							continuing trouble ahead.</p>
                        <p>14. As we got up to go I said casually that ten minutes before coming to
							Blue House I had been given a report that a list of Assemblymen slated
							for arrest was being prepared, which included a large number of
								anti-<gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> members of the Assembly as
							well as some opposition leaders. I asked if he knew anything of this. He
							said he did not. I said he and [I] had been caught by surprise several
							times by actions taken here over the last three years which we knew
							nothing about. I hoped this was not going to be repeated. He said with a
							smile that such arrests would require his signature. I smiled back and
							said if such arrests occurred there would be real trouble in Korea and
							we could not remain silent.</p>
                        <p>15. Comment: I have no certainty that Pak will follow the lead we have
							given him. We are letting our position be known to key govt and <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0066"/>military leaders on whom Pak
							relies and who will reinforce our advice to him. <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> remains capable of desperate action but may very
							probably come to realize balance of forces is strongly against him. In
							that case he will go quietly. If so we will need to cooperate in making
							possible one or two years of study in US for <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> and possibly one or more of his associates.</p>

                        <p>President Pak informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> on June 7, 1964, that Kim Chong-pil agreed to
							leave Korea and study in the United States. (Telegram 1621, June 7;
							National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
							1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Kim expressed an interest in attending a
							summer seminar followed by study of economics at a “good university” in
							the United States. He also suggested he be awarded a Department of State
							Leader Grant, which would, given the prestige associated with the grant,
							cloak his sudden departure and exile in respectability. (Telegram 1632
							from Seoul, June 10; ibid.) The Embassy and the Department of State
							agreed that Kim was an unsuitable candidate for a Leader Grant, since it
							allowed only short-term study and extended an official status to the
							grantee that the United States did not intend to offer Kim. (Telegram
							1635 from Seoul, June 10; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>The Department of State secured a private sponsor—the Southwestern
							Research Society in Dallas, Texas—enabling Kim to attend the 6-week
							International Seminar conducted by Henry Kissinger at Harvard that
							summer and to undertake academic study in the fall. Kim was scheduled to
							depart Seoul for Cambridge on June 18. (Telegrams 1133 and 1134 to

							KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> advocated that Kim's presence in

							but the time utilized as an “opportunity to train him and to alter his
							views.” (Telegram 1632 from Seoul, June 10; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</p>

								should be made now and implemented over the next 18
								months</hi>.<note n="4" xml:id="d17fn4">According to the attached

								Stroud to <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Solbert</persName>, both June

								division from its static commitment in Korea</hi> would <hi rend="italic">appreciably improve the U.S. defense posture</hi> not
							only in the Pacific area but world-wide. It is desirable to <hi rend="italic">retain the division as far forward as possible on U.S.
								territory in the Pacific, but final determination as to the
								relocation site should await completion of the above-mentioned
								studies</hi>. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s judgment, the <hi rend="italic">redeployment
								would not alter the U.S. strategic position in Korea or restrict the
								range of alternatives open to us</hi> in the event of renewed
							aggression there. He considers that the <hi rend="italic">U.S. troops
								that would remain in Korea</hi> (over 40,000 at present manning
							levels), <hi rend="italic">our ability rapidly to augment these <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0068"/>forces</hi>, improvements in
							our tactical air capability, the improved flexibility of our over-all
							military posture in the Pacific and our other actions to counter
							communism in Asia <hi rend="italic">would constitute convincing evidence
								of our purpose and will</hi>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> estimates that a <hi rend="italic">maximum
								annual savings of $22 million in balance of payments expenditures
								and $8 million in budgetary costs</hi> could be realized <hi rend="italic">under the most favorable redeployment conditions</hi>.
							This maximum savings <hi rend="italic">would be reduced</hi> to the
							extent that <hi rend="italic">new facilities were constructed</hi>, the
								<hi rend="italic">Forward Floating Depot augmented</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Korean economy compensated for the U.S.
								withdrawal</hi>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">State Department Views </p>
                        <p>My own view is that the <hi rend="italic">proposed redeployment would not
								be in U.S. interest at this time, as the risks are disproportionate
								to the relatively small balance of payments and military gains (if
								any)</hi>. However, <hi rend="italic">I do agree that the matter
								periodically be reviewed</hi>, possibly again this coming
							December.</p>
                        <p>My view may be summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Consequences for Our Over-all Far Eastern Position—Our
								position in Asia is under heavy strain this year</hi>. A move of the
							sort proposed would entail the considerable danger of <hi rend="italic">injecting further unsettling effects</hi>. Particularly at a time
							when our position in Southeast Asia is so critical, I would wish to <hi rend="italic">avoid any semblance whatsoever of an implied U.S.
								willingness to withdraw our power from the Far Eastern area</hi>. I
							believe that Peiping's strategy is directed at having us <hi rend="italic">tire of the frustrating problems in that area</hi> of
							the world, and I would not want to encourage them in the erroneous
							belief that <hi rend="italic">they are succeeding</hi>. If it were
							possible to have the entire division deployed in a forward area in the
							Pacific such as Okinawa, Guam or the Philippines, this might have a
							positive political and psychological effect. However, such a deployment
							would entail major construction costs and other difficulties. The
							alternative of withdrawal to the U.S. of all or even a large portion of
							the forces would give exactly the wrong political signal. While I <hi rend="italic">do not challenge the view of the Secretary of Defense
								that we may have the capacity<note n="5" xml:id="d17fn5">The word
									“capacity” is double underlined.</note> of redeploying the
								forces in question</hi> to the Far East as required, <hi rend="italic">the principal issue is not our capabilities but what
								both our allies and the Communists read as our intentions</hi>.
							Withdrawal of a U.S. division from the Far East, no matter what our
							technical capabilities may be, will be read as a <hi rend="italic">U.S.
								intention to disengage</hi>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Consequences in Korea</hi>—Moreover, the redeployment
							would <hi rend="italic">undermine Korean confidence in U.S. military
								capabilities and intentions just as the reorganized civil
								Government</hi> addresses itself with apparent determination and new
							promise to a <hi rend="italic">settlement with Japan, economic
								stabilization</hi> and, largely through these means, strengthening
							of its own position <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0069"/>and <hi rend="italic">achievement of a measure of political stability.
								Realization of all these goals, in which the U.S. has so large a
								stake, would be seriously jeopardized</hi>. The withdrawal would
							also inevitably and undesirably focus attention throughout the Far East
							on the already <hi rend="italic">heavy nuclear emphasis in our Korean
								posture</hi>. In my recent discussions with Chiang Kai-shek he
							sharply rejected any possibility of the use of nuclear weapons by the
							U.S. in Asia as being completely contrary to U.S. interests. Our other
							allies could be expected to take an even more vigorous stand in
							opposition. <hi rend="italic">Since the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not
								endorse a reduction of U.S. forces in Korea unless a prior
								commitment to a nuclear strategy is accepted, the entire military
								rationale of the proposal gives me serious concern</hi>. In this
							connection, if the elements of the division which it is proposed be sent
							to Alaska are given responsibilities in terms of Alaskan defense, it is
							doubtful that they will be immediately available for rapid deployment to
							the Far East in case of need.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Financial Consequences</hi>—As for the effects of such
							a redeployment upon the U.S. balance of payments and budget, <hi rend="italic">Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s savings estimates specifically do not
								take into account construction of pre-stockage facilities on land
								and sea or the providing of necessary funds to compensate the Korean
								economy and stabilization program for the loss of income (estimated
								at $15 million) from the redeployed division</hi>. The studies of
								<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and State staffs indicate that
							the <hi rend="italic">net annual balance of payments benefit</hi> after
							these factors are taken into account <hi rend="italic">would be very
								small</hi> (probably negative if a brigade were deployed to the

                        <p>At the same time I fully share the view of the Secretary of Defense that
							our force posture in Korea results in inflexibilities in the use of our
							military resources. I have given considerable thought to this problem
							and am persuaded that we can find a way which is politically feasible,
							assuming it is also militarily feasible, to develop a more responsive
							force posture in the Far East. <hi rend="italic">Basically, my proposal
								is that we transform one of the two divisions in Korea into a mobile
								reserve stationed in Korea but available for meeting crises
								elsewhere in the Far East. I do not feel that we must accept
								complete inflexibility in our Korean deployment, particularly when
								events are making clear the potential requirement for U.S. ground
								forces elsewhere in the Far East.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I recognize that there may be a reluctance on the part of the Koreans to
							see us transform one of our divisions into a mobile Far Eastern area
							reserve. However, I think we can make a strong case that the most
							effective way to deter Communist adventurism anywhere in the Far East,
							including Korea, is by demonstrating our ability to deal immediately <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0070"/>and effectively with aggression
							wherever it occurs throughout the region.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me time to make this adjustment in the use of our military
							resources which are, after all, not unlimited. <hi rend="italic">I am
								prepared to explore the feasibility of this proposal with Secretary
									<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and, if found
								militarily feasible, to work out a specific plan for your

							prospects since devaluation,<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">The Korean
								Government announced a devaluation of the won in May.</note> i.e.,
							reversal of capital flight, record-breaking exports in June, better than

                        <p>2. U.S. Assistance: President asked me to comment on requests made by

									<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Director James S. Killen on

                        </p>
                        <p>A. No prospect of additional <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> this
							year;</p>
                        <p>B. Development loans for fertilizer plants would be sympathetically

                        <p>C. Buying <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> from Ulsan refinery for
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US forces presented
							difficult problems for us owing to world-wide policy, but matter was
							being studied;</p>
                        <p>D. Future of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer program under
							study, did not believe it would be suspended, but may be amended to
							provide for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funding of raw
							materials;</p>
                        <p>E. Request for support for large highway development program was new
							request. It was under study, but not likely to be given high
							priority;</p>
                        <p>F. Increased Korean Exports to Viet-Nam. In reply to his request for
							waiving “Buy American” policy in order to permit use of U.S. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> dollars to pay for Viet-Nam imports
							from Korea, I said our policy was likely to be flexible. Responsibility
							for finding items needed in Viet-Nam rested with Koreans, and I urged
							that a vigorous effort be made to sell in this market.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan: President said if U.S.
							could involve itself more openly and actively in the negotiations it
							would make it possible for him to overcome domestic, political and
							student opposition. Korean fear of Japanese economic domination, fear of
							being deserted by the U.S. and fear of “deals” between Korean and
							Japanese in respect of use of $600 million were real however
							unjustified. If U.S. would take initiative to form a consortium of
							consultative aid group and make long-term aid commitment to Korea it
							would be of immeasurable help in dealing with Korean fears. He appealed
							for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to involve
							himself directly in talks with Japanese and Koreans to work out a
							solution on these lines by the end of this year. I said Dept anxious to
							be helpful and we are now exploring with Japanese and Germans
							possibilities for a new approach to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement on these lines. It unlikely Secretary
							would commit himself to direct involvement unless and until agreement
							reached beforehand. Meantime most hopeful line of attack was improved
							Japanese purchase of Korean exports. Reports from Japan suggested some
							progress might be made in this direction and we were doing our best to
							encourage it.</p>
                        <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0072"/>
                        <p>4. Martial Law: I urged him to lift martial law. I reminded him that
							Embassy had predicted student trouble week of June 1 when <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName>, General Min Ki-shik and
							others were saying that gov threats to crack down on students had broken
							the back of the student demonstrations and that agitation would subside.
							I predicted that if his govt tried to bull-doze through the Assembly
							student control law, there would be most serious trouble in Assembly and
							in country. I urged him to support Assembly Speaker's efforts to develop
							agreements between govt and opposition moderates and to merge his own
							and PriMin's separate effort with those of the Speaker. I said that
							General Min Ki-shik's view that he could force these laws through the
							Assembly under martial law were dangerous and doomed to failure. This
							approach was opposed by every sensible person and by many of the
							commanding officers in the armed forces. I said General Min's
							bull-dozing and erratic behavior had lost him the confidence of General
								<persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and U.S. Govt.</p>
                        <p>5. President replied that he was aware of dangers and did not plan to try
							to bull-doze the laws through the Assembly under conditions of martial
							law. He and <persName>Chong</persName> Il-kwon were working together on
							this matter and would work with the Speaker of the Assembly in whom he
							had great confidence. They hoped to get agreement in principle with
							opposition that Assembly would pass such laws to deal with the
							possibility of renewed student and press agitation. Then he would lift
							martial law. I gathered from this and from a separate conversation
							earlier with PriMin that they were now engaged in feeling out the
							opposition, and testing how far they can go in passing restrictive
							legislation.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName>: I said reports
							from Washington, Japan and Korea were coming in that Kim Chong-pil had
							stated he would return to Korea in Sept and that I was under instruction
							from the Dept to raise this matter with him. He said he had told Kim
							prior to his departure that he was to plan to stay away for a year or
							more and that he would look at this matter again in about a year's time.
							He said he had not made any statement on this in order to save Kim's
							face. I could assure the Dept that Kim would not return in less than a
							year.</p>
                        <p>7. Comment: Pak was relaxed, attentive and extremely friendly during all
							conversations. Only during discussion of martial law and cooperation
							with opposition did he become indecisive and slightly evasive. In my
							view he has not determined his final position on these questions. What
							is most worrying is that he remains particularly ill-disposed toward
							opposition and anti-govt press, and his tendency is to think in terms of
							force rather than compromise.</p>
                        <p>8. On economic questions I believe Pak readily appreciates importance of
							stabilization program and expect he will keep our views in mind when
							faced with inflationary tendencies on part some Cabinet <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0073"/>ministers. Pak also made clear his
							continuing commitment to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
							normalization, but now is looking for a way to break impasse presented
							by student and political opposition.</p>

                        <p>1. Recent communications from the Commander in Chief, United Nations
							Command (CINCUNC), indicate the need for guidance for his use in
							discussions initiated by Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) Government officials concerning military force levels
							in Korea and the Korean Military Assistance Program. Inasmuch as these
							matters have political and economic as well as military implications,
							your approval of guidance to CINCUNC is desired.</p>
                        <p>2. On 17 and 18 June 1964, General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> (CINCUNC) was visited by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Minister of Defense <persName corresp="#p_KSKS1">Kim
								Sung-eun</persName>, who indicated he had five proposals he would
							like to present to the US Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense and
							to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, should he have the opportunity
							to visit Washington. These proposals were as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. That <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces not be
							reduced.</p>
                        <p>b. That US forces in Korea not be reduced.</p>
                        <p>c. That military aid to Korea be increased.</p>
                        <p>d. That the MAP Transfer Program—Korea be suspended for at least two
							years.</p>
                        <p>e. That the United States support financially the needed pay increase for
							the Korean armed forces. </p>
                        <p>3. The views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the above subjects are
							summarized in the Appendix hereto.<note n="2" xml:id="d19fn2">Not
								printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0074"/>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have concluded that CINCUNC should be
							furnished the following guidance for use in discussions initiated by
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government officials:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Force
							Levels</p>
                        <p>(1) In view of the current situation in Southeast Asia, the United States
							does not favor any reduction in military capability in the Far East.
							Therefore, the United States considers that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces should remain at the current levels.</p>
                        <p>(2) Any announcement of reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							forces prior to an announcement to withdraw a portion of the US forces
							stationed in Korea could be expected to have an adverse effect on
							congressional support of the Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. US Forces</p>
                        <p>(1) The United States does not intend to lessen its over-all military
							capability in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>(2) No indication should be given <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government officials that the United States is considering withdrawing
							one division from Korea.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">c. Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>(1) There are no immediate prospects for relief from the pressures of
							reduced funding.</p>
                        <p>(2) There are many competing requirements for funds under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. The Department of Defense is obliged
							to seek a strategic balance world-wide within the dollar ceiling
							appropriated by the US Congress.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Department of Defense recognizes the contributions to Free World
							security being made by the Republic of Korea, and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> need for support under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">d. <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer
							Program</p>
                        <p>(1) The basic principle of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							Transfer Program, to encourage a country to shoulder more of the
							operations and maintenance cost of its defense burden, is valid. Through
							it a greater portion of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> can be
							devoted to investment purposes.</p>
                        <p>(2) The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer Program must be
							applied with flexibility, submitting it to frequent review, extending
							its time phasing, or reducing it as necessary when continued
							implementation will result in further reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces below Joint Strategic Objectives
							Plan (JSOP) force objectives; but cancellation of the program should be
							avoided.</p>
                        <p>(3) As stipulated in the Military Assistance Manual, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> will support approximately two-thirds
							of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense budget, and the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense budget should be

							Foreign Ministers conference to be held in Seoul in April 1965 warranted
							by the “changing situation in Southeast Asia [that] has increased need
							for promotion of friendship and cooperation of free nations in area.”
							The Foreign Ministers of Australia, the Republic of China, Malaysia, New
							Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and South Vietnam, as well as Japan,
							if the attendees desired, were to be invited. The Koreans envisaged the
							conference serving to “maintain peace and prosperity in Asia, strengthen
							region's defense against Communist subversion, consolidate friendly
							ties, and promote economic and cultural cooperation.” The Foreign Office
							also believed the conference would enhance support within Korea for a
							settlement with Japan as well as enhance the international prestige <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0076"/>of the Republic of Korea.
							(Telegram 197 from Seoul, August 31, and airgram A–135 from Seoul,
							September 1; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
							Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Initially the Department of State
							expressed misgivings about the feasibility of the proposal because of
							vagueness surrounding the purpose of the conference, doubt about the
							Foreign Minister's ability to organize and focus the conference, and
							uncertainty about the willingness of the invited countries to attend.
							(Telegram 196 to Seoul, September 1; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>After further consideration the Department responded that the conference
							could achieve positive results by fostering stronger ties among the
							Asian nations friendly to the United States and the Western powers,
							enhancing a sense of solidarity among the participants, and reducing the
							isolation of the Republic of Korea. (Telegram 434 to Seoul, November 18;
							ibid.) The Embassy in Seoul agreed in general, but believed the
							conference could be successful only if attended by most or all the
							invited Foreign Ministers. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> suggested that the Republic of Korea would support
							efforts by the United States to urge all countries to attend. (Telegram
							494 from Seoul, November 24; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On December 4 the Department of State informed the Embassy in Seoul and
							the other relevant Asian countries of its support for the proposed
							Foreign Ministers Conference. After stating the potential objectives of
							the meeting—strengthening intra-Asian relations, strengthening Korea's
							international position, reducing the feelings of isolation within Korea
							and the Republic of China—the Department provided a list of topics that
							could be fruitfully addressed at the conference: “1) security against
							Communist military threat”; “2) insurgency and counter-insurgency,
							including security, economic, social and psychological countermeasures”;
							“3) economic development”; and “4) expansion of regional collaboration
							in diplomatic, economic and perhaps other spheres.” The Department
							suggested that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>
							discuss those points and other aspects of the conference with the Korean
							Foreign Minister. (Telegram 485 to Seoul, December 4; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Within a few days, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> had spoken to officials in the Foreign Office and
							informed Washington of Korea's ideas about the conference, of its
							receptivity to the Department's suggested topics and agenda, and similar
							matters. (Telegram 511 from Seoul, December 8; ibid.) As a result, the
							Department notified the Embassy in Seoul and in the Asian countries
							expected to participate in the conference of its renewed support for the
							conference. Although it did “not wish to get out in front or to appear
							to be promoting this conference,” the Department suggested that U.S.
							support for the meeting be made known and steps taken to ensure
							participation by as many countries as possible. (Telegram 497 to Seoul
							and repeated to other Asian capitals, December 10; ibid.)</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>As you well know, one of our major current projects in Seoul is the
							negotiation of a Status of Forces Agreement. Since arriving here, I have
							been able to take a thorough look at these negotiations, which have been
							in course for two years. I find that they have now reached the stage at
							which the fundamental unresolved issue of waiver must be resolved or the
							negotiations will become deadlocked. I have just come out of a meeting
							with the Country Team in which we have approved a recommendation with
							respect to that issue which we hope may make agreement possible. This
							recommendation is contained in Airgram A–133.</p>
                        <p>While there are a number of unresolved differences of position, the
							determinative question now at issue is the very simple one of whether we
							continue to insist on an automatic advance waiver of jurisdiction by the
							Koreans in all criminal cases in which they have the right of primary
							jurisdiction. We have not asked, or at least we have not obtained, such
							a provision in any other Status of Forces Agreement to which we are a
							party.</p>
                        <p>All concerned here, including General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and his colleagues who have worked on this
							problem, are convinced that our proposed modification will adequately
							protect US interests. All of our negotiators are convinced that if we
							insist upon automatic advance waiver there will be no agreement. They do
							not think that a recess of negotiations will or can affect this basic
							situation.</p>
                        <p>Even after my short stay here, I do not see how any Korean government
							could defend in the Assembly the acceptance of such a waiver provision,
							involving as it does a relinquishment of sovereignty to an extent
							greater than that of any other country, including Japan, in which we
							have forces.</p>
                        <p>It is our desire to see this government negotiate and put into effect a
							settlement with Japan. To do so it needs every additional measure <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0078"/>of public and legislative support
							which it can earn or otherwise obtain. Conclusion of a satisfactory
								<gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> will be a feather in its cap.
							Acceptance of our present waiver provision would almost certainly lead
							to its defeat on a major issue, if not to its downfall.</p>
                        <p>Allowing the negotiations to drag on fruitlessly would be harmful to both
							the government and ourselves, particularly if, as is most likely, the
							respective positions of the parties on the issue dividing us become
							known. This year we have already had student demonstrations protesting
							almost every issue except the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
							negotiations. Should these negotiations now break down, it is not at all
							difficult to envisage future student demonstrations protesting U.S.
							“insincerity.”</p>
                        <p>What we propose in essence in our Airgram is that the Koreans agree in
							advance to grant our request for a waiver except in cases in which the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government has a special
							interest. In our judgment these cases would be rare. However, provision
							would be made for a review, first by the Joint Committee which is to be
							set up to implement the agreement, and later by diplomatic negotiation,
							if necessary. If these consultations failed, the Koreans would not have
							to grant the waiver. We would, however, under the provision as we
							propose it, retain custody of the accused before, during, and after
							trial and through all appeal procedures. If we were convinced that
							someone was really being railroaded we could simply ship him out of the
							country, undesirable as this action would be.</p>
                        <p>Airgram A–133 was reviewed and approved by the Country Team. Because of
							the military chain of command, General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> was unable to concur formally, but has informed
								<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> of his agreement with
							the Embassy message. I have informally given Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> my views during his recent
							visit to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Thus the position is that General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName>, all of his colleagues, and the Embassy are
							convinced that the provision we propose would adequately protect our
							personnel. We are equally convinced that insist- ence on automatic
							advance waiver will mean that there will be no agreement. We believe
							that the terms we propose, if accepted, will result in an agreement more
							satisfactory than <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>'s we have with
							other countries. We think that prompt conclusion of a <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> is in our interest. We therefore
							bespeak your sympathetic consideration of our recommendation and
							favorable action on it.<note n="3" xml:id="d21fn3">The Department of
								State accepted the Embassy's approach to the issue, but redrafted
								the proposal to combine “an automatic advance waiver formula with a
								right of recall by the Korean authorities under certain specified
								circumstances.” The approach combined the formula contained in the
									<gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> agreement with the Federal
								Republic of Germany and the Republic of China. (Airgram A–86 to
								Seoul, December 1; ibid.)</note>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. In view of the possibility of a coup d'etat in the Republic of Korea
								(<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) and its impact on the
							operational control of the Korean Armed Forces exercised by the United
							States through the Commander in Chief, United Nations Command (CINCUNC),
							the Joint Chiefs of Staff have given consideration to appropriate
							courses of action available to CINCUNC.</p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the success of a coup may well
							be determined in the course of a few hours and that decisions as to the
							release of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops and the nature of
							US involvement may have to be made by CINCUNC on short notice. CINCUNC
							should be provided appropriate guidance concerning approved courses of
							action available to him.</p>
                        <p>3. After considering the factors affecting the stability of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and the nature of US
							involvement discussed in Appendix B hereto,<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">Appendix B, “Korean Coup Analysis,” discussed the widespread social
								discontent and political dissent pervading Korea stemming from
								economic adversity and political instability. A particular threat to
								the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government noted in the
								analysis was Pak's continued support of Kim Chong-il, whose return
								from exile had the potential to “divide the military leaders and
								seriously jeopardize the stability of the regime.”</note> the Joint
							Chiefs of Staff have concluded that:</p>
                        <p>a. An attempted coup d'etat in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is
							possible. The most likely source of successful action to unseat the
							present regime is the military.</p>
                        <p>b. A successful procommunist coup is unlikely due to the presence of
							strong United Nations and South Korean Armed Forces, effective internal
							security, and the anticommunist orientation of the people.</p>
                        <p>4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. The following alternative courses of action be approved and
							coordinated with the Secretary of State:</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0080"/>
                        <p>(1) The US forces remain neutral in any power struggle by noncommunist
							factions, strive to avoid bloodshed, and maintain responsiveness within
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces to the United
							Nations Command.</p>
                        <p>(2) Through the Military Assistance Program, continue current US support
							for pro-Western <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed Forces and
							Government. Through the country team, support the Ambassador, as
							appropriate, to accelerate social and economic reforms and to eliminate
							corruption and illegal measures.</p>
                        <p>(3) In the event of a coup or uprising instigated by communist or other
							anti-US elements, the United States support the recognized government
							and/or those elements of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Armed
							Forces who are unquestionably pro-US.</p>
                        <p>(4) In the event that the recognized government of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> requests release of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops to suppress a coup or uprising,
							CINCUNC should comply provided it does not, in his judgment, unduly
							weaken his over-all military posture in Korea.</p>
                        <p>(5) On the other hand, should anti-Government leaders, even though pro-US
							and anticommunist, request release of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops from CINCUNC control to aid in the overthrow of
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government, the proposal will be
							referred to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>(6) If necessary, CINCUNC as COMUS, Korea, in concert with the country
							team, should temporarily suspend POL and other items of the Military
							Assistance Program as the situation warrants.</p>
                        <p>(7) In carrying out any of the above courses of action, US support must
							not include the involvement of US military action without prior approval
							of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, except as authorized by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> OPLAN 85–63 which has been
							approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">Appendix B explains that “<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> OPLAN No. 85–63 provides for US military
								operations under COMUS, Korea, as a last resort, in concert with
									<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to prevent seizure of
								the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government in the event a
								coup were to be instigated by communists.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(8) Approved US military action in support of US unilateral policy should
							be carried out under COMUS, Korea.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have spoken to me about
							President Pak's “intention” to visit the United States in April 1965.
							They requested that I consult Washington on such a visit. Obviously they
							are seeking an invitation for a state visit.</p>
                        <p>I am favorably disposed toward the idea. As you know, aside from his
							quick trip to attend President Kennedy's funeral, President Pak has not
							been to the United States since his official visit in 1961 when he was
							Chairman of the Supreme Council.</p>
                        <p>A visit in the spring of 1965 will be well-timed. I do not know what the
							future holds for our principle concern over the Korea-Japan <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0082"/>question but there is no question that
							we will still be in the throes of trying to achieve the goal early next
							spring. In one way or another a Pak visit will provide the occasion for
							some support on the issue. If negotiations with Japan have been resumed
							by then and progress made, Pak will be looking for U.S. blessing to ease
							his task of gaining public acceptance in Korea. If the negotiations are
							on dead center, a visit may be used to get the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> moving again.</p>
                        <p>There are other matters of mutual interest that would benefit from the
							visit. It could be the occasion for some high level exchange on such
							things as force levels and economic stabilization. The Koreans would no
							doubt seek to gain reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment here. Moreover,
							President Pak will hope to use his visit to demonstrate U.S. acceptance
							of his government and himself. He can use such a vote of confidence and
							we are disposed to grant it in the interest of confirming our support
							for constitutionalism and orderly processes in Korea.</p>
                        <p>I am putting this proposal to you in this form in order to allow a little
							judicious exploring of the White House view prior to your coming here
							next month. If a visit from Pak in April or thereabouts is completely
							out of the question given President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s desires and schedule, we will of course try
							and dissuade the Koreans. That will not be easy, as we can presume they
							have their hearts set on it or we would never have received the
							request.</p>
                        <p>We can discuss this further when you get here. We are all
							enthusiastically awaiting your arrival and the opportunity to share with
							you first hand our thoughts and interests.</p>

                        <p>We are facing serious problems in trying to maintain the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces adequately with the
							original $146 million planned for Korea, which we believe is a
							rockbottom requirement.</p>
                        <p>The MAP for Korea in recent years had been in excess of $200 million,
							until <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1964, when a cut to $153 million
							necessitated a sharp drop in investment funds. The additional $20
							million cut now proposed for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1965
							would in effect cancel all new modernization programs in 1965, with the
							exception of the introduction of F–5 aircraft. Some previously
							programmed projects probably would also be jeopardized. There would be
							no practical alternative to these cuts in investment, since the funding
							for operations has already been reduced to less than the necessary
							minimum. Ammunition, supplies and equipment are now in short supply for
							desired training programs. The Korean Government cannot at present
							increase its share of the burden. Partly because of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer Program, pressure on the
							Korean defense budget has made it necessary to maintain pay and
							allowances at a detrimentally low level.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">At a
								meeting between Korean and Embassy officials on September 25, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Minister of Defense and Chief of
								Staff reported that “pay and allowance, clothing and subsistence so
								inadequate that commanding officers are forced to devote their
								efforts to morale problems at expense of troop training.” The
								Ambassador as well as the U.S. military leadership in Korea had been
								concerned about the problem for some time. (Telegram 289 from Seoul,
								September 26; ibid.)</note>

                        <p>The present government's efforts to move forward with the settlement with
							Japan and with economic development are hindered by its limited public
							support. Of critical importance has been the support it has received
							from the military. The proposed cut would shortly become apparent to
							Korean military leaders and possibly to the political Opposition as
							well. It would be interpreted as evidence of lack of U.S. support of the
							Pak administration, and a confirmation of fears and allegations that the
							U.S. is engaged in a program of “withdrawal” from Korea. The capacity of
							the Pak administration to govern probably would be seriously impaired.
							The prospects for a Korean-Japanese settlement and economic progress
							would be greatly reduced, and the possibility that the government might
							be overthrown by a coup or revolt would be substantially increased.</p>

                        <p>1. I told the President that we had received a very glowing report from
							Ambassador McGhee about the success of his visit to Bonn and the
							satisfaction of the German Government in it. I congratulated him on
							behalf of the Secretary. He said that he had been very pleased by the
							warmth of his reception by German officials.</p>
                        <p>2. I said the reason for my call was to deliver a message from President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> about Viet Nam.<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">Transmitted in telegram 531 to Seoul, December
								17. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was concerned
							about the situation in Viet Nam and was making a great effort to broaden
							and deepen the basis of international support for the present
							government. Fifteen nations and over a thousand non-Americans were
							already helping in Viet Nam <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0086"/>and
							the presence of a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military unit
							there was very much appreciated. Nevertheless, the President was asking
							a number of other countries to give their support and was asking some
							countries, particularly Far Eastern countries, who were already
							contributing, to increase their contribution.</p>
                        <p>4. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was not
							asking for combat troops.<note n="3" xml:id="d28fn3">The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government was willing to send
								combat troops to Vietnam, as the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Joint Chiefs of Staff reminded the
								Embassy on November 3. (Telegram 425 from Seoul, November 4; ibid.,
								DEF 19 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Embassy had also received
								information about the formation of the Freedom Defense Volunteer
								Corps. Being formed with support from the Korean branch of the Asian
								People's Anti-Communist League, the unit would purportedly fight in
								Vietnam or in any other country facing a Communist threat. (Airgram
								A–265 from Seoul, December 3; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 13–8 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
							This was not that kind of war. He had in mind possibly engineer or
							construction units, transport pilots, <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>'s, medical or service units. He would like to know if
							the Korean Government would feel able to increase its present
							contribution.</p>
                        <p>5. The President replied that his government wished to support the free
							world effort in Viet Nam in every possible way to the extent of its
							resources because he agreed that this was very important to the Free
							World and he supported the U.S. policy of helping the government of
							South Viet Nam. I said that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would deeply appreciate this reaction, at which
							point Yi Hu-rak intervened to say that the President would give his
							answer after he had consulted with his staff. I had already said that I
							did not expect the President to give me a firm answer right away, but
							asked that he let me know his decision soon so that General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> could begin to discuss details
							with the Minister of National Defense. The President promised to do
							so.</p>
                        <p>6. The President said he did not know the new Viet Nam Prime Minister but
							had the impression that he was quite capable. I said that we felt that
							the Prime Minister had courage, the Deputy Prime Minister political
							skill, and that General Khanh was a good soldier, so we felt the
							government was promising. However, it had not yet achieved a firm
							political basis and we felt that its doing so was a fundamental
							prerequisite to success against the Viet Cong. Further support from the
							Free World would help materially in this respect.</p>
                        <p>7. The President said that he felt that more vigorous action by the
							United States would be helpful in defeating the Viet Cong and in getting
							the support of wavering neighboring countries. He said that Korea was
							willing to send two combat divisions if necessary. Moreover, there were
							a large number of recently discharged veterans in Korea who were willing
							to go to Viet Nam to fight if they could be equipped and
							transported.</p>
                        <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0087"/>
                        <p>8. I explained that we felt that the time had not yet come for
							introduction of outside combat troops but promised to pass on the
							President's views to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. I thanked him again for his favorable reaction to our President's
							request.</p>
                        <p>10. Half an hour after getting back to my office I received a call from
							the Blue House saying that I could ask General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> to get in touch with <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> on this matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">After receiving information from <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> listing the Korean

									<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> reported on his
								meeting with Pak concerning the return of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName>, and in telegram 553

                        </p>
                        <p>1. After courtesy call by Senator Monroney December 21 I took President
							Pak aside and said that I had thought over very carefully what he had
							said to me on December 18 about return of <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">On December

								no direct contact with Kim, that he heard from others that Kim
								planned to return, and that he could do nothing if Kim decided to
								come back to Korea. Pak also claimed that Kim's return would not
								affect the talks with Japan, since “<persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
									Chong-pil</persName> was not all that important.” (Telegram 551
								from Seoul, December 19; ibid.)</note> I nevertheless continued to
							feel that it would cause a great deal of trouble for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan negotiations and for political

							that I wanted him to know that what I had said to him on Saturday was
							not only my own personal opinion but that I had conveyed to him this
							message by specific instructions of the Department of State.<note n="4" xml:id="d29fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> explained to Pak that
								Kim's “mere presence in the country would create controversy” and
								instability within Korea at a time when internal affairs and the
								talks with Japan were going well. He reminded Pak that student
								demonstrations earlier in the year focused on Kim's involvement in
								the negotiations with Japan and asked him if he wanted to risk a
								return of that situation by allowing Kim to reemerge in Korea.
								(Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. At these words, the President drew in his breath sharply, looked down
							at the floor for some time, shook his head and said: “I understand.”</p>
                        <p>3. At the door the President said that he could not force <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> to stay away but that he would try to
							find some way to advise him very strongly to do so. He could not say
							that it was because the US wanted him to stay away. Some other reason
							would have to be found. I agreed it would be a very great mistake if
								<gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> were told that he would have to
							stay away because that was what Americans wanted. This was a Korean
							decision and I was simply giving the President, as a friend of his and a
							friend of Korea's, the advice that a friend would give when asked. I
							repeated that it would be a great mistake to attribute <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>'s exile to pressure from the US. The
							President said he hoped that the US would not continue its opposition to
								<gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss>'s return.</p>
                        <p>4. Above represents progress and indicates that President Pak got more of
							my message on December 19 than Yi Hu-rak indicated and had been thinking
							about it. But this battle is by no means yet won. I therefore renew
							recommendation para 2 Embtel 553.<note n="5" xml:id="d29fn5">In telegram

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Certain hopeful signs appeared in South Korean political life over the
							past few months: President Pak has shown greater awareness of the value
							of persuasion and compromise in dealing with opposition; the parties are
							beginning to submerge factional differences, and some opposition
							elements have cooperated with the administration on certain less
							controversial issues. The economic situation has improved in certain
							respects, and the military has firmly supported the government. (Paras.
							4–5, 15)</p>
                        <p>B. Nonetheless, there remain a number of underlying sources of
							instability and obstacles to achievement of a real sense of national
							unity and direction. The government has failed to convince many Koreans
							that it represents much more than a continuation of the unpopular and of
							the corrupt military junta which it replaced. It has shed its
							authoritarianism sufficiently so that active, often irresponsible,
							opposition elements have been able to block its initiatives and work
							sometimes openly for its downfall. Political conflict is often more a
							contest for personal power than a controversy over issues, and the
							regime remains ultimately dependent on the support of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military. (Paras. 1–3, 11)</p>
                        <p>C. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is not likely to enjoy genuine
							political stability in the foreseeable future, but there is at least an
							even chance that the next two or three years will prove reasonably
							tranquil if the regime can handle certain issues. Among the most
							critical of these are a settlement <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0091"/>with Japan—economically desirable but politically unpopular; [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
							declassified</hi>]; factionalism within the ruling Democratic Republican
							Party; and a variety of chronic popular grievances, particularly among
							students and intellectuals. Serious trouble could arise over any of
							these issues, and while the military is likely to support the regime in
							most circumstances, its support cannot be guaranteed in all cases.
							(Paras. 6–14)</p>
                        <p>D. Lasting stability is not likely unless further progress is made in
							improving a weak and imbalanced economy, heavily dependent on
							large-scale US assistance and burdened with serious problems of
							unemployment and a population growing at nearly three percent per year.
							Grounds for optimism are very limited, though a settlement with
							Japan—for which chances are about even during the next year—would help.
							In the best circumstances, however, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will remain a petitioner for large and continuing US
							assistance for years to come. (Paras. 15–28)</p>
                        <p>E. We believe that, during the next few years, the unification issue is
							likely to represent a more insistent problem for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders than in the past. The North
							will probably continue to keep the initiative on unification, and
							sentiment within the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will make it
							more difficult for Seoul to stand pat. Pyongyang may fare better in the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> than in the past, particularly if
							Communist China is admitted or otherwise significantly improves its
							international status. We do not believe, however, that the trend is
							likely either to bring about the fall of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government or move it to contemplate unification on
							Pyongyang's terms unless the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> suffers
							a series of unprecedented domestic disasters or becomes convinced that
							US support is weakening. (Paras. 29–41)</p>

                        <p>On January 26, 1965, the Korean National Assembly approved sending
							additional military personnel to Vietnam after contentious opposition by
							members of the Civil Rule Party and the Democratic Party. The Civil Rule
							Party, led by <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po-sun</persName>,
							distrusted the Pak <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0092"/>regime and
							feared that the dispatch of more troops would leave South Korea
							vulnerable to North Korean subversion by weakening its defenses. Both
							opposition parties also criticized the Minister of Defense for making
							conflicting statements regarding the impetus behind the proposal, at
							times claiming that the Korean Government initiated the proposal to send
							troops to Vietnam, at others referring to a request from the Republic of
							Vietnam or from the United States. A Civil Rule Party member also
							privately informed the Embassy that because of “cuts in US foreign aid
							program it is doubtful <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> really
							intends to persevere in Vietnamese war and that it is difficult to
							understand why <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should send troops to
							become involved in situation which appears hopeless.” (Telegram 647 from
							Seoul, January 21; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
							Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET

                        </p>
                        <p>When the proposal came before the Assembly for a vote, its passage was
							complicated by the Assembly's decision to vote by secret ballot. That
							decision prompted <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po-sun</persName> and
							23 other members of the Civil Rule Party to walk out in protest. The
							dispatch of troops was approved by an overwhelming majority of the
							remaining members, all representing the ruling Democratic Republican
							Party. (Telegram 670 from Seoul, January 26; ibid.) Afterward President
							Pak issued a statement praising the results of the vote and
							characterizing it “as a signal for Korea to ‘to assume important role in
							world affairs.'” The opposition Civil Rule Party and Democratic Party
							accepted the outcome and hoped that the Korean troops would contribute
							to uniting the nations of the free world and to bringing peace and
							stability to the region. (Telegram 678 from Seoul, January 27;
							ibid.)</p>
                        <p>After the National Assembly approved the dispatch of additional troops,
							the Korean and United States Governments concentrated on the issue of
							the rate and method to be used to pay allowances to the Korean military
							personnel serving in Vietnam. In late February the United States acceded
							to a Korean demand for payment to be made to the Korean Government with
							an unvouchered cash grant to be disbursed in dollars to Korean troops.
							Although the United States urged that payment be limited to an allowance
							of one dollar per day per man, the Koreans rejected that amount as
							conflicting with previous promises made to the troops and as
							inappropriate for higher-ranking men and officers. (Telegram 768 to
							Seoul, February 18; ibid., DEF 19 US–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Korean officials agreed with the United States request to do
							everything possible to prevent disclosing that funding originated in the
							United States. The United States also agreed to assume all costs for the
							medical and tae-kwon-do units already in Vietnam. (Telegram 799 to
							Seoul, February 27; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> has considered various implications
							of cuts in US forces Korea which we understand are impending, for
							implementation between now and June 30, 1965. Our information stems from
								<gloss target="#t_DA1">DA</gloss> instructions received by COMUS
							Korea which indicate decision has been taken to subtract 9,000 spaces
							from present authorized strength of 8th US Army amounting to 51,000. The
							decision is reportedly based on balance-of-payments considerations.<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">Reduction of forces in Korea was part of an
								effort to reduce U.S. military expenditures around the world, except
								in Vietnam, and improve the U.S. balance-of-payments position by
								maintaining overseas military forces at the September 30, 1964,
								level. Additional documentation on proposed reductions in Korea is
								ibid.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Cut of this magnitude represents reduction of about 18 percent in
							level of US Army Forces in Korea. This reduction in numbers of personnel
							would be likely sooner or later to attract public attention and give
							rise to rumors that US forces are “pulling out” of Korea. By the same
							token it would be virtually impossible to conceal fact and extent of
							reductions from <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. If we attempt to
							do this we are almost certain to fail, and to be accursed of bad faith
							by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. If, on the other hand, we
							inform <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> at outset, result likely to
							be immediate leaks to press and National Assembly setting off widespread
							alarm that US is withdrawing its forces from Korea in anticipation of
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement. It goes
							without saying that such a furor at this time would jeopardize prospect
							for successful conclusion that settlement which we have been expecting
							after so long this spring. As Dept aware, one of <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0094"/>chief fruits <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> seeking from forthcoming Washington visit President
							Pak is assurance that present US force levels will be maintained (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 861).<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">In telegram 861 from Seoul, March 12, the Embassy outlined the
								subjects Pak wanted to discuss during his Washington visit. With
								regard to Korea's security, Pak wanted to maintain U.S. and Korean
								force levels, increase <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds,
								and modernize Korean military equipment. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Minister of National Defense had also raised the
								issue of maintaining U.S. force levels in Korea during the
								negotiations in January on sending Korean forces to Vietnam.
								(Telegram 621 to Seoul, January 18, and telegram 658 from Seoul,

							commitment to Korea to help win public support for Korea-Japan
							settlement.</p>
                        <p>3. As indicated in previous para, failure on our part to give prior
							notification to ROKG of impending cut would give rise to accusation we
							not complying faithfully with our stated intention to consult with
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> on this question. Most
							explicit assurance on this point was given personally by Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to President Pak at their
							meeting in January 1964 when Secretary said force reduction was not a
							current problem and US approach would be to examine question later on in
							consultation with Korean Govt (93540, para 32, Jan 31, 1964).<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4">Not found, but telegram <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> 60079 from CINCUNC, January 31, 1964, contains
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s comments to Pak on
								the question of force reduction. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The joint
								communique released at the conclusion of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s visit also addressed the issue; see <ref target="#d3fn4">footnote 4, Document 3</ref>.</note> Whether or
							not our recommendation given below that cut be postponed is accepted we
							believe that we must honor this commitment, at least by going through
							motions of consultation.</p>
                        <p>4. However, now is not a good time to hold such consultations. It would
							spoil the atmosphere which both we and the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> hope to generate for President Pak's forthcoming visit
							to Washington and for the successful conclusion Korean-Japan talks. A
							settlement with Japan is almost within grasp; the outcome will be known,
							probably with certainty, before June 30. We believe that this
							accomplishment which for years has been a paramount objective of US
							policy in East Asia is so vitally related to the US national interest
							that the balance of payments savings which would accrue from the
							contemplated reduction over the next few months can and should be
							foregone until the outcome of the current negotiations is decided one
							way or the other.</p>
                        <p>5. Our rough estimate is that the reduction contemplated might reduce
							total US military spending in Korea by somewhere between $5 million and
							$10 million annually depending on how the reductions are carried out.
								<gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> does not deprecate the
							contribution this reduction in spending would make to a solution of our
							balance of payments problem, although doubting that it will be entirely
							a net gain to US in view US position as residual supporter of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> balance of payments. Meeting <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0095"/>high priority US objectives for Korean
							economic development may require additional offsetting supporting
							assistance.</p>
                        <p>6. Ideally, as set forth in agreed language of draft national policy

								“Factors Bearing on U.S. Policy,” August 1965, is in the National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, S/P Files: Lot 72 D 139,
								Country Files.</note> we believe no reductions in either <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> or US forces should be considered until
							after Korea-Japan normalization. In accordance with that carefully
							thought out recommendation we strongly urge that any reduction in US
							Forces Korea be postponed until a suitable period after a settlement
							with Japan is reached this year. If a settlement is reached, say by June
							1, our judgment is that a period of at least six months should be
							allowed for the dust of that action, and its ratification by the
							National Assembly, to settle. Consultations with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> on reduction of US Forces could then

							visited Washington March 15–17, 1965. He met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on March 15 to discuss current
							Korean problems, including the situation in Vietnam, the Korea-Japan
							settlement, North Korea, the pending Status of Forces Agreement,
							economic matters, and similar issues. On March 16 the Foreign Minister
							met separately with Vice President Humphrey, Assistant Secretary of
							State for Far Eastern Affairs <persName>Bundy</persName>, and Secretary
							of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, with whom
							many of the same issues were discussed, particularly Vietnam and the

								ROK COMBAT DIVISION FOR BASE SECURITY DUTY IN SOUTH VIETNAM</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. We do not believe that the introduction of one <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat division into South Vietnam for static defense
							purposes would provoke Communist China, North Korea, or North Vietnam
							overtly to invade South Korea or South Vietnam. Neither do we believe
							that it would in itself change Communist attitudes toward negotiations,
							or lead to a slackening of the insurrection in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. The main question is what interpretation the Communists would put on
							the introduction of the full <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat
							division. They would almost certainly estimate that it would not in
							itself significantly alter the military situation. They might consider,
							however, that it portended a substantial further buildup of foreign
							forces—e.g., Chinese Nationalist, Thai, Philippine, and US—for ground
							combat. Whatever their estimate on this point, they would try to
							discourage such a buildup. To this end they would increase their
							propaganda, and again accuse the US of recklessly expanding the war.
							They would probably <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0097"/>employ the
							theme of “US use of Asians to fight Asians” and attempt to stir up
							troubles between the ROK forces and the Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>3. The Communists would probably supplement their propaganda with some
							sorts of action. The North Koreans would almost certainly attempt to
							arouse protests in South Korea against the export of South Korean
							forces. They might make threatening military movement within North Korea
							or along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, designed to reinforce
							any doubts the South Korean or other governments might have about the
							wisdom of thus diverting their troops. We think it unlikely that North
							Korean ground force “volunteers” would be sent to North Vietnam, though
							it is possible that North Korean technicians or anti-aircraft personnel
							(possibly SAM operators) might be brought in. In South Vietnam, Viet
							Cong terrorist efforts and military harassment might be directed against
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in the hope that
							casualties would cause discontent in South Korea and also serve as a
							warning to other potential foreign contingents.</p>
                        <p>4. Communist China might attempt to scare off further US-initiated
							strengthening moves in South Vietnam by deploying Chinese forces
							southward toward the North Vietnam border. We do not believe, however,
							that China would do much else. It would be unlikely to counter by
							sending a Chinese division to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
							because it would be unneeded there and probably uninvited. If it had
							decided for independent reasons, to send more or less overt
							anti-aircraft or fighter plane units, it might seize upon the
							introduction of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division in the
							South as further justification for doing so.</p>
                        <p>5. The introduction of a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division
							would add one more complication to an already difficult situation for
							Moscow. It would provide a new occasion for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to put pressure on the USSR for more and quicker
							military aid. The USSR might agree to North Vietnamese requests for
							greater or speedier assistance, although we doubt that this would take
							forms which substantially increased the risks of direct Soviet
							involvement. It would also diminish somewhat any USSR hopes that
							negotiations could still be arranged.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bob:</p>
                        <p>I am writing about our protracted negotiations with Korea and the
							Republic of China concerning status of forces arrangements for those
							countries. In each case, the negotiation is now centered upon the
							difficult and sensitive issue of criminal jurisdiction over our forces.
							Given the importance attached to the negotiations in these two
							countries, and the prolonged delay in reaching agreement, I believe that
							the way in which we now handle the criminal jurisdiction issue will have
							a significant bearing on our future political relationship with both
								governments.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Additional documentation on
								the criminal jurisdiction issue is in the National Archives and
								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 15–3 KOR
									<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-US.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our present position accepts in each case that the host government will
							have discretion to exercise some criminal jurisdiction over our
							personnel. We have designed our proposals, however, to take account of
							certain inadequacies in the local systems of judicial administration.
							First, we have insisted that our exposure to local jurisdiction be
							sharply reduced from the outset. We have demanded that these governments
							waive their primary jurisdiction in advance and agree that this waiver
							can be recalled (and their jurisdiction exercised) only in cases of
							major importance arising from certain types of offenses. Secondly, we
							are insisting on a variety of protections for those cases in which their
							jurisdiction might ultimately come to be exercised. These include an
							extensive list of fair trial guarantees, the presence of our trained
							observers at all proceedings, and U.S. custody of the accused throughout
							all proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Neither the Koreans nor the Chinese regard our proposals as reasonable,
							or as really consistent with their sovereignty. Both are clearly
							concerned that their acquiescence in these arrangements would not be
							defensible against internal or external criticism. The Koreans have
							rejected the waiver arrangement, although they have shown flexibility on
							the procedural safeguards and custody. The Chinese have accepted the
							waiver proposal (which gives them greater latitude than in the Korean
							case for recall of the waiver), but they have done so with obviously
							great reluctance and diffidence, and only subject to our making <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0099"/>concessions in the important area
							of U.S. custody. The Chinese have told us that in their view they are
							being offered a composite of the worst of our status of forces and base
							rights arrangements world-wide.</p>
                        <p>Considering the long delay in reaching mutually satisfactory agreements
							with the Koreans and Chinese, and their reactions to our proposals, I
							have felt compelled to re-examine our position on the criminal
							jurisdiction issue. I certainly do not question that any formula we
							agree upon must offer adequate protection for our personnel. However, I
							think we should be careful not to overlook any more negotiable
							alternatives which would also provide such protection. I am particularly
							anxious to find an alternative because I do not believe our present
							position (even if it could be negotiated by some further application of
							pressure) would be politically viable. On the contrary, I believe it
							would leave a considerable residue of political bitterness affecting our
							broader national interests in these two countries. I have no doubt that
							the effects would be notable in the implementation of the status of
							forces agreements themselves. For example, we could expect to find both
							governments determined to exercise the full limit of the restricted
							jurisdiction available to them, rather than disposed to leave any of
							these cases in our hands.</p>
                        <p>I am convinced that in the circumstances we should propose to these two
							countries the same waiver formula we use in the Federal Republic of
							Germany. The effect would be to make illustrative, rather than
							definitive, the list of offenses in which the host government could
							exercise jurisdiction. However, the host government would still be bound
							by rigorous criteria in electing to exercise its jurisdiction. For
							example, it would still be necessary that the host country's exercise of
							jurisdiction be required by major interests arising out of the special
							circumstances of a specific case. We would feel justified to intercede
							through diplomatic channels if the propriety of the host state's action
							under this stringent criterion were questionable. In respect of
							jurisdiction actually exercised by these two governments, the accused
							would be afforded the protection of those fair trial guarantees we
							consider necessary and a U.S. observer would be present during the trial
							proceedings. The U.S. would retain custody of the accused throughout all
							judicial proceedings and would not surrender the accused in any case
							where the accused had not been accorded a fair trial. On this basis, I
							feel that the so-called “German formula” would adequately provide for
							the protection of our personnel.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the German formula would be negotiable with the Chinese
							and Koreans, and without establishing a residue of resentment and
							noncooperation, because it is in force with a major European ally and is
							appropriate to their forward-area location. Its justifiability on these
							grounds will be of great importance if our current discussions of <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0100"/>criminal jurisdiction with the
							Philippines should produce an agreement there. In the Philippines, for a
							variety of reasons, we have proposed a formula which is much more
							favorable to the host state, and we will be pleased if we can get it. We
							must of course anticipate that there will be disparity between the
							Philippine settlement on the one hand, and the Chinese and Korean
							arrangements on the other. I believe this can be managed if the latter
							arrangements involve the German formula, because it can be justified by
							precedent and on the merits. If the disparity were to be greater, as our
							present position would make it, I can only anticipate that our
							difficulties with the Chinese and Koreans will be exacerbated
							sharply.</p>
                        <p>At this writing, we are uncertain how fast the Philippine negotiations
							will proceed, but there is some indication today that they may move
							rapidly. If so, this would compound the problem with the Chinese and
							Koreans. But that problem would exist in any case, even if the
							Philippine negotiations were delayed, as there is the greatest possible
							evidence that the Chinese and Koreans have been watching closely the
							progress in each other's negotiations, and that both are well aware of
							the Philippine aspect.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore appreciate it if you could concur in our working out
							new instructions to Seoul and Taipei, embodying the German waiver
							formula.</p>
                        <p>With warm regards,</p>

                        <p>1. Proposal to dispatch <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat
							division to Vietnam in present circumstances would present problem and
							involve consideration quite different from those surrounding dispatch of
							non-combat units. It involves <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0101"/>factors which have probably not been fully presented to or even
							considered by Foreign Minister Lee Tong-won.</p>
                        <p>2. Sending <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division to Vietnam would
							require approval of National Assembly and wide and free-ranging public
							discussion at a time when <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is
							engaged in major struggle in effort to normalize relations with Japan.
							This struggle likely to continue for at least two months and possibly
							longer. It may involve very survival of the government in face of
							determined opposition effort to create turmoil. We can say with
							certainty based on recent experience that this proposal would arouse
							strong objections and require great deal of attention from a govt
							already harassed.</p>
                        <p>3. Opposition politicians vigorously opposed dispatch of 2,000 non-combat
							troops to Vietnam. Their opposition to this new proposal will be even
							stronger. Opposition press can be counted on to oppose and to introduce
							strong element of doubt about wisdom of greater Korean participation in
							Vietnam. This has already begun in comments on news report from
							Washington of FonMin's reported offer to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> of further troops. Students, who
							were not on campus at time of National Assembly debate over <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_IMAF1">IMAF</gloss> last January, will interject
							themselves and at least a vociferous minority among them is likely to
							oppose. Hue and cry will bewilder general public and generate uneasiness
							and fear of consequences of greater Korean participation in distant
							undeclared war when known enemy is nearby and their own daily problems
							appear so difficult. Adding controversy over this issue to other current
							controversies would weaken government at time when maximum strength is
							needed for ratification ROK-Japan agreement. Reservations about troop
							dispatch expressed previously by elements in DRP will be stronger and
							thus make it more difficult for govt to obtain National Assembly
							approval for the settlement by simple exercise of its majority.</p>
                        <p>4. Top leadership of govt feels greater readiness to expand Korea's
							contribution than any other sector of Korean society. President Pak,
							some Cabinet officers, and majority of military leadership are bold in
							vision and want <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to play greater role
							in East Asia. They would in normal circumstances probably be quite
							prepared to act provided their conditions were satisfied. Nevertheless,
							we believe even this leadership would hesitate to take on task of
							sending combat division to Vietnam at this time. Their plate is full and
							before any more is added at least <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan issue must be out of way.</p>
                        <p>5. We therefore conclude time is not now propitious.</p>
                        <p>6. It would moreover in our judgment be undesirable to take up question
							with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> before or during Pak visit to
							Washington if, as now seems likely, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement not yet ratified and visit viewed
							primarily as aid to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in getting
							ratification. In addition to certainty <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0102"/>that proposal would lead to press, problem of
							negotiating suitable package for Pak on that occasion would be greatly
							complicated by US request for combat troops, especially since if request
							were made initial response would probably be affirmative but be followed
							immediately by second thoughts and stipulation of long list of
							conditions on points covered below. We recognize that it might seem
							strange if request were presented to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> soon after Pak returned without having been discussed
							during Washington visit. Nevertheless, on balance we think it better to
							defer raising matter with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> until
							after ratification, recognizing that Washington's judgment on this will
							be made in light of relative importance attached in short term to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement on one hand and
							reenforcement in Vietnam on other. If by chance ratification already in
							hand, Pak visit would be logical time to raise matter with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. In more normal political situation that is likely to obtain after
							ratification of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement,
							our present judgment is that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, as
							distinguished from public, would wish to respond affirmatively to US
							request for combat division for Vietnam. We expect govt's position will
							be strengthened by successful conclusion Japanese settlement, although
							immediate aftermath will probably see Cabinet shakeup. Koreans remain
							fundamentally anti-Communist, with some pride in their willingness to
							stand at side of a country threatened by common enemy. It is not
							difficult for Koreans to recognize enemy even when he is distant and
							they do remember being helped in their own adversity. Many volunteers
							among veterans of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army are ready to
							come forward, partly from a spirit of adventure and partly in hope of
							useful employment and financial gain. Even after ratification opposition
							would still oppose, as they did last January, and there would be
							nationwide discussion and debate, but with assurances and help from US
							(extent of these would be vitally important), proper preparation of
							public opinion, and good management, govt would stand sufficient chance
							of getting National Assembly approval to justify the effort.</p>
                        <p>8. In official and public consideration this action, there would be
							concern over possibility of greater danger along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, where status quo would appear subject to change with
							Korean engagement in open conflict against Communist elements elsewhere.
							We agree with Dept's estimate that chances of all-out conflict on border
							between North and South Korea are not great. We do not exclude
							possibility of North Korean demonstration along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> (e.g. more fire fights, artillery fire on Paeng Yan-do
							or even large scale bombardment) to generate fear, inspire movement of
							refugees, etc. Whether danger is actually greater or not, many Koreans
							would raise question whether their country's actions in Vietnam might
							not endanger their own country's peace.</p>
                        <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>9. There would be some concern over legality sending combat troops to
							Vietnam in absence treaty obligation. This was raised by opposition and
							some newspapers during debate over sending non-combat troops and can be
							expected to be repeated with call for some form of formal treaty
							relationship which would sanction such intervention.</p>
                        <p>10. Many Koreans would question their ability share burden of collective
							security when their own problems are great and their progress is slow.
							They would question need for greater Korean role, when other free
							nations in Asia have not yet made contribution equivalent to their own.
							This questioning would be directed particularly at Japan's failure to
							help, at the wisdom of sterilizing the Chinese nationalists, at slowness
							of Philippines to act, and at the relatively modest contributions of
							Australia and New Zealand. Some responsible Korean military figures
							might question publicly (as they already have privately, e.g. commander
							of advance party for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_IMAF1">IMAF</gloss> and General <persName corresp="#p_KCOKCO1">Kim Chong-O</persName>) feasibility of
							employing Korean combat units in guerrilla war in foreign environment,
							under difficult tactical and logistical conditions.</p>
                        <p>11. Material aspects will loom large in Korean calculations, both
							official and private. Persuasion and appeals to rally to common cause
							will be useful, but special inducements on large scale will be
							necessary. Pressure will not work and should not be attempted. Volunteer
							aspect would need to be stressed to minimize complaints that comscripts
							being sent abroad to fight in undeclared war.</p>
                        <p>12. ROKG would seek firm assurances US forces in Korea would not be
							reduced and revision of US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Mutual
							Security Treaty to secure US commitment along lines <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> formula as insurance against any
							increase in threat from North. Any proposal that one US division be
							shifted from Korea as part of build-up in Vietnam would be vigorously
							opposed and would increase effectiveness of opposition arguments that
							Korean interests were being sacrificed.</p>
                        <p>13. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would expect all expenses of
							operation to be borne by US. This would include transportation,
							logistical requirements, special overseas allowances, and any other cost
							factors involved. For force of say 21,000 men this would be substantial
							amount. ROKG will almost certainly ask that division sent to Vietnam be
							replaced as soon as possible by activating a new division at US
							expense.</p>
                        <p>14. To bolster their defenses against what they would consider as
							substantially increased risk to their own security, <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would vigorously seek more military
							support to fill budgetary and military deficiencies, including
							suspension <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer, increased
							military budget support, and expanded <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> levels. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would
							expect to get substantial benefit from sale of goods to Vietnam under US
							aid financed program, and from maintenance and repair services which <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0104"/>Korea can supply. This subject
							has been getting considerable attention in <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> ever since their troops went to Vietnam. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would also expect its active role in
							Vietnam to be reflected in US economic aid levels in Korea. Their
							argument would be such—if Korea is to help abroad it needs to be
							strengthened internally. It is not yet ready to bear extra burdens.</p>
                        <p>15. To sum up, we see formidable proposal [opposition?] and long
							drawn-out debate over proposal. Present time is particularly difficult,
							but under any foreseeable circumstances govt will have trouble and
							public opinion is certain to be divided. Extensive inducements will be
							required and cost will be great. But if approached after <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan ratification and with assurances
							of generous support from US, our present best judgment is that govt
							response is likely to be affirmative. National Assembly approval can be
							hoped for but cannot be assured.</p>
                        <p>16. We believe that question also has implications for the long-run
							psychology of US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relationship which
							we are examining and which may affect judgments expressed above pro or
							contra. For example public debate of this question may give Koreans
							greater feeling of equality and partnership with the US, helping to
							compensate for age-old inferiority complex and fear of Japan, and
							contribute to a new sense of national confidence. On other hand, many
							Koreans may begin to question whether US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relationship evolving into one in which <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> becomes tool which US uses for own
							political and strategic purposes instead of independent object of US
							assistance and support. These possible effects involve larger question
							of how both we and Koreans envisage not only their relationship with the
							US but their own changing role in Asia and the speed of that
							transition.</p>

                                <ref target="#d36">Document 36</ref>.</note> for the Chinese and

                        </p>
                        <p>The issue is the extent to which the host states would have the option to
							exercise criminal jurisdiction over US personnel. Everyone <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0106"/>is agreed that the US would have
							jurisdiction over official duty offenses and those involving only US
							personnel or property. In the remaining cases, the Services and the
							Joint Chiefs of Staff want to continue to press for limiting the host
							state's option to exercise jurisdiction to definitive categories of
							cases (e.g. rape, death of a human being and robbery). They are
							concerned by reports of corruption, bribery and political influence
							which, in their judgment, may have an impact that would not be readily
							detectable by US observers in the administration of justice by the
							courts of these countries. Through the definitive categories formula,
							they hope to reduce the exposure of US personnel to the local courts.
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believes that the
							definitive categories formula is not negotiable since it is without
							precedent and that, in any case, it is not necessary. He recommends we
							offer instead the jurisdiction formula in effect with the Federal
							Republic of Germany. Under this formula, the host state is not limited
							to specific categories of cases. However, before the Chinese or Korean
							authorities could exercise jurisdiction in a given case, they would have
							to determine that the particular circumstances of that case make their
							exercise of jurisdiction imperative. This stringent criterion would in
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s judgment limit
							the number of cases in which the host states would exercise
							jurisdiction. (The memorandum at Tab F from the Acting General Counsel
							discusses both sides of the issue in greater detail.)</p>
                        <p>The difference in positions is basically one of degree and approach. No
							one contends that we must not accept some local exercise of jurisdiction
							over US personnel. It is a matter of judgment as to which formula is
							negotiable and which, if accepted, would work better over the longer
							term. The Acting General Counsel considers that either formula is
							acceptable from a legal point of view.</p>
                        <p>Given all the circumstances, I believe that the totality of the
							safeguards incorporated in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s proposal is adequate to protect our personnel.
							The <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> proposal would require
							Korea and China to accept a far less favorable arrangement than we have
							offered to the Philippines. I share his judgment that the German formula
							is a reasonable solution to a difficult problem and that to continue to
							press for the definitive categories formula would jeopardize our present
							excellent relationships without any appreciable increase in protection
							for our personnel.</p>
                        <p>If you approve Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
							proposal, I will notify the Services and the Chairman of the Joint
							Chiefs of Staff and have appropriate instructions sent to Seoul and

							nevertheless transmitted in order to stress importance in Korea of
							really substantial contributions by other countries, and in the hope
							that at least some of the considerations set forth therein may be
							helpful to Ambassador Lodge in his efforts to secure same.</p>
                        <p>1. Following are further thoughts referred to in last para <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 931.<note n="3" xml:id="d39fn3">
                                <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The basic danger to be averted if possible lies deeper than the
							immediate questions of whether <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							will respond affirmatively to a request and the extent of political
							difficulties in National Assembly. It is the risk of creating a
							situation in which Korea appears to its own people and to others in the
							world not as an independent and willing contributor to a struggle in
							which it has a vital interest, but as a puppet or vassal of the US,
							brought into danger in distant Southeast Asia and at home to serve the
							interests of the US. If Korea is the only country besides the US which
							sends significant combat units to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
							such an impression can be created. It certainly will be fostered and
							exploited to the utmost by the opposition here and if established will
							corrode US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relationship.</p>
                        <p>3. Despite forthcoming attitude of President Pak and other leaders,
							Koreans generally are not yet psychologically prepared play large role
							on international stage. Conscious of economic and political weakness
							Koreans are preoccupied with proximate interests, e.g. normalization
							with Japan, unification, and with domestic problems. Country is divided,
							government is still weak and economy requires large scale external aid.
							Living under shadow of two most powerful Communist countries, its
							relations with nearest free world neighbor (Japan) are just, with
							difficulty, being restored to normal. With other free world and neutral
							nations, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has problem maintaining and
							extending recognition <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0108"/>as only
							legitimate government in Korea. Thus by ordinary standards <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in no position to play important
							international role or to give economic or military assistance.</p>
                        <p>4. Relations with <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> countries (<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> itself, Thailand, Philippines and
							Malaysia) are friendly enough, and Thai and Filipino troops fought in
							Korean War. Except for thin layer of leadership in govt, however,
							Koreans do not think of themselves as heavily involved in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> problems by virtue of either political
							or economic interests there.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s traditional anti-communism,
							the immense stake of all Asia, including Korea in free world success in
								<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, Korea's special relationship
							with US and existence of large and powerful <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military force in being, all constitute persuasive
							arguments for invoking <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> assistance.
							But strength of these arguments is diluted so long as US <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners remain aloof, and Asian
							allies much closer to scene, much further from enemy and with more
							obviously direct interest in SE Asia, e.g. Thailand and Philippines, do
							not send combat troops in any substantial number. Moreover, mission
							Korean forces in Korean eyes is to defend <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and if not needed for that purpose, many Koreans would
							wish to see force reduced. Force is not now adequately <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> supported and pay and allowances are
							heavy drain on limited budgetary resources which will be increasingly
							needed for local costs of economic development program. On other hand
							existence of unemployment on large scale in ROK will pre-dispose many in
							favor of sending volunteers to fight in Vietnam. This feeling especially
							strong among veterans. A division of volunteers would create far less
							domestic political difficulty, but would of course take much longer to
							activate and make ready.</p>
                        <p>6. These considerations emphasize importance of substantial contribution
							of forces by other countries to counteract impression ROK forces being
							used as mercenaries to fight US war in SE Asia. We recognize that Japan
							is not expected to contribute forces at this time, but reasons are not
							appreciated in ROK. A substantial economic contribution from Japan for
							Vietnam would at least help to lessen objections in Korea that other
							Asian countries not making proportionate sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally, strong and stable Korea is important anchor for our security
							interests in Far East. Our concern is whether those interests will be
							best served by contributions of manpower in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, if that contribution adds to instability and weakness
							here. Chief domestic political task for present <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is to build public confidence which it now lacks.
							Before sending even volunteers to fight in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, it ought to be sure of broad measure of public support
							over and above majority party approval in National Assembly. Externally
							chief task is to ensure normalization results in successful <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan relationship. Active role of
							Korean military in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> might well have
							adverse impact upon developing <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>relations with Japan. We would value Amb <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName>'s judgment on this question.</p>
                        <p>8. Foregoing is submitted for consideration by Washington, along with the
							many other relevant factors of which we cannot have adequate
							understanding, in making decision whether to ask <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to provide combat troops for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and as possibly useful background for Ambassador Lodge
							on his trip.”</p>

								division (18,000 men) in later stage if required,” although the
								Koreans were not to be informed of that possibility at present.
								(Telegram 1040 to Seoul, April 26; ibid.) The Embassy responded in
								telegram 1072, April 26, that, because the National Assembly would
								have to approve the dispatch of additional troops, Pak should be
								informed from the start so that he could decide whether to “seek

								rather than tackle problem piecemeal.” (Ibid.)</note> We appreciate

                        <p>Basic factor is, as stated in our 1039,<note n="3" xml:id="d40fn3">Telegram 1039 to Seoul, also sent to Tokyo as telegram 2745, April
								25, outlined the approach Lodge should take in his meeting with Pak

								there may arise a possibility that a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat contribution on the order of a regimental
								combat team (about 4,000 men) would become desirable within the next
								two months.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–14
									KOREA/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>)</note> that we are most
							anxious avoid any publicity for deployments before they are firmly
							agreed with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and preferably before
							they actually arrive. We realize that in case of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> units alerting and shipping arrangements alone would
							probably lead to necessity for announcement well prior to arrival, and
							it is for this reason, in part, that we did not visualize <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>, even if fully agreed, closing

                        <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0110"/>
                        <p>Secondly, if we do go through with proposed additional 2–3 enclaves, we
							are most anxious to have this appear—as indeed is the fact—as a limited
							measure to secure particular areas and conduct limited operations from
							them. Any foreshadowing of much greater deployments to come would jump
							the gun in view of the very tentative character of our thinking at this
							point, and would inevitably create the impression that we were simply
							moving inexorably to a large ground involvement. Obviously, if Pak were
							to seek Assembly approval for a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							division, even if he made it clear that it would not be dispatched
							immediately in toto, it would inevitably lead to conclusion by press and
							other governments that if ROK was considering a force of this size we
							ourselves must have in mind something very much greater.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons it seems to us vital that Pak not seek any Assembly
							approval for a division at least before the end of June and probably not
							until we have had a much better chance to evaluate effectiveness of more
							limited deployments now contemplated. It also seems to us, unless you
							can be really sure of security factor, that it would be most risky to
							tell him firmly that we even have in mind the possibility of a
							division-size ROK combat contribution. If it is humanly possible, we
							must take this thing one bite at a time in order to avoid most serious
							consequences in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and in world
							attitudes.</p>
                        <p>We suppose that part of your problem is that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Assembly may recess during summer. We wonder, however,
							if it could not be recalled if required.</p>
                        <p>Hence, we would vastly prefer you stick to original instructions while
							not foreclosing possibility additional contribution might later be
							requested. Please handle accordingly unless you have reply comments.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, any publicity even for <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss>
							proposal at this time would be most inopportune. We do not have <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> reaction to any additional deployments
							and would need to work out details even when and if both <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and Pak are agreeable in principle.
							Moreover, exact timing of any public indication—much less formal seeking
							Assembly approval—will have to be weighed very carefully in total
							picture of public impact added deployments. Hence, you should make
							perfectly clear to Pak that we would need to consult very closely with
							him on future handling and that all publicity must be avoided for
							now.</p>

                        <p>1082. Following is draft memo of private conversation between Amb Lodge
							and President Pak, which has not been cleared by Amb Lodge. This
							followed more general discussion being separately reported.<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">A summary of Lodge's general discussion of Vietnam
								with Pak and other high-level Korean officials was transmitted in
								telegram 1085 from Seoul, April 28. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/LODGE) Additional documentation on the Lodge
								visit to Seoul is ibid. and POL 27–3 VIET S.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Amb Lodge said that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> wants President Pak to know, for his personal
							ears only, that an appraisal of the situation in South Viet Nam
							indicated that it might be necessary to introduce additional troops. The
							possibility of asking Korea to contribute a regimental combat team of
							perhaps 4,000 men was being discussed with PriMin Quat. No conclusions
							had yet been reached. Hence the Amb was not making any specific request,
							but he did want President Pak to know that such a request might be
							forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>2. The President said that any request for further assistance from Korea
							would be given very serious consideration. He could assure Amb Lodge
							that Korea would do what it could to help.</p>
                        <p>3. The President said that the Korean Amb in Saigon (Sin Xang-ch'ol) was
							concerned that there were not sufficient combat troops in South Viet Nam
							adequately to protect the 2,000 non-combat troops which had been sent
								there.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">The Embassy in Saigon was puzzled
								by Pak's claim and noted that Korean forces included an infantry
								battalion and a company of marines, were stationed in a relatively
								secure area close to U.S. and Vietnamese air bases, and had
								reinforced their installations with sandbags and trenches. (Telegram
								3607 from Saigon, May 1; ibid.)</note> This was a matter which had
							been under consideration by his govt. There had been opposition in some
							quarters to the dispatch of the 2,000 non-combat troops to South Viet
							Nam. Some of this came from people who were ignorant, some from people
							who were dubious about the policies being pursued in Viet Nam, and some
							was just political opposition. All of these matters would have to be
							considered, and also questions on timing. The President would consider
							them and would continue the discussion of this question with Amb
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. Amb Lodge said we very much appreciated President Pak's forthright
							response to his remarks, and that Amb <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> would be in <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0112"/>touch with the President when the matter had been further considered
							in Saigon and Washington. He stressed the importance that no word of
							this suggestion should get out to the public because of the obvious
							embarrassment that would be caused to all concerned in Saigon, Seoul,
							Washington, and in any other countries that might contribute, by
							premature disclosure. The President said he fully appreciated the
							necessity for secrecy.</p>
                        <p>5. The President then said that he wished to mention the matter of the
							settlement with Japan. He asked Amb Lodge to assure President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> that the Korean Govt was
							determined to complete the settlement with Japan. There would be
							opposition. There would probably be further demonstrations. There would
							be difficulty in the Assembly. But the President was convinced that the
							majority of the Korean people supported that settlement and that the
							govt would be able to secure its ratification. He said that he had hoped
							that the agreement would be signed before he left for Washington.
							Practical considerations of drafting, etc., however, made this very
							difficult. He thought now that it probably would be signed by the end of
							May, perhaps when he came back. The agreement might be submitted to the
							Assembly at the end of June or early July when, he said, with a smile,
							it was very hot and people would be less inclined to protracted debate
							and struggle.</p>
                        <p>6. The President closed by asking Amb Lodge to assure President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> that he was in full support of
							President Johnson's policies and that he intended to tell President
							Johnson personally when he saw him in Washington.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> called on the
							Minister of National Defense at the latter's request to clarify
							Washington attitudes toward various requests for assistance previously
							made by the Minister. Minister Kim opened the conversation by asking
							what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> had heard
							from Washington.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> said that he
							now had a reply from Washington covering the four main points raised by
							Minister Kim.<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> and Kim met on April 29
								and discussed military issues in preparation for Pak's visit to
								Washington. (Memorandum of conversation attached to airgram A–551;
								ibid.)</note> Washington's position was along the lines Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> had expected and had
							warned Minister Kim to expect.</p>
                        <p>3. On measures to expand trade with South Vietnam, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> said the U.S. Government would be
							as helpful as possible consistent with the requirements of established
							policy. This meant that favorable consideration would be given to
							procurement of goods and services from Korea under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
							funded programs where Korean suppliers were competitive as to price,
							quality and delivery terms, etc. Thus the door is open to Korean
							suppliers. It was our belief that there are many good opportunities and
							markets and that Korean suppliers are in a good competitive position.
							The Ambassador pointed out that Saigon is the best place to work out
							specific transactions, not only for goods, but for repair and service
							contracts as well. The Ambassador stressed that “buy American”
							limitations would continue to obtain for many commodities, and that in
							the case of other commodities which were open to “limited free world”
							procurement, Korea could not be given a preferential position.</p>
                        <p>4. With regard to the level of U.S. forces in Korea, as the Ambassador
							had previously explained, the U.S. cannot undertake to make a precise,
							open-ended commitment. We are prepared to say in the communique, to be
							issued in Washington on the occasion of President Pak's visit to the
							United States, that we have assured President Pak that the U.S. will
							continue to maintain powerful forces, which in conjunction with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, would be sufficient to ensure
							the security of the Republic of Korea. However, we cannot say that we
							will keep any specific number of troops for any specific period of time.
							Nor can we make the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-type
							undertaking that an attack on the Republic of Korea would be regarded as
							an attack on the United States. We are prepared, however, in the
							communique to reaffirm the U.S. intention <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0114"/>to come to the defense of Korea in the event of an
							attack in accordance with the treaty of 1953.</p>
                        <p>5. The Ambassador told Minister Kim that he had not been able to change
							the Washington position on the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							transfer.</p>
                        <p>6. As to the military assistance program, again Washington could not
							commit specific amounts for specific times. The communique could say
							that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> would be continued and that the
							U.S. would do its best to provide <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							assistance in amounts necessary to ensure effective Korean forces. The
							communique would also say that a substantial portion of won counterpart
							funds would be available for the defense budget if that would be
							helpful.</p>
                        <p>7. The Ambassador then referred to the request for assistance made by the
							Minister of National Defense earlier (see Memcon dated April 29, 1965)
							for a military pay raise.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3"> Kim sought a 75
								percent pay increase, which represented $30 million. (Ibid.)</note>
							He said that we regarded this as a complicated and difficult question,
							especially since it involved the possibility of pay adjustments for
							other government employees. We recognized the need for pay adjustments
							but we wanted to make sure a solution was found which would be complete
							and at the same time not inflationary. Washington too was sympathetic
							but had suggested that we sit down here in Seoul with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, especially with the Economic
							Planning Ministry, to work out all of the details of the problem and try
							to find a solution. The Ambassador said to Minister Kim that he may have
							felt that a firm position on this question was lacking on the U.S. side.
							However, he had discussed the matter at length with General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> and Mr. Bernstein and we were
							prepared to assist in finding a solution if the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> (not just the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>)
							would work out a government program.</p>
                        <p>8. Minister Kim was openly dejected after the Ambassador's recital. He
							remarked ruefully that if he could not get some relief on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer, he would have to stay in the
							United States; that he could not come back to Korea. Minister Kim went
							on to explain that the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer had
							become a grave political issue and that, more than anything else, the
							people were expecting that President Pak would come back from Washington
							with some adjustment in the transfer program.</p>
                        <p>9. The Ambassador asked what had led the Korean people to such a state of
							mind and Minister Kim understood the inference. He said he was aware
							that he is sometimes known as the world champion preventer of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer. This was because the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer led to an increased military
							budget. When he had to ask for more money for the military budget,
							journalists and editors became attentive and wanted to know why. It was
							difficult to get more money for the defense <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0115"/>budget and therefore he must fight against anything
							that increases that budget. The Minister of National Defense must
							provide for the armed forces. The armed forces expect this of him. (The
							Minister implied at this point that the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer would make it more difficult to obtain funds
							for a military pay raise and he was therefore under pressure from the
							senior officers to resist the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							transfer program.)</p>
                        <p>10. The Minister said that the pay raise problem was very serious but
							that the Korean Government has other serious problems. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials outside the Defense
							Ministry look with disfavor on a military pay raise because, in their
							view, it doesn't accomplish anything positive but does raise the level
							of government expenditure. With all the other complicated problems,
							there is great competition for any additional funds that become
							available and the Ministry of National Defense stands little chance of
							winning in the competition. The Ambassador asked why, if the problem is
							so serious, additional funds could not be raised from Korean revenues
							and set aside in the budget for a pay raise as is done in the United
							States. The Minister replied that this might be reasonable and logical
							in the United States, but it would not work that way in Korea.</p>
                        <p>11. The Ambassador commented that any pay raise, especially one that
							included adjustment of civil service pay, would have to be financed
							substantially out of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> revenues.
							Therefore, there would have to be concerted approach to the problem both
							within the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and between the U.S.
							Government and the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. The U.S.
							Government was not willing to make available additional funds for this
							purpose until such a concerted attack had produced a feasible solution,
							consistent with stabilization objectives. It was our belief that a
							substantial pay raise could be accommodated from prospective revenues
							that would accrue to the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and still
							leave funds for other important objectives. The Minister replied that he
							had frequently raised this problem with Mr. Chang Ki-yong, Economic
							Planning Minister, but <persName>Chang</persName> was not willing to
							stand up and talk for military expenditures. When
								<persName>Chang</persName> thinks he is going to have additional
							funds, he is reluctant to have the funds set aside for military
							expenditures that would be losing money which could be expended for
							other objectives. The Ambassador asked whether Mr.
								<persName>Chang</persName> knew of the Ministry's request for 30
							million dollars from the U.S. for a pay increase. Noting that he had not
							spoken directly to Mr. <persName>Chang</persName> about it, the Minister
							replied that the EPB generally agrees with the proposal on the condition
							that “we get the money from you.” The Minister then said that if the
							U.S. would give only 20 million dollars, he perhaps could get Chang to
							make available the remaining 10 million dollars.</p>
                        <p>12. The Ambassador tried to conclude this phase of the discussion by
							noting that he would ask the Economic Planning Minister to look <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0116"/>at the problem and would say that
							the U.S. was prepared to work cooperatively on the problem. The military
							budget was a very important part of the total budget, very basic, and
							we, General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName>, Mr.
							Bernstein, and the Ambassador, would not like to see a large increase in
							revenues go entirely for non-military uses with nothing for an increase
							in military pay. The Minister said he appreciated such support from the
							U.S. side but that he needed not only moral support, but direct tangible
							assistance.</p>
                        <p>13. The Minister asked whether the Ambassador's refusal of his request
							applied only to what was asked for in cash, or to supplies of wheat as
							well. He said he needed more than U.S. help in raising <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> revenues and if he could not get
							help, he would have to take up residence in the United States. The
							Ambassador again explained that the U.S. could not take action on a
							proposal that was not completely worked out and approved by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. He pointed out that this could not
							be considered simply as a military problem. Finally, he stressed that
							the problem must be worked out here and not in Washington. He explained
							that Washington was not prepared to negotiate with the Minister on any
							concrete problems or issues. Concrete results would emerge from the
							President's meeting with President Pak. However, these results would
							embody substantive decision reflected in the communique and agreed
							between the two governments here in Seoul before the President leaves
							for Washington.</p>
                        <p>14. The Minister then spoke of his concern for the defense of Asia, not
							just of Korea. He hoped that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> would continue to reflect his views to Washington.
							The Ambassador was so powerful in Washington that no tree could resist
							his push. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces were on the
							very point of starvation. There was a saying in Korea that no tree could
							sustain the blows of the ax. The Minister had struck only two blows and
							he intended to cut the Ambassador eight more times in order to get some
							relief on the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer and some
							assistance on the military pay increase. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> replied that he was used to being
							hacked at.</p>
                        <p>15. The Ambassador asked the Minister if he still planned to stay over in
							Washington for several days after President Pak departed. The Minister
							said that in view of Washington's attitude, it might not be worth while
							for him to stay; President Pak would decide. Once again the Ambassador
							assured the Minister that he would be welcome but could not expect to
							conduct any business talks with defense officials while he is in the
							United States.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister said he had asked us to come because the government
							had received a request from the government of South Viet Nam for combat
							troops. He wanted to make it quite clear that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> wanted to send combat troops and to
							make its contribution to the defense of Southeast Asia. They were about
							to begin consultation with leading members of the Assembly on this
							subject.</p>
                        <p>There were, however, certain problems with the Assembly which had been
							illustrated at the time when approval of the dispatch of 2,000
							non-combat troops had been requested. The opposition at that time had
							asked what assurances the government had received from the United States
							to guard against the difficulties which would be created for Korea by
							sending these troops, for example additional risk of aggression from the
							north.</p>
                        <p>Specifically they had raised the following points:</p>
                        <p>1) Had the government been able to get a commitment from the United
							States to revise the 1953 defense treaty so that an attack on Korea
							would be regarded as an attack on the United States?</p>
                        <p>To this the government had replied that this was not necessary because
							the presence of substantial US forces in Korea was in itself a guarantee
							of US action, since those forces would themselves be the subject of any
							conceivable attack.</p>
                        <p>2) Had the government received an assurance from the United States that
							it would not withdraw any of its forces now stationed in Korea?</p>
                        <p>3) Had the government been able to secure a repeal or extension of the
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer program?</p>
                        <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0118"/>
                        <p>To this the government had replied they had not, but the US Government
							had agreed to make certain adjustments in the program which would be
							helpful.</p>
                        <p>4) Had the government taken steps to get an increase in the level of
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to compensate for the sharp
							decrease which had taken place in recent years as result of which the
							Korean forces were inadequately equipped even to defend their own
							country, much less to go off to help in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>To this the government replied they were constantly in touch with US
							authorities about military assistance. In any event they did not feel
							that the dispatch of troops to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> was a
							matter for bargaining with the US, but was a moral obligation on Korea's
							part.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said there were many questions raised by the
							opposition on the earlier occasion of troop dispatch and that they would
							all come up again with renewed force when the government presented the
							request to the Assembly for authorization to send combat troops. It
							would be very helpful if certain assurances could be given to the
							President while he was in Washington and reflected in the communique so
							that he would be in a strong position to answer any such questions.</p>
                        <p>The situation was further complicated by the fact that the government was
							already pressing the Assembly for ratification of the settlement with
							Japan and encountering serious difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister repeated that the government was determined to send
							combat troops and was not in any way bargaining with us about this. He
							was simply asking for help to enable the President to be able to do
							it.</p>
                        <p>The matters on which the President would like reassurance in Washington,
							in addition to those raised by the opposition, were the question of a
							pay raise for the armed forces, which was desperately needed, and
							increased trade with <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. If the
							President could come back also with assurances on these two points, it
							would be very helpful.</p>
                        <p>It was true that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							had singled out President Pak for special personal courtesies such as
							sending his private airplane to Seoul and scheduling a fine parade for
							the President in New York City. These were greatly appreciated. But if
							the President simply went to the United States and was cordially and
							honorably received and came back without anything specific to show for
							his visit, this would not help.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he did not think the allotment of $150
							million of DLF funds over the next few years would make much impression
							on the Korean public, particularly since it would be realized only in
							small amounts in view of our insistence on projects. He recalled <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>that when he had been Ambassador
							in Washington $70 million had been allotted for one year, but because of
							lack of projects only about $40 million had been realized. He was afraid
							that this would happen again and that the government would be criticized
							by the opposition because of it.</p>
                        <p>I said that the Prime Minister had expressed himself with his customary
							lucidity and frankness, and I hoped he would allow me to be equally
							frank. I would try to be equally clear.</p>
                        <p>But first of all I would like to know exactly what the SVNG had asked for
							and whether I could see a copy of the letter from the SVNG. This was
							produced and was simply a brief two paragraphs saying in effect
							“additional combat troops would be very helpful here and we would
							appreciate your sending combat troops at your earliest convenience.”
							There were no specifics as to the nature or quantity of the units being
							requested nor any indication of the job they would be expected to
							do.</p>
                        <p>I said that as the Prime Minister undoubtedly knew, when Ambassador Lodge
							was here he had told President Pak that we had been discussing with the
							SVNG the possible need for additional troops and he had told President
							Pak that a request for a regimental combat team might be forthcoming. He
							had not then made any such request.</p>
                        <p>I said that this letter had been sent by the SVNG without our knowledge,
							and that when it had been sent I had been asked by Washington to speak
							to the President immediately about it. I had done so on the evening of
							May 7 before the government had received the letter. I had told
							President Pak that while we believed that dispatch of a Korean
							regimental combat team to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would be
							desirable, we appreciated that this might cause him serious political
							difficulties, particularly with respect to the ratification of the
							agreement with Japan, and that I had been instructed to tell him that we
							would not ask him to take any action which in his view should cause him
							serious difficulties in that connection, and that a delay in action on
							this request until after the ratification would not in our view cause
							serious difficulty.</p>
                        <p>I very much appreciated, and I knew our government would very much
							appreciate the desire of the Korean government to contribute combat
							troops. Our position on timing was as I had stated to President Pak.</p>
                        <p>I said that I was well aware of the matter raised by the opposition and
							likely to be raised by them again. I felt that the answers given by the
							government on the previous occasion had been exactly right. I
							particularly welcomed the Prime Minster's statement both to the Assembly
							and to me today that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> did not
							wish to bargain on this matter. We agreed that this was not a matter for
							bargaining and we did not propose to bargain.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0120"/>
                        <p>As I had explained to the Minister of National Defense on May 6,<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">See <ref target="#d42">Document
								42</ref>.</note> and as I had explained to the Vice Minister of
							Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mun Tok-chu, it was not possible under our
							constitutional system for the President to change the treaty commitment
							which we had with Korea, even if he wished to do so. Moreover he could
							not make any commitment to keep any specific number of troops in any
							specific locality for any specific period of time. Nor could he give
							assurance of the maintenance of any specific level of military
							assistance.</p>
                        <p>He could, however, and would gladly do so, give very positive assurance
							to Korea of the continued military support of the United States. The
							form in which we proposed he should do so was contained in the draft
							communique which we had given to Mr. Mun as our suggested revision of
							the Korean draft.<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">Documents tracing the
								negotiations on the contents of the communique released at the
								conclusion of the Pak visit are in National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>.</note> We were also prepared to recommend to
							Washington some wording changes suggested by Mr. Chang Sang Mun to Mr.
							Doherty yesterday at his meeting with Mr. Mun which were designed to
							increase the sense of urgency of our commitment. We felt that the
							language of our draft was a very strong and powerful assurance which
							should clearly comfort the Korean people.</p>
                        <p>I had not been able to persuade Washington to go any further on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer than the memorandum which I
							had given the Prime Minister some weeks ago. If the President continues
							to feel very strongly on this matter I could only suggest that he bring
							it up personally in Washington. So far as Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. Bell were concerned
							we could go no further.</p>
                        <p>I repeated to the Prime Minister what I had said to the Minister of
							National Defense. (See Memorandum of Conversation enclosed with
							Embassy's A–550)<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4">Reference should be to
								airgram A–551 from Seoul; see <ref target="#d42">Document
								42</ref>.</note> about the pay raise question.)</p>
                        <p>I said that we already working on expanding opportunities for Korean
							trade in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>; that we are hopeful of
							significant results and that we are prepared to consider recommending to
							Washington that some reference to this matter be included in the
							communique.</p>
                        <p>I said that all of us in Seoul would do our best to try to get the
							highest possible level of military assistance of the Korean forces and
							that I was encouraged that aid to Viet Nam had now been separated from
							the regular <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> legislation, thus I
							hoped lightening the burden on the regular <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program.</p>
                        <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0121"/>
                        <p>I said that we thought $150 million of new development money under the
							most favorable terms available anywhere in the world was a real
							contribution; that the speed with which it was used depended entirely on
							the Korean government and that we were prepared to provide more as soon
							as it was used up. If some language change could be made to make it
							clearer that this money was all immediately available, we would be glad
							to consider it. I feel that if the matter were presented to the Korean
							public in this light it would be appreciated by them.</p>
                        <p>I said that I welcomed the discussion which we had just had because I
							felt that it brought into focus things which had been said on both sides
							many times. I felt that we now had had sufficient discussion of the
							issues; that everyone on the American side had a very clear idea of what
							the Korean government wanted and why. I thought the time had now come to
							get down to actual language. On this the ball was entirely in the Korean
							government's court. We had considered the Korean first draft and had
							presented our ideas on what we thought the language should be. If the
							Koreans had any specific suggestions to make I hoped Mr. Mun would make
							them in his meeting this afternoon with Mr. Doherty. I felt that no
							useful purpose would be served in further general discussions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he understood that we could not for
							constitutional reasons give the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
							commitment, but if <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer were to
							be pressed further he assumed there would be no difficulty in the
							Minister of National Defense doing so in Washington. (I said it would
							have to be done by the President.) The Prime Minister said that the
							government would shortly present to us a program dealing with the pay
							raise problem; that he appreciated my explanation of the DLF matter and
							would suggest some language to improve the impression for the Korean
							point of view, and that he agreed we could get down to work on actual
							drafting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mun said that my explanation of our constitutional problems had
							clarified the reasons for some of our positions and he would certainly
							take these into account and would have specific language to suggest to
							Mr. Doherty.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lee Hu-rak came in just about the time we were discussing the DLF
							fund, and said that the phrase “over the next few years” was
							troublesome. He also noted that our communique omitted reference to
							trade and again raised the question of a commitment to maintain our
							present level of troops. I said that the last was not possible, but that
							we were prepared to recommend deletion of the phrase he found
							troublesome and mention of trade in the communique.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It was obvious that all present were
							very disappointed. Gloom started to descend very obviously as soon as I

								times of emergency. (Ibid.)</note> For <persName>Bundy</persName>
							from Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>1. The long and painful chapter of <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
							negotiations is drawing to a close. Only one real obstacle remains. The
							means of surmounting it with satisfaction and respect on both sides are
							set forth in <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. The obstacle in question is our hitherto adamant insistence on a
							provision denying Korean employees of US forces the ultimate right to
							strike and the equally adamant refusal of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, unanimously and vocally supported by public,
							legislative and editorial opinion to agree to this prohibition.</p>
                        <p>3. Long and strenuous negotiations have convinced us that we have no hope
							of getting the Koreans to agree to such a clause. Its enforceability is
							highly questionable. It would provide an instance of what all Koreans of
							whatever party will rightly or wrongly consider <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0124"/>injustice and discrimination and which
							those who wish us ill both in Korea and elsewhere can and will exploit
							to our disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>4. The Korean Government would find it most difficult successfully to
							defend this clause before its Assembly and public opinion. It does not
							appear in any of our other <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>s, not
							with China, nor with Japan, nor with the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>5. This is a matter of public discussion in Korea now. If agreed to,
							there is serious likelihood of a strike against this clause when it is
							announced. The government, which is genuinely anxious to help us avoid
							strikes, could not oppose this one.</p>
                        <p>6. The proposal contained in <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>
							gives real, and we think sufficient, protection for our interests. It
							even provides for a qualified no strike clause under conditions of need,
							but does so on a basis which the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							will be able to support us. We will need this support in such a
							case.</p>
                        <p>7. I am convinced that the Koreans cannot be pushed further on this
							point. I believe that the clause we propose is in the best interests of
							the US, both in terms of the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
							itself and in terms of our overall interests in Korea and elsewhere. I
							believe that with this clause in hand we can now get satisfactory
							agreement and close the deal. Without it there is little or no chance of
							agreement.</p>
                        <p>8. I therefore endorse the reasoning of the negotiating team contained
								<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss> and recommend Washington's
							speedy acceptance of this proposal.</p>

							steps to be sure that Park is aware you may wish to lead off this way,
							and that his interpreter will be someone in whose discretion he has
							complete confidence.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
								contribution to South Viet-Nam</hi>. As you know, the Honolulu
							meeting included discussion re a possible Korean regimental combat team
							(4000 men or so) some time in the next two months, with the possibility
							that at a later phase the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
							might be expanded to a division. Ambassador Lodge and Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> have discussed <hi rend="italic">with Park only</hi> the possibility of the <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> only</hi>. Park has responded
							that this would take serious thought, and we have been most anxious not
							to let this possibility become public in Korea, because of its possible
							impact on his major political problem of getting ratification of the
							agreement with Japan. We suggest you refer to the <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> possibility but indicate that you are
							well aware of his political problem. This would be the right occasion to
							draw him out as to just how he does see his political situation and its
							impact on further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat force
							contributions in South Viet-Nam. You will certainly wish to lead off by
							thanking him warmly for the contribution they have already made.</p>
                        <p>In this connection the South Vietnamese Government has conveyed a formal
							request to Park for additional Korean forces, and we have consulted with
							Park to head off publicity. This request itself does not change
							anything, as the South Vietnamese (who acted without telling us) will
							certainly not press unless we urge them to. The real question is whether
							Park can now bite off the issue of additional troops—requiring formal
							Assembly approval—at the same time that he has his major fight on
							ratifying the Japan settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Additional Project</hi>. We are looking urgently for
							a special proposal arising directly from these talks, such as the joint
							medical project at the time of the <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> visit. The best bets appear to be introduction of
								<pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0126"/>the Peace Corps into Korea,
							and/or an expansion of English-language training in Korea in the
							interests of world-wide communication. Your staff and we will have final
							recommendations on this at your briefing session at 4:30.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Status of Forces Agreement with Korea. We do not
								recommend that you raise this topic.</hi> However, Park might do so
							in your private session. We recommend that you refer this matter to my
							conversation the following morning, saying only that we want to do the
							right and fair thing.</p>
                        <p>The first two topics are in addition to those covered in the basic
							memorandum to you,<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">A May 13 memorandum from
									<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to President
									<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> outlined the
								major points President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and Pak would likely discuss. (National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66,
									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The major points made in <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s memorandum were also delineated in a
								memorandum from Thomson to <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>; see <ref target="#d47">Document
								47</ref>.</note> some or all of which could also be covered in the
							private session as you see fit. Park will undoubtedly benefit from a
							substantial private talk with you before you join the larger group in
							the Cabinet Room, and we would see no problem in your extending the
							private session as much as you and he feel wise.</p>

                            <item>Your Meeting at 5 p.m. today with President Park </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>President Chung Hee Park has come to Washington for one paramount reason:
							he seeks the strongest possible indication from us, both through our
							courtesies to him and through tangible evidence of continuing U.S.
							assistance, that <hi rend="italic">we have no intention of abandoning
								Korea to Japanese control</hi> in the wake of a Japan-Korea
							settlement. Whatever <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0127"/>reassurance
							we can give him will ease the severe problems he faces in gaining the
							support of his people for the ratification and acceptance of such a
							settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Personal Factors:</hi> Park is a shy, intelligent man
							born of a farm family, he has spent most of his life in his nation's
							armed forces. He is said to be self-conscious of his height and
							therefore initially rather formal and stiff; he can respond to
							informality, however, once he feels at ease. His one form of recreation
							is horseback riding.</p>
                        <p>As you know, you met Park when he came to this country in November 1961
							shortly after seizing power by a military coup: you met him again when
							he came to President Kennedy's funeral.</p>
                        <p>In the attached memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d47fn2">See <ref target="#d46fn2">footnote 2, Document 46</ref>.</note> (which
							you have already seen) State has suggested certain topics that might
							arise in your talks. Here is a brief review of the major points:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Japan-Korea Settlement:</hi> Both parties have made
							great progress, and a basic treaty has been initialed; it should be
							signed within a few weeks, and ratification will probably come in July.
							We are deeply gratified with this progress, and Park's determination has
							been the chief ingredient. A settlement should bring a new and mutually
							productive relationship between two complementary economies and two
							natural allies.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Assistance to Vietnam:</hi> The Koreans now have
							2,200 troops in Vietnam (including a military hospital unit, 10 karate
							instructors, an engineer battalion, a <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>, and an infantry battalion to provide security for
							these forces). We are deeply grateful for this assistance—given despite
							strong opposition from Park's political opponents. The <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> has now asked for further Korean
							troops. It is our judgement that a decision on such additional forces
							should be delayed until Park overcomes the acute problems he currently
							faces in pushing through a Japan-Korea settlement. (For your
							information: the Koreans had hoped to use the question of further troops
							in order to pry major additional concessions out of the U.S. Government
							during the Park visit; for this reason we should avoid specific
							discussions at this moment.)</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">U.S. Aid to Korea:</hi> Park will want all the
							reassurance we can give him on our continued economic support. We
							propose to include in the communique a general aid pledge: to finance
							Korea's essential imports, to make available $150 million in development
							loan funds over the next few years, to continue technical assistance and
							training, and to keep up our Food for Peace aid. (<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> returned from Korea deeply
							impressed with their economic progress.)</p>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">U.S. and Korean Force Levels in Korea:</hi> The
							Koreans have wanted a very specific commitment from us to maintain our
							forces in Korea at their present level. They also seek our commitment to
							maintain sufficient assistance to keep their 600,000 troops at the
							present level. All we can say in response is that our commitment to
							their defense is absolute under the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty, and that
							we would certainly consult with them on any changes in force levels
							which might be dictated by our regional and global requirements.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Map Transfer Problem:</hi> The Koreans have been
							disturbed by our “<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer” program
							since 1960—an effort to transfer the procurement there from the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to the Korean budget on materials that
							are obtainable on a commercial basis in Korea. Although we have delayed
							and softened certain aspects of this program, we cannot meet the Korean
							request in toto but are willing to indicate in the communique that
							certain adjustments have been made in order to ease the impact on the
							Korean economy.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Other Items:</p>
                        <p>Park will urge that we move towards a speedy conclusion of a Status of
							Forces Agreement. We are very close to such an agreement under a formula
							modeled on our agreement with Germany; and we can assure him that we
							share his desire to see this matter speedily resolved (but not during
							the course of his visit). Park may also raise the issue of Korean
							unification. Here our position is his, namely that unification will be
							possible only through the U.N. formula of free elections under U.N.
							supervision.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that the
							U.S. planned to extend all possible aid to Korea. It planned to keep its
							troops there, and no reduction of troop strength was contemplated.
							However, if there were an adjustment, President Park would be the first
							to know about it, and full consultation would be held beforehand.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> congratulated
							Park on the happy progress of the Korea-Japan negotiations and said that
							he considered President Park to be the chief ingredient in the success
							of these negotiations. He felt that it was due to Park's leadership that
							things had been going so well. He realized that it had been a very tough
							and touchy problem. He felt that conclusion of the Korea-Japan treaty
							would also assist our mutual effort in Viet-Nam. President Park said he
							felt that the Korea-Japan negotiations could be concluded within a
							month, by early or middle June. He said that there were certain
							irresponsible people who were trying to block the negotiations, but he
							felt his public relations and other efforts would ensure conclusion of
							the agreement.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> congratulated
							President Park on his assistance in the struggle in Viet-Nam, and said,
							with reference to that aid that we would keep in Korea a military
							strength equivalent to that at present so that, in accordance with our
							commitments under the 1954 treaty,<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">The Mutual
								Defense Treaty between the United States and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> was signed at Washington on October
								1, 1953, and went into effect on November 17, 1954. (5 <gloss target="#t_UST1">UST</gloss> 2368)</note> Korean security would
							not suffer.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then emphasized
							how much more difficult it was now to get aid through Congress than it
							had been 20 years ago <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0130"/>when the
							aid program first began. He said that the 2,000 Korean troops that had
							been sent to Viet-Nam in his opinion had helped save the aid bill in
							Congress. He asked President Park whether he felt additional Korean
							troops could be sent to Viet-Nam from Korea. President Park stated that
							the Korean Government would have to study that matter. The people in
							Korea were worried whether they might not invite further activity from
							North Korea if they weakened the line by sending too many troops to
							Viet-Nam. However, he said that he personally would like to send more
							troops to Viet-Nam. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then asked President Park if he could send one
							division. If President Park could raise the commitment to one division,
							this would help a great deal in the struggle there. President Park
							repeated that it was his personal feeling that Korea could make larger
							commitments of troops to Viet-Nam, but this would have to be studied by
							his Government, and he could not make a commitment on it at this
							time.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that at the
							present time he was searching for a diplomatic solution in Viet-Nam. He
							also hoped that eventually there could be a solution to the problem of
							the unification of Korea; but this would have to be done under the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formula of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision of free elections.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said he wanted
							to tell the Korean Government that aid would be assured to that country
							and that the U.S. would finance essential imports and development loans,
							technical assistance, and food for peace. The impression the American
							Government had of Korea had never been better. After his visit to Korea,
							Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> had reported great
							progress in the economic field.</p>
                        <p>President Park said he hoped very much that there would be no indication
							from Washington that there would be any withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops from Korea. This sort of talk made
							it very difficult for him to help in Viet-Nam, because his own people
							became very disturbed any time there was any talk of withdrawal of
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops from Korea. President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> referred to the
							strong support in the Congress for his Viet-Nam program and said he
							would see to it that Korea's security is ensured, that troops and money
							enough will be provided to ensure this in accordance with the 1954
							treaty. He said that, if any troops were to be removed from Korea, it
							would only be done with prior consultation.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said he believed
							that, if they can get an agreement or some basis for agreement in South
							Viet-Nam, this would also relieve the pressure from North Korea. He
							hoped that the Australians, the Filipinos, and New Zealanders would all
							help in Viet-Nam and he also hoped to get a Korean division into
							Viet-Nam so that they could get a total of 70,000 to 80,000 troops in
							Viet-Nam from various nations to be able to win there.</p>
                        <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0131"/>
                        <p>On the status of forces agreement President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> stated that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> was working on that problem and
							that we would follow the same formula as was used in Germany. This had
							worked very well in Germany and should work well in Korea. He was glad
							the negotiations were going ahead well; but he did not think they could
							be concluded during this State Visit. President Park said that he
							thought these negotiations had gone on too long and were becoming a
							major irritant to many of his people, particularly the Opposition. He
							hoped President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would
							break into the negotiations with an order to somehow bring them to a
							speedy conclusion.</p>
                        <p>President Park said 1967 was the last year of his first economic
							development program and that a second five-year development program was
							planned. Koreans would need continued assistance from the U.S. to help
							them with this. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							spoke of the $100 billion foreign aid which the U.S. had given since
							World War II to countries overseas and the 160,000 U.S. casualties which
							we have suffered since World War II. He said there were many people in
							Congress who had opposed spending this $100 billion. The way that some
							countries acted made it very difficult to get aid out of Congress. He
							said that when Sukarno burns USIA libraries and offices, people in
							Congress are of a mind to cut off all foreign aid. He considered Korea's
							conduct very helpful. He said that Park's policy in Korea went all the
							way in backing up the Viet-Nam effort, and again he stated that this was
							a great help to him and that it improved the military situation in
							Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Asked whether the Koreans had asked any other nations in Asia to help out
							in Viet-Nam, President Park said no they had not. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said the U.S. feels the same
							way about its commitments in Viet-Nam and Korea, and feels that Korea
							has been the greatest assistance in helping to bring pressure to bear so
							that other countries like Australia and New Zealand would come in.
							Britain, he realized, was very much occupied in Malaysia. The President
							concluded by repeating the hope that Korea would increase its commitment
							to one division.</p>

                        <p>The following two points were worth noting:</p>
                        <p>1. With reference to military pay, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that, just as we will not tolerate
							inappropriately low pay for our military forces, we would not expect the
							Koreans to tolerate such low pay for their military forces. He said that
							he did not conceive of paying the forces too little in order to finance
							military equipment or to permit <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							transfers. He suggested that the Koreans and Americans conduct a joint
							study on Korean military pay. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> concurred in the suggestion.<note n="2" xml:id="d49fn2">The Minister of Defense submitted a formal request
								for the formation of the committee on June 17, just after General
									<persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> assumed his duties
								as Commander of U.S. Forces in Korea on June 15. On June 19
									<persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> agreed to form the
								committee and recommended that membership be limited to U.S. and
									<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military representatives
								empowered solely to examine Korean military pay levels. (Airgram
								A–641 from Seoul, June 30; National Archives and Records

								and recommendations on July 22. The committee determined that a 100
								percent pay increase for noncareer personnel and an 83.5 percent
								increase for career NCOs and officers were justified. (Airgram A–84

                        </p>
                        <p>2. With respect to <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfers,
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that
							it is our view that the transfers can be absorbed by the Korean economy
							but agreed that the transfer program should be reviewed each year in the
							light of the condition of the Korean economy.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he wished
							to extend to President Park a cordial welcome to the Department of
							State. He regretted he had not been able to remain at the White House
							the previous evening to say good-bye, but he had worked in his office
							until 5:00 a.m.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">The previous evening
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and his wife attended
								the State Dinner at the White House held in honor of Pak. (Ibid.,
								President's Daily Diary) <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
								apparently returned to his office to monitor events in the Dominican
								Republic.</note> He and his staff and associates were available for
							any matters the President might wish to raise. He suggested, however,
							that they might address themselves to the Joint Communique.</p>
                        <p>President Park thanked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. He said he had had a very good talk with President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> the previous day, and
							had found that <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0134"/>President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had a good
							understanding of the Korean situation. There remained, however, several
							problems that should be discussed.</p>
                        <p>President Park said that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> on the preceding day had agreed that there were
							no serious problems remaining on the status of forces agreement
							negotiations. On reduction of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Forces
							in Korea, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had
							said that he hoped there would not be any reduction, but if there were
							it would be discussed fully with the Koreans beforehand. Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> commented that we were in
							agreement on what should be said on this point—that the U.S. would
							continue to maintain powerful forces in Korea. He also reminded
							President Park that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in his welcoming speech on President Park's
							arrival had said that the U.S. would stand side by side with the Koreans
							as long as a danger exists.</p>
                        <p>President Park reported that at breakfast with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and others, he had discussed
							the “<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer” problem, which has an
							effect on the Korean economy and morale. He said he hoped that this
							problem would be carefully considered in the Communique. He then
							referred to the phrase “over the next few years” which qualified the
							$150 million Development Loan funds in paragraph 9B.<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">The joint communique released at the conclusion of
								Pak's visit is in American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965,
								pp. 779–781.</note> He said he understood the appropriation and
							executive processes that would be involved in use of those funds, but
							that its inclusion in a public Communique would invite Opposition
							criticism of his Government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Status of Forces Agreement Negotiations</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he always
							enjoyed talking with President Park because they were clear in their
							expressions to one another, and did not waste time. He suggested they
							address themselves to the status of forces negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he had a
							statement to make on those negotiations, and he asked that his remarks
							be interpreted sentence by sentence. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we should all be pleased
							to note that several major issues had been resolved during recent weeks.
							A number of important issues remained to be resolved, however, so it did
							not seem possible to agree upon the text of an agreement during
							President Park's stay. It seemed that two principal differences
							remained—on the criminal jurisdiction and labor articles. With respect
							to the criminal jurisdiction article, the Secretary said we had gone as
							far as we could go on the waiver proposal and trial safeguards, and he
							believed that the Korean Government should try to meet our position on
							these two points.</p>
                        <p>We were not expressing any lack of confidence, the Secretary went on to
							say, in the legal systems of the two countries. Our attitude had <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0135"/>nothing to do with special
							arrangements, such as those of the 19th Century period which gave so
							much trouble. We were not raising issues with regard to tourists,
							businessmen, or others who were in Korea on a voluntary basis. But where
							we required men under compulsory military service to serve in
							Korea—taking farmers from Kansas and workers from Pittsburgh—we believed
							they have the right to protection in situations where they inadvertently
							have difficulty. The formula we had proposed is the one in effect in
							Germany where the U.S. has over 200,000 troops, and which has worked
							well on both sides. It would be difficult to explain why this formula
							would not be acceptable in Korea. We hoped the Koreans could meet us on
							this point.</p>
                        <p>On the labor article, the Secretary said we were prepared to accept the
							Korean proposal on the right of Korean employees to strike if a labor
							dispute was not resolved by the end of a 70-day period. A Joint
							Committee would designate certain essential categories where the right
							to strike would not be exercised. If the Korean Government was willing
							to agree to our proposals on the waiver and trial safeguards, then we
							could announce that agreement in principle had been reached and
							agreement on the remaining issues could be reached in the very near
							future.</p>
                        <p>President Park agreed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">“<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer”
							Program</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then referred to the
							differences of view regarding reference to the “<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer” program in the Joint Communique. He suggested
							a further addition to paragraph 5 of the Communique, as follows: “It was
							agreed that the program should be reviewed each year in light of the
							condition of the Korean economy.” President Park agreed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Development Loans “over the next few years”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that we all
							understood what was intended with regard to the Development Loan funds
							of $150 million, that the language should not be interpreted as a
							one-year commitment. It was difficult because on the Korean side there
							were popular sensitivities, while on our side there was the caution of
							the U.S. Congress. Last year Korea used $26 million in development
							loans, while this year it has used $46 million. It was important that
							the development loan language in the Communique not be interpreted as a
							one-year figure, as this would cause us difficulties. We try as a matter
							of general policy to avoid specific figures in communiques with
							distinguished foreign visitors. We had made an exception in this case
							because of our strong interest in Korea and in the success of its
							Government. We would like to meet the Korean needs on this point. He
							suggested that the words “over the next few years” be deleted from the
							second sentence of paragraph 9B <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0136"/>of the draft Communique, and inserted in the fifth sentence. This
							should help the Korean side, although it would cause us some
							difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General Lee commented that this would still leave these
							difficult words in the Communique. He suggested they be rephrased to
							make reference to U.S. constitutional requirements and U.S.
							procedures.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that in
							the fifth sentence, the words would apply also to the additional monies
							to be made available which would clearly be available over a period of
							years.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> added that to use a
							specific figure, to say that the funds would be used as rapidly as
							possible, and to say that other monies would then be made available
							would give us serious difficulties with Congress, if it appeared that
							the funds were to be used in one year. We were prepared to say the funds
							would be used as rapidly as possible. He hoped the Koreans would be able
							to accept the words “over the next few years” in the latter part of the
							paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General Lee said that, if the commitment were put this way, it
							would be vague and meaningless to the Korean public. It would weaken the
							whole impact.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there must be some misunderstanding of what we
							propose. Under our proposal the $150 million would be used as rapidly as
							possible. Then after that is used we anticipate the provision of
							additional loan funds. Obviously the combination of the two comprises a
							commitment extending over the next few years. We might find language
							without the use of any figure. We might just refer to continuing
							development loan backing for the Korean Government with no reference to
							amounts or time. But when we say we will provide $150 million as soon as
							possible, and then more, that seems the best formulation for the Korean
							Government. If we say that, we need the phrase “over the next few years”
							or an unlimited blank check would be implied which we could not explain
							to our own people.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> made the point that
							it seemed to him that the basic point to be made was that a Korea-Japan
							agreement would not mean that the U.S. would run away. We were trying to
							say so eloquently, and it seemed to him that $150 million was an
							eloquent figure.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General Lee said that he believed it would be better not to use
							the figure if that required the qualifying words “over the next few
							years”. He said it was well understood that the Korean Government would
							not use the funds in one year, or extend the use over an indefinite
							number of years.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> commented that
							the Communique would say not that $150 million would be used over the
							next few years, but that $150 million plus additional monies would be
							used in such a period. It should be easy to explain that.</p>
                        <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he was
							concerned lest there be too wide a gap between the explanations of the
							Communique by the Korean and U.S. Governments. The Korean Government
							should be able to explain to its Assembly that the U.S. had created a
							fund of $150 million, which would be used as rapidly as possible, and
							then more monies would be available. This should make it clear that the
							U.S. was not losing interest in Korea.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Secretary said he had some matters to discuss with
							President Park alone. He suggested they step across the hall into his
							office, and let the other members of the party try to resolve language
							differences in the meanwhile.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of President Park and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, the other participants reached agreement on the
							following changes:</p>
                        <p>1) The following sentence was to be added to paragraph 7: “He confirmed
							that U.S. military and economic assistance to Korea would continue to be
							extended, as set forth in paragraph 9 below, after normalization of
							Korean-Japanese relations.” Accordingly, the following closing words of
							the first sentence of paragraph 9 would be deleted: “after the
							normalization of relations between Korea and Japan.”</p>
                        <p>2) The words “over the next few years” would be deleted in the second
							sentence of paragraph 9B, and the fifth sentence of that paragraph would
							be rephrased to begin as follows: “Such development loan funds would be
							made available, in accordance with annual legislation and joint economic
							judgments, to finance… .”</p>
                        <p>Upon their return, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
							said that the Korean Government was getting the money, and would it not
							give the U.S. Government the words? President Park said he did not
							understand all the words in the Communique, but he was prepared to trust
							the U.S. Government. Where would we be if we did not trust one
							another?</p>
                        <p>Secretary General Lee asked whether it would not be possible to drop the
							words “in accordance with annual legislation and joint economic
							judgments”. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said
							the U.S. could not drop them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that each
							side name a coordinator to agree upon the approved text, and named Mr.
								<persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName> for the U.S. President
							Park named Acting Foreign Minister Moon for Korea.</p>

                        <p>The President welcomed President Park and congratulated him warmly on his
							Press Club speech of that noon; he understood that it had been very well
							received, and this was high praise since the Press Club audience was a
							tough one.</p>
                        <p>The President said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> had forwarded him a letter dated May 7 which
							contained a check from the Korean people to assist the victims of the
							tornadoes which had devastated the Midwest in April. The letter
							indicated that the check was intended both to help the victims of the
							tornadoes and to strengthen friendship between Korea and the United
							States. This gift was symbolic of the way the people of the two
							countries feel about each other. This brotherly and neighborly gesture
							was worth more to us than millions of dollars; it was deeply touching.
							The President asked President Park to tell the National Council which
							had sent the letter and check that the money <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0139"/>would be used to assist veterans of the Korean War who
							had suffered loss of their homes or of members of their families in the
							tornadoes.</p>
                        <p>The President said that every chair had been filled at the dinner the
							previous evening. That morning a number of the guests had told Mrs.
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and him how indebted
							they were for having been included to honor President Park and, through
							him, the people of Korea. The President said that he and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had been much pleased to see
							how many people had been prepared to travel all the way across the
							country to attend the dinner.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the previous day President Park and he, at his
							initiative, had covered a number of topics which he had thought were of
							greatest interest to President Park and to the Korean people. The topics
							had included a status of forces agreement, Korean unification, economic
							assistance, support of the Korean forces, and assurances that the United
							States would not withdraw armed forces from Korea, at least without
							first obtaining the understanding of the Korean Government.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he and President Park appeared to have pretty
							well covered the waterfront when they finished. He had asked President
							Park a number of times whether he had something to raise, and had asked
							him not to hesitate to do so. He would welcome the President's now
							raising anything he might wish.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had been trying to keep the rebels and the
							loyalists in the Dominican Republic from attacking each other throughout
							the night.</p>
                        <p>President Park said that it might seem a small matter but he wished to
							note that he had discussed the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							Transfer Program with the Secretary of Defense at breakfast. Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> had said that he
							understood the difficulty, that he would study the matter further, and
							that he would keep it under review. President Park said that he would
							like the President, too, to keep it in mind.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was familiar with the program. He would be
							happy to make the gesture of eliminating this requirement but this would
							lead to trouble with Congress. He said that he understood the
							difficulty, however, and that we would be as understanding as we
							could.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he still did not have any indication whether he
							would have three billion dollars or nothing for military and economic
							assistance in the coming year. As President Park had noted, he had had
							to postpone certain visits by friends from other parts of the world
							because he disliked meeting and discussing problems against a background
							of such uncertainty over his own appropriations.</p>
                        <p>President Park said that the Republic of Korea had 600,000 men in its
							armed forces. These men were well-trained and well-disciplined. <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0140"/>He wanted President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to realize that these forces
							really formed part of U.S. forces ready to fight against Communism. In a
							fight they would be with the United States; but at the same time they
							were dependent on U.S. assistance.</p>
                        <p>The President said that President Park's assurance was very heartening.
							The President emphasized what he had said the day before: that the
							action the Koreans have taken in sending forces to Viet-Nam is not only
							a help to us in Viet-Nam, but also on Capitol Hill.</p>
                        <p>President Park said he had an additional item to raise, that of Korea's
							diplomatic relations with African nations. He had discussed this matter
							with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>. Successful
							diplomacy in Africa was important to Korea, and on this matter they
							needed our help; but they could also perhaps be of help to us. This was
							a subject on which the President had undoubtedly been briefed by his
							advisors, but President Park wanted to emphasize the cooperative role
							our two nations might play together in Africa.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> expressed his
							appreciation of President Park's offer of mutual assistance and said
							that we would explore this matter further.</p>
                        <p>President Park commented that his meeting with the Secretary of State
							that morning had been very successful; he was sure that the President
							was informed of the results.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> asked if there
							were any other matters that should be discussed. He repeated that U.S.
							Government officials and the guests at the dinner the night before had
							deeply appreciated the chance to meet with Park. He commented on the
							Administration's high regard for Ambassador Kim and his wife as strong
							friends and allies; he said that they fitted into our society with ease
							and worked with our people most effectively. He wanted to compliment the
							Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>President Park expressed his thanks for the role played by Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>; he noted that a number
							of problems had been solved since Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s arrival.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> responded that
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> was one of our
							most trusted and able officials. He then asked if any of President
							Park's associates desired to raise any further items—otherwise they
							could move on to the communique and then to the reception.</p>
                        <p>Defense Minister Kim raised the problem of the low state of pay of Korean
							armed forces; the pay scale was so low, he said, that they faced serious
							difficulties in morale. The United States should be concerned with this
							matter in considering these forces as its own troops.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he was not familiar with this problem but would
							explore it further with our Secretary of Defense. He said that <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0141"/>Congress was pressing for pay
							increases for our own armed forces, which would be difficult within
							budgetary limits.</p>
                        <p>President Park then expressed his thanks for the communique and also for
							the President's new proposal for an Institute for Technology and Applied
							Science; he was glad to accept this proposal.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> noted that the
							two Presidents belonged to the “same lodge” of school teachers.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Prime Minister <persName>Chang</persName> asked if it would be
							possible to strike out the word “annual” on page 5 of the communique; we
							might substitute the word “applicable”. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> agreed to strike the word
							“annual” without making a substitution. He added, however, that we would
							have to be candid with our own press and Congress, as they realize that
							our assistance is subject to annual legislative review.</p>
                        <p>Secretary General Lee commented that their side understood our
							legislative system in this regard. He added that since we had helped the
							Koreans in this way, they would try to work even harder to make good use
							of our assistance.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that if he
							could always produce documents like this where he went, he would get a
							lot of votes.</p>
                        <p>He asked if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> or
							Ambassador Kim had anything to add; both responded in the negative.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> asked President
							Park to tell Mrs. Park that he and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> were looking forward to seeing them at 7 o'clock
							at the reception; they would be slightly late, because he had some
							further business on his schedule. He concluded the meeting by expressing
							his hope that President Park had enjoyed himself, and that he had found
							U.S. officials helpful and courteous.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Military Assistance Program</hi>—Minister Kim said
							that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> understood the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							had been increased. The Secretary replied that it looked as if there
							might be some increase to the program; at least at this point it looked
							more favorable. He said that the Congress had proposed a substantial
							cut, but that was reversed. We now believe that <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66 will be a satisfactory program. However, he said in
							1966 each country must take effective means to use <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> dollars in the best manner possible.
							For Korea, the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> should help, but it should also be the
							time for the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to consider the
							proper size of the Korean armed forces. The Secretary said that in
							relation to North Korea and Communist China, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> must bear in mind how much strength plus that of the
							U.S. is needed to protect South Korea, but it should not be too large.
							Korea must look at what should be the proper size of its forces in 1966,
							keeping in mind available <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds and
							the pay problem. Kim said that President Park was worried about the
							threat of Red China and North Korea. The Secretary said we should be
							worried about this threat. We would continue to assure that the U.S.
							strength plus that of South Korea was enough—that in considering the
							threat we must always think of the combined power of the South Koreans
							and the U.S. He said that he, personally, thought the South Korean
							forces were too large. The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should
							give careful thought to what size is necessary in respect to its
							resources. The Secretary said we should always keep in mind that the
							Chinese Communists, and <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0143"/>their
							servants the North Koreans, will move toward any weakness, whether it is
							in the south or the north. We must be strong everywhere, and firm, but
							“we do not need two fists when one fist will do.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">South Viet-Nam</hi>. Kim said South Korea has received
							a request from the Government of Viet-Nam for additional South Korean
							forces to be sent to support Viet-Nam; they will do their utmost to help
							that country in its troubles.</p>
                        <p>Kim said the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> war was known as the
								“<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> War,” but since
							the Korean troops are going to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, the
							war is becoming known in Korea as “Kim's War.” The Secretary said that
							the U.S. determination in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> shows the
							U.S. is against Communist aggression anywhere and this helps South Korea
							against Communist aggression in the north. Kim said that in order to
							send more Korean troops, constitutional processes were required. He,
							personally, wants to send these additional forces and is not seeking any
							bargains. He needs the Secretary's support and cooperation to sell the
							Korean National Assembly on sending more troops. The problem is a
							sensitive one, for if the size of the Korean forces to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> is increased, the South Korean people
							worry about an increase in the ChiCom and North Korean threat. Also, any
							force reductions in U.S. or Korean force levels create domestic
							problems. Kim said he believed it necessary, if one <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> is sent to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, that an <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> cadre be
							formed in Korea and, likewise, if a Korean Division went to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should mobilize and put into training one division in
							Korea to maintain the image of force.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that Kim should talk to General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> about this. He said he doubted
							the need to replace an <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> or division
							sent to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, but he was not a military
							expert. He added that he would be surprised if the replacement of units
							was needed. Kim said such action was necessary to swing the Congress of
							Korea behind the idea of additional forces and this replacement of units
							was a way to do it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we have a strong commitment to Korea with the
							Mutual Defense Treaty. The U.S. will act and provide sufficient forces
							to fight. Further, we will recommend, advise, and assist on the proper
							level of forces needed by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. He said
							President Park made an important point this morning (18 May breakfast
								Park-<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>)<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">See <ref target="#d49">Document 49</ref>.</note>
							when he said that it is necessary for Korea to make economic progress to
							be strong. The Secretary added that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should not put into its military more force than is
							required; Korea must use its resources wisely. He said that he was
							inclined to feel there was not a requirement to have as large forces as
							Korea now has.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Military Transfer Program and Pay Raise.</hi> Kim said
							he felt that there should be an easing of the Military Transfer Program
							and that a pay <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0144"/>raise was
							essential. The Secretary said that we should remove any inequities in
							pay that existed between the military, civil service, and the civilians,
							and certainly take necessary steps to correct and improve conditions
							that were not satisfactory. We should undertake a joint study together
							in Korea on the pay problem and the actual requirements to be met. The
							Secretary replied that the Transfer Program should continue. He was
							willing to consider the Military Transfer Program in light of prevailing
							economic conditions, tax revenues, expenditures, and what is in the best
							interests of our two countries. He said Korea's economy is important,
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is not the place to solve the
							economic problems, and the Military Transfer Program helps the economy.
							We would like, therefore, to pursue the Transfer Program. It is
							important not to hold up a military pay raise and economic developments
							because of the Transfer Program. We will continue to keep the Transfer
							Program under study and look over the Program each year for adjustments
							if they become necessary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Excess Material</hi>. Kim asked
							for the Secretary's views on the transfer to Korea of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> excess material sale proceeds. (Koreans
							proposed proceeds of sales should go to Korea for barracks, and quarters
							since their budget and <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds are so
							austere.) The Secretary said that he had not seen the proposal. He would
							be glad to look into the proposal when it was received.</p>

							support in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The Secretary said that

                        <p>Kim said the problem was one of equity between Korea and Japan in

							economy.</p>
                        <p>Kim said Korea wants to have a U.S. procurement office in Seoul to help
							them compete with the Japanese who have such an office (Kim might be
							talking about U.S. Army Logistics Center Japan (USALCJ) <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0145"/>which services the Far East). The

                        <p>1271. 1. In courtesy call on President Pak he raised question of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat troops for <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, asking clarification whether number
							desired was regimental combat team as mentioned by Amb Lodge or division
							mentioned by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. I
							replied that question was one of timing. A division was wanted, but
							combat team was all that could be accommodated at first. Pak said he
							would ask Assembly for authority to send up to division, to avoid

							there might be some advantage in presenting Assembly with several

							justified in doing so to his face, I am afraid that I cannot share his
							easy optimism. To send 20,000 combat troops to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> is a major undertaking for any country. It certainly is
							for Korea. Many Koreans will have sincere doubts as to wisdom of such a
							course. The opposition will claim that at same time Pak is turning Korea
							over to Japanese economic domination under unsatisfactory settlement, he
							is also weakening Korean defenses and increasing Korean danger from
							Communist neighbors, thus confirming his irresponsibility and incapacity
							to govern.</p>
                        <p>How much force this will add to “extreme struggle” against Japan
							settlement already promised by opposition cannot be accurately
							appraised. That it will add something seems inescapable.</p>
                        <p>I would therefore be much happier in terms of our primary objective of

							react to the troop dispatch proposal as publicized in press which is now

							visit and program of Tokyo and <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
							negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Consequently I recommend that we seek to delay any further <gloss target="#t_GRVN1">GRVN</gloss> request at least long enough to

								48,700. (Ibid.)</note> Subject: Proposed reduction US force in
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>1. I have reviewed with General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> both the military and political implications of
							the proposed reduction of US army strength in Korea to 48,700 including
							transients. Three aspects of the problem are crucial to any decision,
							namely:</p>
                        <p>A. The effect of the reduction on the combat strength and effectiveness
							of the US forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>B. The need to restructure the Army in Korea if the contemplated
							reduction is carried out.</p>
                        <p>C. Whether the establishment of this level of forces and any
							restructuring that is carried out because of it will be construed by the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and the public as a weakening
							of Korea's defenses and a decrease in the US commitment to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. We are quite aware that the reduced force level would result in total
							strength (numbers) only about 3000 men below the average of the years
							1960–1963, and that for one brief moment of time in the past, which was
							a low point in the normal fluctuation of strength, the numbers here got
							down to the figure now proposed. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> is nonetheless convinced that, especially with the
							present structure, the 48,700 level would result in a combat
							effectiveness of the two US Army divisions in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of little more than 50 percent of the
							effectiveness contemplated by their tables of organization and taking
							into account Katusa augmentation. The full tables of organization and
							distribution of US units assigned to EUSA today call for 69,453 (present
							for duty—no transients included). A reduced effectiveness had in fact
							prevailed in the lean years 1960–1963, but the hope had been that
							strength could one day be improved to levels considered barely adequate
							to the present structure (i.e., about 55,000, including transients). As
							a result of strenuous and carefully documented representations made by
							General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> after becoming
							COMUS Korea in 1963, force levels were in fact brought up to this level
							in 1964.</p>
                        <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0148"/>
                        <p>3. The reduction of military capability involved in a permanent 48,700
							ceiling naturally gives me concern.</p>
                        <p>4. A decision to restructure might have been in order earlier, but the
							fact that force levels could, and occasionally did, rise to figures
							regarded as reasonably consistent with the existing structure, made it
							possible to postpone such a decision. If, however, a new and permanent
							lower ceiling is to be established, the question can no longer logically
							be avoided.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_HGHH1">Howze</persName> has documented
							to the Dept of Army the need for a restructuring if the force level is
							to be permanently at the new figure of 48,700 including transients.
							Basically his plan calls for the reduction of the 7th infantry to a
							brigade, and a beefing up of the 1st cavalry division. Some units of the
							7th infantry would be abolished and the spaces transferred to remaining
							combat units. In the process some compounds in the 7th division area
							would be deactivated, and the military port of Inchon would be closed
							except for the <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> terminal. The 1st
							cavalry would be strengthened as a result of these changes and the 7th
							division, though restructured as a brigade, would according to military
							opinion be stronger than it would be if its available manpower were
							scattered through a large number of units. Such changes are the logical
							corollary of a decision to limit the total numbers of personnel to a
							figure at which a number of presently organized combat units are badly
							below strength. To “retain both divisions at full structure and reduce
							manning levels” to proposed level as suggested in <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss> B would not be militarily sound
							and would provide in fact less military power than the 48,700 figure
							could actually provide.</p>
                        <p>6. So much for the military aspects of the situation. The political
							problem presented is more immediate. I do not need to repeat here the
							importance attached by all Koreans to the US military commitment to
							Korea and the maintenance of US forces here. To meet this concern many
							high level US officials, including Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and, most recently, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, have assured the Koreans of
							continued powerful US forces in Korea and of prior consultation should
							we decide to reduce our forces here.<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">In
								telegram 1372 from Seoul, June 24, the Embassy reported that the
								Korean Government seemed to suspect that U.S. troop strength was
								being reduced. According to an intelligence report, at least two
								local police stations were instructed to watch closely the military
								installations in their locality to determine and report any
								reductions of U.S. troops. In addition, each police station in an
								area having a U.S. military base was ordered to recruit an informant
								working on the base to acquire information about troop strength.
								That information would then be used to evaluate <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> policy toward furnishing additional
								troops to Vietnam. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. As the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and public were unaware
							of the buildup in 1964, the attrition to about 48,000 in March 1965, and
							the recent buildup, it <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0149"/>is quite
							possible that they can remain in ignorance of the further reduction to
							48,700 which is now proposed. This is however, not certain since the
							entire strength will now fluctuate around a lesser level.</p>
                        <p>8. To restructure in such manner as to use the 48,700 most effectively
							will certainly attract attention, and lead Koreans to the conclusion
							that the US is reducing its forces. Some of this can be countered. For
							example, closure of Inchon can be represented as part of a larger
							program to shift the 8th army's supply routes and logistic base to the
							Pusan/Taegu area. However, the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							would for purely operational reasons have to be told of the reduction of
							the 7th division to a brigade and will inevitably inquire as reasons for
							this restructuring.</p>
                        <p>9. I do not need to belabor the obvious point that this is no time to
							give the Koreans the impression that we are pulling out any troops. Nor
							do we want to give our free world allies or the Communists any such
								impression.<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">In telegram 166 to Seoul,
								August 12, the Department of State notified the Embassy of decisions
								made by the Secretary of the Army to reduce “US forces in Korea for
								gold-flow reasons.” The charges conformed to suggestions advanced by
								the <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> in Korea, namely, that troop
								levels would be maintained at 53,000 including transients and that
								Inchon would be used only for <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>.
								In addition, some Pershing missile units and medium-range
								helicopters would no longer be sent to Korea. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. Thus a permanent reduction to 48,700 level makes little military
							sense without restructuring, but to restructure will do major political
							damage in weakening the present govt when it needs all possible strength
							for the ratification of the settlement with Japan and to be able to make
							a further contribution of troops to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>11. The best solution from both the political and military viewpoint is
							to rebuild to approximately 55,000 including transients and maintain the
							present structure. With this we can maintain a reasonable military
							posture and avoid political problems.</p>
                        <p>12. A less satisfactory solution would be to reduce to about the average
							of the last 5 years, or 52,000, and struggle along with the present
							structure, hoping that by reduction of the proportion of transients we
							can keep our structure sufficiently filled to be reasonably effective
							militarily, and being able if questioned by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> about any deficiencies to say that there is no
							reduction from the average number we have had in the past.</p>
                        <p>13. A still less desirable solution, for reasons stated above, is to
							reduce to 48,700 and keep the present structure.</p>
                        <p>14. A final possibility (preferable from a purely military point of view
							to that in para 13) is simply to tell the Koreans about the reduction,
							point out that after it our force levels would be only a few thousand
							men below the mean level of 1960–1963, that restructuring will improve
								<pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0150"/>the effectiveness of the
							new number, and that with the present situation in South Vietnam this is
							the best we can do.</p>
                        <p>15. We should not contemplate this possibility at this time. No matter
							how presented by us, the headlines in Korea would be “US withdrawing its
							troops,” and the impact on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
							settlement and the prospect of further Korean troops for <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> would be highly adverse for obvious
							reasons.</p>
                        <p>16. I therefore recommend that for the next 6 months we adopt the first
							solution (para 11) or, as a last resort, the 2nd (para 12). The matter
							could then be reviewed in the light of circumstances then existing.</p>

                        <p>1. If Korea provides a combat division for <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> this will add a new dimension to our relationship.</p>
                        <p>2. Korea, a small country bordering on the Communist world, will be in
							actual combat in one of the most active areas of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> against Communist forces. It will have provided very
							substantially greater combat manpower than any other free world country
							great or small except the United States. This is a decision of great
							import for any country to make.</p>
                        <p>3. It comes at a rather crucial period for Korea, a sort of watershed in
							its current history. For if the settlement with Japan is ratified, as we
							hope it will be, a period of new relationships and new problems will
							begin which will provide great opportunities, but also problems the
							solution of which will tax all <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s
							capabilities and all our skill and understanding.</p>
                        <p>4. Tensions with the Communist world are heightening everywhere. This is
							no time to drop our guard. Rather we should accelerate our effort to
							build free world strength wherever opportunity offers.</p>
                        <p>5. At the moment trained combat manpower is a crucial need in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. It is fair to say to Korea that this
							battle is hers as well as ours, that she can afford the men, that it is
							her duty to return in some measure the help rendered her so unstintingly
							by the free world in the past, and that we will ensure that this will
							not involve her in extra cost.</p>
                        <p>6. But it is also a cold fact that Korea does not have to do this, that
							it does involve Korea in some additional risk, that a well-trained
							combat division can be a real contribution to the struggle, and that it
							can save us a great deal in blood and treasure.</p>
                        <p>7. This question is now about to be considered by the Assembly in an
							atmosphere which for a variety of reasons has become superheated and
							casts doubt upon the outcome. It is not just the opposition which is
							causing the trouble, but also many members of the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>. The question is mixed up with the
							feeling against Japan and the ever present haunting doubts about US
							support. The opposition, already in full cry on the ratification of the
							K–J settlement, is beginning to attack on the second front of the troop
							issue. Some members of the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> are
							accusing the govt of failure to get proper recompense from the US for
							what the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is prepared to do in
								<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. On top of this, public opinion
							has been inflamed by distorted reports that the US expects flesh and
							blood from Korea while concentrating its purchases of war materials in
							Japan to the advantage of that economy rather than the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. The question of a pay raise has become a current political issue in
							specific reference to the question of sending troops to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. This pay raise is unquestionably not
							only justified, but is essential if morale and efficiency in the armed
							forces and civil service is to be maintained. That it is long overdue is
							clear from the fact that the cost of living has <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0155"/>increased about 75 percent since pay
							was last adjusted. The 1966 budget, shortly to be presented to the
							Assembly, will have to deal with this question in some form. In every
							phase of service, military, govt, education, low pay is a drag upon
							progress and efficiency which the country can ill afford. Yet the cost
							is also great for it to afford.</p>
                        <p>9. A 75 percent pay raise plus the present <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer program would, for example, increase the
							military budget by about 35 percent.</p>
                        <p>10. I have devoted a lot of thought as to what we could do to meet this
							combination of political and economic problems in a way most consistent
							with our current economic strategy. We need a measure which will meet
							the political objections which the govt faces in seeking to send combat
							troops to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, which will contribute at
							least partially to the solution of the economic problems which the govt
							faces, which will recognize the real contribution which Korea will in
							fact be making, and which will be consistent with our aid policy and
							stabilization program.</p>
                        <p>11. There is a solution which meets all of these criteria and meets most
							of them dramatically, namely a suspension of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> funding requirement of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer program for so long as <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> maintains substantial forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> by means of US offshore procurement from Korea of those
							items now scheduled for transfer, upon the understanding that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> budgetary savings from this action be
							a contribution to a substantial military and civilian pay raise.</p>
                        <p>12. We cannot give preference to Korea in procurement for <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> as they want us to do, for reasons of
							law and principle. But we can meet political difficulties and show our
							appreciation without sacrifice of either by this adjustment of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer.</p>
                        <p>13. Such action would have a considerable effect. It would be represented
							by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> as a great political
							victory. It would go far to ensure united <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> support for despatch of a division to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. It would correct the adverse effects
							of the untimely release of the Poats and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> statements, which, however proper in their
							context, have caused untold political difficulties for us and for the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> here.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">The Korean Minister of National Defense obtained
								news reports quoting <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> as having said that Korea would bear the
								full 75 percent military pay increase and stating that Poats
								believed that Korea could easily shoulder $7 or $8 million in
								defense increases. News that the United States intended to purchase
								munitions from Japan for use in Vietnam also reached Korea.
								(Telegram 1390 from Seoul, June 29; ibid., DEF 19 US–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> It would be consistent with
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s promise to
							President Pak to review the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer
							program in the light of Korea's real economic needs. It would not
							finance all of a pay raise, but would help make a pay raise possible.
								<gloss target="#t_OSP1">OSP</gloss> of items programmed for transfer
							would continue the stimulation of local industry which we have so
							strongly <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0156"/>emphasized as
							important and would set the stage for budgetary transfer when the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is equal to the task. Korean dollar
							earnings would be increased. The stabilization and <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> policies would not be weakened.</p>
                        <p>14. Realize that this course will add something to our dollar outflow.
							But the amount pales into insignificance in comparison with the cost of
							sending a US division to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> instead of
							a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division.</p>
                        <p>15. Of course to suspend <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> transfer and
							still make good on our recent commitment (refs A and B) to increase
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active army divisions combat
							effectiveness and to bring 3 ready reserve divisions to full equipment
							levels, Korea <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funding must
							necessarily be further increased. But in my view this is a lesser evil
							than a reluctant despatch of the division or failure to send it at all,
							or indeed the loss of a substantial pay raise.</p>
                        <p>16. We may lose some face in yielding on a point on which we have for so
							long held firm. But the possibility of a change of view was established
							at the highest level during the Pak visit to Washington and we do have
							more facts and new circumstances. So this doesn't worry me.</p>
                        <p>17. I think a suspension of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							program is now both politically expedient and economically and
							militarily justified.</p>
                        <p>18. I therefore recommend that we agree to it and do so promptly, so that

                        <p>Over the last several months there has been considerable discussion

                        <p>In our general discussions with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							we have informed them that there is no possibility of granting Korea
							special preference for such procurement for both political and
							legislative reasons. We have also stressed that Korea should emphasize
							the development of permanent export markets rather than place too much
							emphasis on what is hopefully a temporary situation. At the same time,
							it is important for the U.S. to recognize the political and
							psychological attitudes within Korea on this question. Korea is
							providing a full combat division plus a non-combat engineering unit to
							Vietnam. While the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and the U.S.
							have repeatedly maintained that such action was based on Korea's
							understanding of its own interests in the war in South Vietnam and its
							responsibilities to the Free World, there is inevitably the feeling
							within Korea, and particularly in the Assembly, that Korea should
							receive some tangible trade benefits from its willing response to the
							request for troops. This feeling is fortified by the feeling that
							persists in Korea that Japan profited greatly economically from the
							Korean War. Korea now sees an opportunity to capitalize itself on the
							economic consequences of the Vietnam engagement. But equally important,
							Korea resents any implication that while Korea is contributing troops to
							the war, Japan may once again be making large profits through U.S.
							off-shore procurement.</p>
                        <p>In order to meet these problems, the U.S. has promised the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> that Korea will be given full and
							equal opportunity to compete for U.S. off-shore procurement whether
							military or civilian. Some steps have been taken in this regard, but
							others still remain to be implemented, and certain other recommendations
							in this area are still awaiting U.S. action.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Civilian:</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> recommended in April that Korea be
							made eligible for purchases under Supporting Assistance for Vietnam of
							tires and tubes which are currently restricted to U.S. procurement. This
							recommendation was made on the basis of Korean capability to produce
							tires and tubes of high quality, having supplied such products over the
							past several years to U.S. forces stationed here in Korea. Furthermore,
							Korea utilizes U.S. surplus rubber in its production of tires and tubes
							and thus the procurement in Korea would not represent entirely a gold
							drain. Finally, this industry is one which <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> has helped to develop and is one of the most competent
							and competitive industries in Korea. Action on this recommendation lies
							with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/W.</p>
                        <p>The second recommendation on civilian procurement, made in June, related
							to the 10% rule on steel products. The rule in question states that not
							more than 10% of an item purchased on a limited world-wide basis can be
							obtained from a non-eligible source of procurement. In the case of
							galvanized steel products from Korea, roughly 10% of the value of the
							final product is paid for with cash to Japan for certain interim
							processing with additional payment to Japan paid for with <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0159"/>scrap iron imported from the U.S. Thus
							while Japan contributes more than 10% of the total value of the finished
							product, only 10% is paid for in dollars and the remainder in U.S.
							purchased scrap. Our recommendation was that the U.S. interpret the 10%
							rule broadly enough to permit Korean exports of this product under the
								<gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> Vietnam program. This was not a
							waiver request, but a request for a broad interpretation which appears
							legitimate within the purposes for which the rule was established. This
							recommendation is important because Korean exports of galvanized steel
							to Vietnam have run as high as $13 million a year and steel has thus
							been one of Korea's chief exports to Vietnam. In addition, Korea
							manufacturers undertook long negotiations and paid an indemnity to
							Vietnam to reopen the market in Vietnam after a bad shipment caused the
								<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> to exclude Korean steel imports.
							To deny this market to Korea now would mean rendering past Korean
							efforts both in developing the market and in settling a difficult
							dispute useless. Action on this question is with <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss>/Saigon, which has been given
							discretionary authority by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>/W to
							resolve the matter.</p>
                        <p>We discussed with Washington the possibility of other types of civilian
							procurement in Korea, particularly the processing of PL 480 products for
							Vietnam and the purchase of textiles. Washington has informed us that
							such procurement is not feasible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Military:</hi> Korea has been informed that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
							funds can only be spent off-shore for emergency or other special reasons
							such as storage problems, substantial price differences, etc. In such
							cases, procurement must be completely competitive, and no preference can
							be granted. To meet Korean complaints about procurement in Japan, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has requested Japan, Vietnam and Korea
							to review procurement procedures and to determine whether Korea was in
							fact in a less advantageous position, because Korea was now receiving
							information on all orders for Vietnam and would in the future be
							receiving information on all U.S. procurement in the Far East for U.S.
							forces. However, to date while information on Vietnam procurement has
							been provided to the U.S. Army's Korean Procurement Agency, information
							on other military procurement of the Far East has not been so provided.
							While Korea may not be able to compete with Japan on certain
							sophisticated items, there is an important political and psychological
							importance in giving Korea completely equal opportunity to compete on
							all U.S. off-shore procurement in the Far East. Action on this matter
							lies evidently with U.S. Army's Japan Procurement Agency.</p>
                        <p>A second item of military procurement was in the use of Korean facilities
							of rehabilitation and repair of vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment,
							for which Korea was believed to have some very adequate facilities. Last
							spring, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> undertook to survey
							some of these facilities—on a priority basis—for use in connection with
								<pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0160"/>Vietnam. To date, however,
							nothing has been heard from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
							on this matter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Conclusion:</hi> Korea's hopes for large-scale exports
							to Vietnam, which have frequently been mentioned as high as $30 million
							a year, will largely be frustrated, particularly since off-shore
							procurement of most textiles, which represented over half of the value
							of items in the Korean planning, has been precluded by Washington under
							either U.S. forces or <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> procurement.
							This makes it all the more important that in those items in which Korea
							does have a legitimate right to compete, efforts should be made to
							provide Korea the necessary information and opportunities. Action on the
							tires and tubes and on the steel questions for example, would be most
							welcome. A determination of Korea's capability in repair and
							rehabilitation would also be important.</p>
                        <p>In addition, off-shore procurement by the U.S. for other than Vietnam
							should not discriminate against Korea and should in fact provide Korea
							with as much opportunity as possible. Particularly important in this
							area is the procurement for the U.S. forces stationed in Korea,
							including the purchases for the PX. This subject is dealt with in a
							separate paper which is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Attached

                        </p>
                        <p>I responded that we did believe that additional forces were required in
							1966 and that we were studying the extent of the need urgently. I made
							clear that no decisions or final evaluations had yet been made, so that
							I could not now say whether the question of additional Korean forces
							would be raised. I then went on to stress that, “when and if” we did
							come to believe that it would be useful to have additional Korean
							forces, we would take great care to see that the matter was raised
							personally with President Park before we did anything else.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0162"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Kim noted that his attaches in the Pentagon were picking up
							word that additional Korean forces were being envisaged in various plans
							for 1966. I said that we had contingency plans for a great many
							situations, but that their existence did not at all mean that the US
							Government had come to a firm decision. He also noted that there had
							been a certain amount of newspaper speculation and that he was getting
							inquiries whether Korea was planning to send “two divisions”. I told him
							that such speculation was virtually inevitable, although it did not do
							any good and we would do our best to prevent it. He expressed agreement
							that press speculation on the subject was not useful.</p>
                        <p>(Subsequent to my meeting with Ambassador Kim, I received from Deputy
							Assistant Secretary Friedman in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> his
							memorandum of a similar call by Ambassador Kim this morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d61fn3">Memorandum of conversation not found.</note> Mr.
							Friedman gave the same basic response that I did, except that he did not
							specifically say that we would take the matter up with President Park in
							the first instance if we did come to the view that additional Korean
							troops were needed. Mr. Friedman also elicited Ambassador Kim's personal
							view that any request for additional troops would probably be favorably
							received, but that it would have to be carefully handled to assure that
							it did not become a “political football” and that the Korean Government
							would have to be in a position to show its people more clearly the
							importance of the move to Korea. Ambassador Kim further volunteered that
							his Government might be thinking of one or two additional divisions, to
							make up a corps.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It was Mr. Friedman's conclusion from
							Ambassador Kim's responses that the Korean Government would be
							interested in very early discussions on this subject. Pending
							consultation with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, prior to his departure for Korea on Saturday, I
							am less sure of this conclusion. Ambassador Kim has a way of speaking
							for himself alone, and the message from Yi Hu Rak could be interpreted
							to mean that we should be very careful how we handle this and
							particularly careful to deal with President Park himself before the
							matter seemed to be a wide general assumption in the press or otherwise.
							However, the absence of any negative element in the Yi Hu Rak message
							does at least suggest that the Korean Government realizes that the
							matter is virtually sure to come up, and in this sense the message may
							argue for the possibility of an early request at least on a discreet
							basis.</p>

							to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. This afternoon I called on President Park and gave him a full
							exposition of our appraisal of the situation in South Vietnam, of our
							plans for augmentation of U.S. forces there, our efforts to get further
							contributions from Asian countries and their probable results, and asked
							his reaction to the possibility of the contribution of further Korean
							division by July and a brigade by October. I said that the U.S. would be
							prepared to see that the physical security of Korea would not be
							impaired by such a contribution and that no added economic burden be
							placed on Korea because of it.</p>
                        <p>2. The President said this was a matter which he would have to consider
							very carefully. It might perhaps be well, having once contributed combat
							forces, to add to that contribution and try to help get it over as soon
							as possible, but he had to consider the National Assembly,<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">

                        <p>627. Subject: Additional Korean Troops for South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CICI1">Chong Il-kwon</persName> raised this
							subject with me at lunch today, indicating he had discussed matter with
							President Pak and with Minister National Defense. He stated that
							President Pak, <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and he all agree that
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should send additional troops we
							had requested but that US help would be required in handling problems
							with political opposition and press that would arise when request became
							public knowledge. I questioned him closely with respect to
							authoritativeness of his statement, asking on three separate occasions
							whether this statement represented official response to my conversation
							with President Pak. On each occasion <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> responded in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>2. Conversation was devoted primarily to discussion of tactics for
							handling political problems. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
							said it would be essential, before troop request became public, that
							either Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> or Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> come to Korea for
							consultation with President Pak. He suggested about January 25 for such
							visit. He said visit needed to assure Korean public of continuing deep
							concern and support of US leadership for <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. Immediately following consultation Secretary could
							publicly reaffirm US support for Korea's security, point to concrete
							measures being taken by US to strengthen <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces (e.g., new equipment for divisions), assure
							public that modernization <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
							would continue and that <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program
							would not decrease in next two years or so, describe plans for
							augmentation US forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and
							express hope that Korea could make further troop contribution. (<gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> envisaged that in meantime favorable news
							could continue emanate from Washington and Saigon on US and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> procurement from Korea for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and augmentation Korean exports.)</p>
                        <p>3. Immediately following this announcement President would confirm
							request and convene National Assembly to present authorizing
							legislation, which it would have secretly prepared in advance. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said he anticipated legislation
							could be passed before President Pak departs February 7 on his Southeast
							Asian tour. He expressed view such hurried passage necessary to get
							legislation passed before public unrest develops during traditional
							period of food scarcity in late winter and before opposition and its
							press supporters could organize resistance <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0165"/>and mobilize student action. He thought President Pak
							would have no difficulty in keeping <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							in line, although he admitted some <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							members might make trouble.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said that he foresees two
							major political problems facing <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in
							coming months. One was the possibility of difficulties, particularly on
							economic aspects, with administration of Japan-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> agreements. These might give opposition and press
							opportunities to attack Pak government. Second was possibility that
							something might go wrong in Vietnam, where serious reverses could damage
							prestige of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. He therefore thought
							it essential that to extent possible effort be made to educate press and
							opposition assemblymen as to Vietnam situation and US determination
							before troop request made public. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said in this context he thought it would be
							extremely useful if the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could
							arrange and finance early visits to US and Vietnam by group of about 15
							key <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> and opposition assemblymen and
							to Vietnam by selected group of reporters and editorial writers. Those
							selected could report to Korean people on actual conditions in US and
							Vietnam, could be indoctrinated on need for additional forces in present
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> area of responsibility by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> commanders in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and could generally prepare way for acceptance troop
							request.</p>
                        <p>5. In response to foregoing I told him that it might be possible to have
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> visit Korea
							during last week of January<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> did not visit South
								Korea at this time. As part of a previously arranged trip to several
								Asian countries, Vice President Humphrey was scheduled to visit
								Seoul January 1–2, 1966. The Embassy advised that since the “request
								for additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops is now
								most important subject involving US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations” Humphrey should be prepared to discuss
								the subject when he met with Pak. The Department of State concurred.
								(Telegrams 628 from Seoul, December 22, and 623 to Seoul, December
								23; both ibid.)</note> and that we would see what we could do about
							arranging for visits to US and Vietnam by assemblymen and press people.
							With respect quid pro quo I gave him essentially same assurances I had
							given to President Pak but did not go into detail. I told him that US
							would be as forthcoming as possible and that we would expect detailed
							discussions of military aspects this subject would take place between
								<gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> as soon as <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> was ready to talk. I concluded this
							conversation by expressing deep appreciation on behalf of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and people for the response which he
							had given me.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I am not completely satisfied with
							this interview, particularly in view of fact that <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> has not mentioned this subject to
							General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>, although after
							his talk with Prime Minister, <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> had
							lengthy discussion with <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> on
							related subjects. This makes me feel it necessary to confirm personally
							with President Pak that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
                            <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0166"/>position is as stated by <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. This I will try to do morning
							December 24.</p>
                        <p>7. I also find it difficult to believe that things will go as smoothly as
								<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> seemed to indicate. For
							one thing it appears unlikely that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							would be able to push enabling legislation through National Assembly
							before President Pak's departure for Southeast Asia. Indeed <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> seemed to confirm this doubt when
							he later referred to possibility that assemblymen and newsmen might take
							suggested trips while President Pak was away. It is also clear that
							considerable hard bargaining with respect quid pro quo will ensue once
								<gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> gets into this act. On the
							whole, however, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s reply
							confirms our feeling that highest levels <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> wish to respond favorably to our request and that
							major problems will involve satisfying <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>'s demands on quid pro quo and minimizing public and
							political opposition to request when it is presented to National
							Assembly. These may be considerable.</p>
                        <p>8. For tactical reasons, I propose now to wait for approach from <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> to General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>, which I will try to get President to accelerate
							if I am able to discuss subject with him on Dec. 24, or if not, by
							raising matter again with Prime Minister, at latest Dec 27. Meanwhile,
							we are considering how we could assist with brain-washing operation on
							opposition and press which <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
							suggested and would appreciate any suggestions Department may offer.
							Would also appreciate soonest indication of whether it would be possible
							for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to
							schedule Seoul visit last week January.</p>

								discussion of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in Vietnam
								between U.S. Senator Stuart Symington and Pak. Pak expressed his
								satisfaction with the treatment and support given his troops and
								mentioned in general terms the possibility of additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> units being sent to Vietnam. Since
								the discussion of that issue was nonspecific, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> indicated his belief that no
								“compromise of secrecy with respect to our larger request was
								involved in the President's remarks.” Nevertheless, Symington was
								cautioned that the topic “should be handled as a matter of the
								highest classification.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. By previous arrangement I remained after the President's interview
							with Senator Symington and General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> reported <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>. I said to the President that the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had raised with me on Dec 22 the
							matter of an additional Korean division and brigade for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, which I had broached to the President
							on Dec 16. The <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had said that the
							President wished to send these forces if necessary arrangements for
							preserving Korea's security and satisfying Korean public opinion could
							be made. He had also said that the President felt if this was to be done
							it were best that it be done quickly, perhaps even before he left for
							his trip to Southeast Asia. Since this was so important a question, I
							wished to confirm that this was indeed the President's view and if so to
							ask him how to proceed further.</p>
                        <p>2. The President said the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had told him
							of our talk and had correctly reflected his views. If additional troops
							were to be sent it was best that they should be sent when they were
							needed and not after long, drawn-out delays. To make this possible, many
							things would have to be done by his govt and a number of things by the
							US.</p>
                        <p>3. I said that I recognized this and repeated that our request had been
							made on the basis that the physical security of Korea would not thereby
							be impaired and that no additional economic burden would thereby be
							imposed. The President nodded. I realized that this would involve a
							number of practical arrangements which would have to be worked out. The
								<gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> was leaving for Manila on the 28th
							and would not be back until the first. How would the President
							contemplate that we should get on with necessary arrangements?</p>
                        <p>4. The President said that the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had
							doubtless issued the necessary instructions to the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and perhaps we should get in touch with
								<pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0168"/>him. I said that at any
							time the Minister of National Defense notified us that he was ready to
							talk, we would be prepared to do so. I therefore suggested the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> inform General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> as soon as he was ready to begin
							discussion. General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> was
							prepared to respond immediately and the sooner we received this word
							from the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> the better. The President
							agreed that we should proceed in this fashion.</p>
                        <p>5. I told the President that this action on his part would be deeply
							appreciated in [garble—US?] and closed discussion with a heartfelt
							“Thank you,” to which he responded with a shy and friendly “Merry
							Christmas.”</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The entire second part of this
							interview lasted less than ten minutes. The President was calm, sober
							and laconic. Indeed, it struck me as remarkable that a matter of such
							moment should be dealt with so calmly.</p>
                        <p>7. It is unmistakably clear, however, from what the President said and
							from the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'s earlier comments that they
							have genuine concern, both about the physical security of Korea and
							about what the Korean people will think about that security. It is
							important to them (and I think to us, also) that they secure the
							necessary Assembly approval, not by just a bare majority or a straight
							party vote after bitter debate and genuine doubts, but with the
							reasonable support and consensus of a satisfied public opinion. Indeed,
							as a conscientious President he could take no other position and it is
							doubly important for him personally with an election coming up.</p>
                        <p>8. The next move is up to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and I
							tried to arrange it that way because I think it is better
							psychologically for <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> to be coming to
							us, particularly since I have twice established with the President the
							fundamental basis upon which we approach this negotiation. We know that
								<gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> has established a secret noforn
							task force to consider this matter. If General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> does not hear from <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> in a few days I will raise the matter
							again, but will apply the needle, not to <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>, but to the Blue House or to the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. I am aware of General Westmoreland's and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s strong desire for the arrival of any new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> contingents before the dates of July
							and October contained in my original proposal to the President. I
							suggest, however, that we do not raise this question yet, but in the
							light of the President's and <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'s stated
							feelings that this matter should be dealt with promptly, bring up the
							need for earlier deployment at the negotiating level when discussions
							have developed an agreed basis upon which the troops can be sent.</p>

                        <p>656. Troops for Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. The Prime Minister told me evening December 27 that he had just come
							from meeting with President, <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>,
							Minister of National Defense, Foreign Minister and Yi Hu-rak, in which
							requirements from U.S. necessary to make possible reinforcement Korean
							troops in Vietnam were formulated. Memorandum will be prepared and
							handed to me in next day or two by Foreign Minister, who will conduct
							subsequent negotiations. Prime Minister will check on progress of
							discussions after Vice President's visit.</p>
                        <p>2. I said that I recognized certain things would have to be done by U.S.
							and the sooner we received the memorandum the better. I repeated that
							the basis upon which we were proceeding was no impairment of Korean
							security and no economic burden for Korea.<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">Proposals exchanged by the Department of State, the Country Team in
								Seoul, and <gloss target="#t_COMUSKOREA1">COMUSKOREA</gloss>
								examining the needs and costs involved in accomplishing those goals
								are ibid.</note> The <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said
							that he and the President wanted very much to be helpful, but they had
							problems with Korean Assembly and public.</p>
                        <p>3. I asked if President was still thinking of time table which <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had outlined (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 627).<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">
                                <ref target="#d63">Document 63</ref>.</note> He replied that
							President had not decided on time table and could not do so until he saw
							what arrangements could be made with U.S.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said President was thinking
							of asking Assembly for authorization in general terms to increase or
							decrease troops in South Vietnam without specifying numbers.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> added that Foreign Minister
							had assured the President that he would be “a very tough bargainer” in
							these negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment.</p>
                        <p>6. Additional troops issue has thus now become matter of formal
							inter-government negotiation, including economic and political, as well
							as purely military matters. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s are
							reserving commitment until they see what they can get. <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> strategy will doubtless be to get as
							broad commitments from U.S. as possible before getting down to military
								<pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0170"/>details, and <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi Tong-won</persName> will doubtless try to
							maintain reputation of “giant killer” which he has built up in
							negotiations with Japanese.</p>
                        <p>7. I anticipate rather confused situation, for a while at least, in view
							personalities involved and <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi
								Tong-won's</persName> ignorance of matters economic and military. We
							will just have to play this by ear and will know more when we see the
							memorandum. It will be real advantage to us if <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> makes opening gambit.</p>
                        <p>8. In any event it appears that things are moving seriously on the Korean
							side.</p>

								December 17, the Department of State presented, among other things,
								the proposed commitments the United States was willing to make to
								Korea, should additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces
								be deployed to Vietnam. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. As is evident already from my talks with the President and the Prime
							Minister, the main problem facing them in acceding to request for more
							troops will be the creation of a favorable climate of opinion in Korean
							Assembly, press and public.</p>
                        <p>2. U.S. attitude and even more important, U.S. actions, will inevitably
							exert a strong formative influence, one way or the other, on this
							climate.</p>
                        <p>3. Our overriding purpose is to get additional troops and, almost equally
							important, to get them with as solid a basis of Korean national support
							as possible. It would not be good for us or for our cause, for example,
							if these troops were sent by a narrow margin of Assembly approval after
							bitter debate and in the face of serious press and public criticism or
							even serious doubt.</p>
                        <p>4. There are many ways in which we can make our formative influence
							helpful. Some of these are large scale and dramatic, e.g., increased
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support, public statements by
							very high level U.S. <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0171"/>officials.
							But the cumulative effect of a series of smaller actions, or avoidance
							of action, especially in areas which are currently the focus of Korean
							public interest, can have an equal and, in some instances, a more solid
							and perhaps even greater beneficial influence.</p>
                        <p>5. If for example, over the next few weeks and months there should be a
							series of favorable procurement actions for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, or increased export to U.S. or new DLF loan approvals,
							or a better textile quota, or avoidance of bad news on use of
							counterpart, even in relatively small amounts in each case, the
							psychological effect here would be very constructive.</p>
                        <p>6. Most helpful at the moment would be a demonstration of U.S. good faith
							by early arrival of substantial quantities of the military equipment for
							the three ready reserve divisions (particularly fighting items) which
							was promised the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> when it agreed to
							send the Tiger division to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Delay in
							these deliveries has already been the subject of anxious <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> questions.</p>
                        <p>7. Much is already being done, e.g., <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
							procurement mission, and this has already been helpful. It nevertheless
							seems to me that we should for the next few months look at every action
							affecting Korea proposed by any part of our government in terms of its
							contribution to, or detraction from, the service of this main objective,
							and how, if possible, such action or inaction can be made to serve, or
							be kept from hurting, the achievement of that objective. A current small
							case in point can be found in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
								626.<note n="3" xml:id="d66fn3">In telegram 626 from Seoul, December
								22, the Embassy discussed upcoming talks regarding the renewal of a
								contract between the Department of Defense and the Korea Oil
								Corporation to supply <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-financed
									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> to meet Korean military
								requirements. (Ibid., DEF 19–8 US–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> Another is the “unfunding” of U.S. won
							accounts (a purely technical matter) which has resulted in a sudden and
							complete cessation for December of dollar receipts from won conversion
							for U.S. military and has elicited strongest representations from the
								<gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> today.</p>
                        <p>8. We are establishing necessary machinery here to try to forward this
							purpose and hope Washington can do likewise.</p>
                        <p>9. I would like to add that if the Koreans make this further troop
							contribution, it will be utterly impossible for them to understand why
							there can be no preferred treatment for them in matters economic,
							especially as they relate to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. They
							will be making a contribution in the irreplaceable commodity of human
							life, and doing so on a scale utterly disproportionate to the
							contributions of their competitors, particularly Japan. In such case the
							assurance of equal treatment with these competitors seems small
							recompense.</p>

                        <p>10. It seems to me that we are being faced with a political and human
							problem directly related to a bloody war in which we are deeply
							committed, to the solution of which our normal rules of commercial
							policy and peacetime procurement must also make their contribution.</p>

								in the amount of $29 million. The Department of State also reported

								(National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. During call on Foreign Minister related to other matters, he
							volunteered that he had discussed with President our request for
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. The President's reaction was
							favorable. But there were many problems about which the President had
							consulted with the Deputy Minister and Foreign Minister, who were
							considering what advice to give him.</p>
                        <p>2. He then made three points:</p>
                        <p>(A) It has been less than two months since the first full <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> combat division arrived in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and less than six months since the
							matter had last been discussed in a divided Assembly. This was a very
							short time in which to present another such proposal to the Korean
							people.</p>
                        <p>(B) The issue of troops for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> had been
							somewhat overshadowed in Assembly debate by emotion surrounding
							settlement with Japan. When it came before Assembly again it would stand
							out alone as an issue. The opposition, which is currently totally
							disorganized, is trying <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0173"/>to make
							a comeback and regain the face which it lost in the struggle over the
							ratification of the Japan treaty. It was likely to seize upon the
							question of further troops as a major issue, since opposition members
							felt strongly that only way they can keep themselves together is to have
							an issue on which to fight the majority.</p>
                        <p>(C) Many Koreans felt that Korea had already made its full and proper
							contribution to South Vietnamese war. Every Korean felt that Korea's
							contribution is vastly greater than that of any other free Asian
							country. Contributions of men from other Asian countries, even in small
							amounts, would be helpful and perhaps necessary.</p>
                        <p>3. The FonMin said he wanted it clear that President Pak's policy was to
							support the US and that he and the FonMin felt that the war in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> was theirs as much as ours. But the
							President had to deal with a practical domestic political problem.
							Questions of timing, presentation, etc., would be of paramount
							importance. Although the President's mood was favorable, the Cabinet
							members who knew about it, plus <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim
								Chong-pil</persName>, who was also being consulted, were not united
							in their opinion. In response to a specific question as to <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil's</persName> attitude, he declined
							to indicate who thought what.</p>
                        <p>4. I pointed out the importance of early decision, since the struggle was
							urgent and many physical preparations had to be made in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and elsewhere which depended on the
							number and character of the troops which would be available. Equipment
							had to be ordered, etc., all of which involved long lead time.</p>
                        <p>5. FonMin said he and <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> were
							considering this problem very seriously and he wanted to discuss it with
							me, but specifically asked that he be given a little time. “I assure you
							that I will get in touch with you. I have not disappointed you yet” he
							said.</p>
                        <p>6. I plan as our next move to suggest to Vice President Humphrey that he
							underline with President Pak the personal interest of President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and sense of urgency
							about this matter. I understand Vice President is prepared to do this. I
							will follow up with a specific request to President, in Vice President's
							presence, for negotiation action by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>In my discussions with President Park of the Republic of Korea, I was
							told that there had been undue delay in the provision of military
							assistance during the past year. Furthermore, there was a grave shortage
							of spare parts. I was further informed that much of the equipment,
							radar, field pieces, anti-aircraft guns and rifles were of World War II
							vintage and in a serious state of disrepair. This same message was given
							to me by the military authorities during my inspection of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops.</p>
                        <p>I am not in a position to judge the accurateness of this complaint, but I
							do pass it along for your information and respectfully suggest that an
							inquiry be made at the Defense Department. If there is delay, then
							indeed someone should expedite the shipment of the necessary equipment
							and parts.</p>
                        <p>There was grave concern in the government circles of Korea that we would
							be sharply reducing military assistance at the very time that Korea was
							taking a more active role in Vietnam. The President and the Prime
							Minister of Korea made a strong plea for offshore procurement from Korea
							to supply forces in Vietnam. They emphasized first of all that all
							offshore purchasing for the Korean forces in Vietnam should be made from
							Korea. They also requested that a sizable portion of offshore
							procurement for other forces in Vietnam be obtained through Korean
							sources. Both the President and the Prime Minister and other Cabinet
							officials expressed concern that the United States might do most of its
							offshore purchasing from Japan. I assured the Korean officials that
							these observations would be brought to your attention. The report of Mr.
							Valenti as to my conversations with President Park and the Prime
							Minister relates in more detail the substance of the Korean position on
							procurement and its relationship to additional Korean forces in
								Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">Dated January 2. (Ibid., Office

                        <p>1. FonMin this morning told Ambassador that at very high level meeting
							which President attended <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> had
							decided to postpone <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> signing. Sole
							reason for decision, according FonMin, is <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> concern lest consideration of <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> by Assembly about same time as request for additional
							troops for Vietnam be exploited by opposition and <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> dissidents so as to jeopardize chances
							of approval of latter.<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2">In a January 11
								meeting the Foreign Minister told <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> that the signing would be postponed because
								the “time was not ripe for introducing measure to National Assembly
								prior to President Pak's <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> trip
								scheduled to begin about Feb. 7.” <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> also learned prior to that meeting that the

								(<gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> and President Pak appear to
							believe it is politically necessary and feasible for Korea to absorb

							economy faster.</p>
                        <p>(Director emphasized that development programs and external resources in
							prospect for next several years are roughly at maximum that can be
							absorbed without negative effect.) <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>
							said there was much discontent over unemployment and poverty and people
							expected government to do more to reduce these problems faster. Said he
							considered assistance of two kinds desirable: (1) accelerating foreign
							exchange earnings, (2) accelerating capital goods inflow. At one point
							he also <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0181"/>referred to need for
							more active U.S. role in meeting domestic capital requirements than was
							in prospect for next number of years, reiterating that he did not
							advocate more supporting assistance for this purpose, <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> felt it needed to seize opportunity
							that Vietnam situation offered to increase these types of help for
							accelerated economic growth, having in mind stimulus Korean War provided
							to Japanese economy. <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> also argued
							U.S. should use this opportunity to give Korean economy last big push it
							needed to get over the hill. Then, he said, we can be stronger than
							North Korea. He cited Vice President Humphrey as saying Korea may get
							extra help if it sends troops to Vietnam. In responding to query re
							status of proposals in <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> view,
								<gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> said <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> needed to consider the Korean realities and U.S. its
							own realities in reviewing proposals, leaving implication that list was
							a bargaining tactic.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> called Blue House during session
							to arrange meeting with President to report negative U.S. reaction. He
							called director afterwards to confirm that submission should be regarded
							as a list of suggestions for U.S. to consider. <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> suggested talks adjourn until January 17 (i.e., after
							his return from Saigon trip). We agreed.</p>
                        <p>7. Meanwhile, we are responding by paper stating that our concept is
							preservation integrity Korean security and avoidance new economic burden
							plus some modest “plus”, and setting forth initial offer included <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 703 just received plus “best

							and willingness explore any projects submitted by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, including those specifically
							referred to in their paper, for DLF financing in context <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>-Pak communique of May 20, 1965.
							We are including promise to replace brigade as well as division, as we
							consider this both necessary for security and omission this assurance

                        <p>735. Subj: Korean Troops for Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. In course of wide-ranging conversation with <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> January 14 Presidential Secretary Yi Hu-rak had number
							of interesting things to say about how Korean Govt views U.S. request
							for additional Korean forces to be sent to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> said U.S. request for
							additional division and brigade had come as something of a shock to
							President. President, <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> said, was
							quite proud of his prompt and effective response to U.S. earlier
							request, speed with which Tiger division and Blue Dragon regiment were
							despatched to Vietnam and disciplined and courageous performance of
							forces in Vietnam. According to <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName>
							President never expected to be confronted with another request so soon.
							However he responded affirmatively out of friendship for President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and a strong feeling
							of loyalty to U.S. engendered during his state visit to Washington last
							May. At same time he had grave misgivings about Korean public reaction
							to being asked so soon for such a heavy additional contribution. In
								<persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName>'s own words President feels
							that despatch of additional forces requested will “overload Korea” but
							he is anxious to comply if politically feasible.</p>
                        <p>3. With such mixed attitude <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> said
							President feels he has to proceed cautiously and only after taking
							careful political soundings. President not only wants to be sure that
							Korean public will not feel they are being asked to do too much. He also
							thinks it important to be able to represent and defend Korean's
							involvement in Vietnam as clearly in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s own interest.</p>
                        <p>4. President feels, according to <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName>, that it is in interest of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to oppose communism anywhere in East Asia. In his own
							view this is sufficient justification for Korean intervention in Vietnam
							provided that intervention does not endanger security of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and does not impose an economic burden.
							However President does not feel such justification will be sufficient in
							presenting matter to National Assembly. Average Korean does not really
							see war in Vietnam as direct threat to security of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. On contrary he believes diversion of
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to Vietnam weakens
							defenses of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> while at same time
							inviting retaliation from <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>north. To overcome this probable reaction to despatch of any further
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to Vietnam President
							feels he will have to be able to demonstrate in National Assembly that
							there are corollary and significant benefits to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. These corollary benefits should meet two conditions. They should be
							easy to explain to Korean public as flowing directly from Korean
							involvement in Vietnam and they should be large enough to convince
							Koreans that U.S. properly appreciates sacrifices that Korean people are
							making to assist in Vietnam. <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName>
							then cited as an example question of death and disability benefits.
							Korean people would not be able to understand he said if U.S. was stingy
							in matter of death and disability benefits. U.S. would have to be
							prepared to be extremely generous in matter of death and disability
							benefits for those Koreans killed or wounded in action.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> concluded this portion of
							conversation by reminding <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> that
							sixty-six was an election year. <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName>
							said that he was fairly confident that President would be reelected in
							sixty-seven if all went well, particularly, in view of weakened and
							divided state of the opposition party. President was however worried
							that opposition to despatching additional troops to Vietnam would
							snowball and become issue around which opposition leaders could rally to
							attack government and possibly have a decisive effect on election
							outcome.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We believe <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> who is close to President Pak was expressing with
							reasonable accuracy how President assesses problem presented by our
							latest request for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops. Question
							remains when he will be able to take final decision. Judgement as to
							public and political reaction can probably be made over course of three
							weeks remaining before Pak leaves for Southeast Asian trip, since
							possibility of additional troop despatch gradually becoming known and
							will be hinted at in Pak's opening address to National Assembly next
							week. Whether and when terms and amount of support U.S. willing to offer
							“in appreciation” will seem sufficient to Pak will depend on progress of
							current negotiations which are still in opening phase. With positions
							two sides far apart, we are exerting every effort to get favorable
							decision before Pak leaves on trip and will let you know as soon as
							possible what we believe will be necessary to get it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> feels that we have now progressed as
							far as we can in separate discussions with <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>. FonMin reports
							that both are dissatisfied and are advising President that US responses
							to date inadequate to justify favorable decision. President, <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>
							and FonMin are leaving Feb 7 for two weeks and target dates of April and
							July for arrival of new forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
							are receding rapidly. Time has therefore now come to try to bring matter
							to a head and seek decision from President who basically favorable and
							is neither accurately nor objectively informed by either <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. It is unnecessary to elaborate theme that this early request for
							doubling <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, coupled with fact that acceding to it
							will, at best, involve some temporary degradation present <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength at home (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 703 para 2),<note n="8" xml:id="d73fn8">In paragraph 2 of telegram 703 to Seoul, January 8,
								the Department of State instructed <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to explain to Korean officials that by meeting
								the U.S. objective of sending a brigade by April and a division by
								July to Vietnam “it may be necessary for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to accept some temporary lessening of TE of the
									<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active forces in Korea until
								shipments of equipment and supplies can reach Korea for the
								activation of reserve units, the reconstitution of support and
								service elements, and the reconstitution of ready reserve units.”
								The United States would, however, provide the needed equipment as
								soon as possible. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27
								VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> presents President Pak
							with genuine political problem which we must help him meet.</p>
                        <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0185"/>
                        <p>3. We feel that a definitive offer should now be presented. If there is
							to be any chance of favorable decision even by President Pak before Feb
							7, it should be as generous as possible. Our concept of that offer is
							set forth in draft letter to FonMin (Ref F), as supplemented by General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>'s letter to <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> of Jan 18 (Ref D encl).</p>
                        <p>4. This offer will involve solid amounts of money. Amounts so paid here,
							however, are as directly spent for the prosecution of the war in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> as those spent for maintenance of our
							own forces there. But for categories of accounting they would be charged
							to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and would be swallowed up in the
							cost of that great effort. In any event, if we are to get an extra
							division and brigade we must be prepared to pay for them. The amounts
							involved, while substantial, are small in comparison with the cost of
							doing the job ourselves.</p>
                        <p>5. I propose to hand this offer to the Foreign Minister, if and as soon
							as you approve it, hopefully early next week, stressing stakes involved
							and need for early <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> decision, before
							President leaves if possible. While chances of President's submitting
							matter to Assembly before he leaves on Feb 7 is diminishing as each day
							passes, it would be very desirable to get favorable decision by
							President before Feb 7 in order to permit necessary military planning to
							proceed within government during his absence.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s may well come back with assertion
							that they need more. As a fall-back position <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> recommends that we be prepared, if it will clinch the
							deal, to add a 25 percent increase in per diem for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. Would appreciate Washington approval soonest, so we can expedite
							decision here.<note n="9" xml:id="d73fn9">In telegram 758 to Seoul,
								January 22, the Department concurred with most of the Embassy's
								recommendations. The major points of divergence involved the amount
								of death and disability payments to be paid and a potential increase
								of 25 percent in the per diem rate paid to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops serving in Vietnam. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. Foreign Minister called in Ambassador Jan 21 to discuss progress troop
							negotiations. He stated both <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and
								<gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> dissatisfied at what they
							consider lack of progress and failure to get anything from US but “vague
							assurances and things already certain”. They do not feel they have
							enough on which to face Assembly.</p>
                        <p>2. FonMin asked if need for further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							units was really urgent—things were quieter in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and large US reinforcement had arrived. It might be
							well to have a pause in the negotiations to allow the Korean negotiator
							to “save face.”</p>
                        <p>3. Amb reiterated urgency need, and said FonMin clearly not fully
							informed on magnitude and specificity US offers. If these offers were
							presented as the positive contribution which they are, instead of being
							disparaged, they could have highly persuasive effect on Assembly. FonMin
							could expect definitive offer early next week which would further
							clarify US position and should enable <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> then to make its decision.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is of course part of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> pressure on us for larger

							attitude with President is probably factual.</p>

							are now at the point where Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> will submit almost immediately a negotiating

							return in mid-February from a trip to Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The negotiating letter is within the authority the various Washington

							requests. Among the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> items, two
							require your action:</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> request for increased overseas

                            <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> Kim has pressed hard for a 100%
							increase. This would increase the annual cost of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop allowances in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>
							by $24 million to total of $48 million (either <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> or Service-funded, depending upon disposition of
							pending legislative proposals). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> agree to hold the line on this issue for the time
							being in the letter to be submitted to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, but state that they require fall-back authority to
							accept a 25% increase ($6 million annually).</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you authorize our acceding to the 25% increase but that
							we withhold giving Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> this authority until a point in the negotiations

                            <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> Kim has requested about $65 million

								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> recommend that we consider
							adding to the previously authorized “modernization” package ($10 million
							in each of <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>66 and <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>67) items costing $6.88 million as

                        <p>(1) One DD ($3.24 million);</p>
                        <p>(2) Six 155 mm howitzers and prime movers ($0.09 million);</p>
                        <p>(3) Armored bridge launch vehicle ($.81 million);</p>
                        <p>(4) One assault transport ship ($1.02 million);</p>

							($1.72 million).</p>
                        <p>I <hi rend="italic">recommend</hi> that you authorize an increase in the
								<gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>67 Korea <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for the <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-2A aircraft,
							the 105 howitzers and the bridge launch vehicle. These items appear to

                        <p>3. Text of approved letter follows:</p>
                        <p>“We have now had very useful discussions and exchanges of ideas on the
							question of the conditions under which additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces might be dispatched to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> with yourself, the Deputy Prime
							Minister, and the Minister of National Defense. I think that we now
							understand more clearly your concerns in this matter and that the time
							has come to bring the threads of the matter together so that you will be
							able to make your decision.</p>
                        <p>The basic considerations were enunciated by President Park in his talks
							with Vice President Humphrey and myself.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0190"/>
                        <p>These are that the integrity of Korea's defense should not be impaired
							and that no new economic burden should be imposed upon Korea. It was
							also agreed that there should be some net benefit to Korea for the
							deployment of these extra forces.</p>
                        <p>Our proposals for dealing with these basic considerations are contained
							in my memorandum to the Foreign Minister of January 12 and General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>'s letter to the
							Minister of National Defense of January 18.<note n="8" xml:id="d76fn8">Neither found, but their contents are summarized below.</note> As a
							result of our further discussions we are now able to make these
							proposals somewhat more precise and to add somewhat to them. The
							proposals in these two memoranda are still valid. Rather than repeat
							them in detail I will sum up what the United States is prepared to do as
							follows:</p>
                        <p>A.1. To equip as necessary and finance all additional won costs of the
							additional forces deployed to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A.2. To pay overseas allowances to these forces at the scale now being
							paid the Tiger Division, which, as you know, is as much as thirty times
							that currently being paid <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in
							Korea even after the recent pay raise and approximately four times the
							pay of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> troops. It covers all their
							expenses and has allowed for substantial remittances.</p>
                        <p>A.3. To provide death, wounded-in-action, and disability gratuities
							resulting from casualties in Viet-Nam at double the rates recently
							agreed by the Joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
							committee as being fully appropriate.</p>
                        <p>A.4. To equip, train, and finance complete replacement of the additional
							forces deployed to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A.5. To provide communications facilities for exclusive <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> use, the character of which is to be
							agreed between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials in
							Seoul and Saigon. These facilities will meet requirements for
							communicating with your forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.
							In addition, to provide 4 C–54 aircraft to the ROKAF for support of your
							forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A.6. To provide over the next few years substantial items of equipment
							for the modernization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in
							Korea on the basis set forth in General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>'s letter of January 18 to the Minister of National
							Defense.</p>
                        <p>A.7. To provide for the improvement of military barracks and military
							sanitation facilities from proceeds of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> excess sales as set forth in General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>'s letter of January 18 to the
							Minister of National Defense.</p>
                        <p>A.8. To contribute to filling the requirements determined by the two
							governments to be necessary, following completion of a joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> study, for the improvement of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> anti-infiltration
							capability.</p>
                        <p>A.9. To provide equipment to expand the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Arsenal for increased ammunition production in Korea.
							These undertakings, together with those already made in connection with
							dispatch of the Tiger Division to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>
							and backup provided <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0191"/>by the
							general U.S. commitment to Korea's defense, will fully meet the need for
							maintaining the security of Korea.</p>
                        <p>B. To avoid new economic burdens for Korea, the United States is
							prepared, in addition to paying all overseas expenses of the units to be
							deployed and the allowances referred to above, to release additional won
							to the Korean budget equal to all of the net costs of the deployment of
							these extra forces and of mobilizing and maintaining in Korea the
							activated reserve division and brigade and support elements. Thus, the
							deployment will involve no extra costs to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> budget and will involve large benefits in foreign
							exchange through troop remittances and payment of gratuities.</p>
                        <p>C. To provide a substantial net benefit to the Korean economy the U.S. is
							prepared additionally:</p>
                        <p>C.1. To suspend <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer Program for
							as long as there are substantial <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							forces, i.e. at least two divisions in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, with off-shore procurement in Korea in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 of items suspended in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 66 plus those on the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67 list. This will provide substantial
							budgetary relief and foreign exchange earnings for Korea. Regarding
							off-shore procurement, the United States Government will review this
							matter and make a further determination for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 68 at an appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>C.2.A. To procure in Korea insofar as practicable requirements for
							supplies, services and equipment for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and to direct to Korea
							selected types of procurement for U.S. and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> forces in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> in cases
							in which:</p>
                        <p>I. Korea has production capability,</p>
                        <p>II. Korea can meet specifications and delivery schedules,</p>
                        <p>III. It may be reasonably determined that Korean prices are fully
							competitive with other possible sources in the Far East, and</p>
                        <p>IV. The procurement conforms to <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> gold
							flow regulations. Supplies, services and equipment which meet this
							definition will be listed on a ‘natural source' list from which
							procurement will be made exclusively from Korean sources without
							soliciting bids from non-Korean producers.</p>
                        <p>C.2.B. To procure in Korea, in competition only with U.S. suppliers, as
							much as Korea can provide in time and at a reasonable price, a
							substantial amount of goods being purchased by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> for use in its project program for rural construction,
							pacification, relief, logistics, and so forth, in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. Payment for such goods will be by
							special letters of credit which tie these earnings to purchases in the
							U.S. Special regulations have already been adopted to permit commercial
							importation into <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> of galvanized iron
							sheets processed in Korea with <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
							funds.</p>
                        <p>C.2.C. To the extent permitted by <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, to
							provide Korean contractors expanded opportunities to participate in
							construction projects undertaken by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
							and American contractors in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and to
							provide other services. Korean contractors have already demonstrated
							competitive ability in these fields. Additionally, parallel employment
							of skilled Korean civilians in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> can
							provide sizeable foreign exchange earnings.</p>
                        <p>C.3. To increase its technical assistance to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in the general field of export promotion.</p>
                        <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0192"/>
                        <p>C.4. To provide <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loans over and above
							the $150 million figure agreed in May 1965 as suitable projects are
							developed subject to the same considerations which apply to the $150
							million commitment.</p>
                        <p>C.5. If justified by performance under the 1966 stabilization program,
							and subject to further review in Washington, to provide [$]15 million of
							program loans in 1966, which can be used for the support of exports to
								<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> and for other development needs. </p>
                        <p>We believe, Mr. Minister, that these proposals and assurances are not
							only fair, but generous, and should provide the basis for an effective
							presentation to the Korean people. We hope that on this basis the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will be prepared to dispatch an
							additional brigade to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> in April and a
							division force commencing in July 1966. I need not stress that the
							matter is urgent and the stakes very high, for Korea as well as the Free
							World.”</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Your concern with respect to the
							possibility that procurement to be placed in Korea might not be
							substantial is fully understood here. Apparently the volume of
							procurement presently coming from the U.S. Army Procurement Agency is
							not substantial. However, from present planning information available
							here, we are confident that the amount of procurement which can be
							placed in Korea in the future as a result of the proposed “natural
							source listing” will, in fact, be substantial. In any event it is not
							possible to make specific commitments as to dollar volume until the
							necessary “natural source” list has been developed and reviewed here. We
							strongly urge that list be submitted soonest. In compiling list, it is
							important to provide a “general order of magnitude” estimate of the
							quantity or dollar volume of production expected to be within the
							capability of Korean industry to produce for export to <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. [End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.]</p>
                        <p>5. Regret we unable authorize twenty-five percent increase in per diem
							rates or additional $6 million modernization add-ons (ref D, paras 1a
							and 1d).<note n="9" xml:id="d76fn9">The text of the letter was slightly

                        <p>1. I met with <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi Tong-won</persName> morning
							February 1. He announced immediately that his govt had decided “in
							principle” to accept the proposals contained in our letter of January
								29.<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">When <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> presented the letter contained in <ref target="#d76">Document 76</ref>, the Korean Foreign Minister's
								response seemed promising. (Telegram 800 from Seoul, January 29;
								National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Discussions between Embassy and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials over the next few days,
								however, led <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> and
								members of his staff to believe that the Koreans were “nearing
								decision but hoping to go on squeezing out more concessions right up
								to the wire.” Their impression was buttressed by a “barrage of
								calculated press leaks hinting at decision to send only a regiment
								on grounds U.S. concessions inadequate justify additional division.”
								(Telegram 803 from Seoul, January 31; ibid.)</note> Accordingly,
							President had ordered that detailed military planning and preparations
							be started with a view to meeting our April and July deadlines. As we
							knew, these had been under way jointly with COMUSK since beginning of
							week.</p>
                        <p>2. However President does not wish to announce the decision until after
							his return from Southeast Asia trip on February 17.<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">In a follow-up telegram, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> recommended that a message be sent to Pak,

                            <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> asked therefore that we strive
							together to give impression that negotiations are continuing.</p>
                        <p>3. Although President has agreed to despatch requested additional force,

                        <p>A. Per Diem Allowances. <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> says

							some members of <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> are arguing strongly
							for increase in allowances. <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> had
							resisted such arguments on grounds that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers in Vietnam are much better treated than <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> troops. However <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> insists that this is true only of officers and senior

								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would be very vulnerable if it

							Chang Ki-yong is very unhappy at U.S. unwillingness to announce
							additional commitment. FonMin had argued with <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> that U.S.D.L. commitment really open-ended, with actual
							amount of financing dependent upon <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							ability to come forward with suitable projects. Still it would be
							helpful if our willingness to make additional loans after $150 million
							is fully utilized could be stated more explicitly.</p>
                        <p>C. Program Loans. <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> is unhappy with $15
							million offer and with encouragement from Yi Hu-rak want to hold out for
							$30 million. He also wants commitment untied to stabilization program
							with no mention of further Washington review.</p>
                        <p>4. According to FonMin, <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> also
							complaining about our refusal even to discuss his requests for funds for
							education and remuneration for property utilized by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces. FonMin had persuaded President
							that these requests were undignified and irrelevant. <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> also professes not to understand our
							undertaking in regard to procurement for Vietnam and is afraid that they
							are excessively qualified by such references as “natural source,”
							“reasonably competitive price” and “selected types.”</p>
                        <p>5. I expressed deep appreciation on behalf of U.S. Govt and asked him to
							convey this at once to President Pak. I said I understood fully the
							reasons for deferring any announcement until after the President's
							return and said that I would entreat Washington to guard against any
							premature disclosure. I went on to say that we would consider points
							which he had raised and expressed further appreciation for his statement
							that these points were not to be regarded as conditions. On question of
							allowances I said that we had recently learned that in some cases <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers in Vietnam in lower enlisted
							grades might receive less than their Vietnamese counterparts, especially
							those with large families and in certain assignments. We were trying to
							get more information about this. I undertook to look again at language
							of our proposal on development loans. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: I had in mind possibility of a somewhat revised offer
							along lines of <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 792 and Dept's
							AIDTO unn reply thereto.<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">In telegram 792 from
								Seoul, January 27, the Embassy recommended authorizing a development
								loan of up to $10 million with which the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> could purchase heavy equipment to perform contract
								work in Vietnam or for U.S. forces in Korea. In AIDTO 1399 to Seoul,
								January 31, the Department of State indicated that the Embassy's
								alternative proposal was being considered in light of various
								contingencies and restrictions. (Both ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> On
							program loans I said I doubted very much if we could modify our
							proposal. In regard to procurement arrangements, I stressed difficulty
							of blanket a priori commitment and assured FonMin that we were doing
							everything to bring about favorable opportunities. This <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0195"/>was something that we would be working
							at continually with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials.</p>
                        <p>6. At this point FonMin assumed a conspiratorial air and said, “Now, Mr.
							Ambassador, we must stage a little play.” He assumed we had noticed that
							he was utilizing the press to create impression that negotiations with
							us were difficult and going slow.</p>
                        <p>Certain obstacles had been reported in the press which, as we knew, had
							actually been removed by our proposal. Such a stratagem was necessary
							and would have to go on for some days longer so that when President's
							decision was announced the Korean public would think that their govt had
							extracted great concessions from the U.S. by end of strenuous
							bargaining. To elaborate this impression, he was asking the Vice
							Minister to hold a series of meetings with the <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>. He himself would continue to report little progress to
							the press. Immediately upon the President's and his return from
							Southeast Asia he and I would meet again, the decision would be
							announced and immediately submitted for Assembly approval. I indicated
							that I would cooperate within the limits of propriety, but urged that he
							not carry the stage play so far that the Korean public would have an
							exaggerated expectation of the results and then be disappointed.</p>
                        <p>7. FonMin also asked for my cooperation after President's decision has
							been announced in making results of negotiations seem impressive to
							Korean public. He has in mind some kind of joint statement which would
							not embody whole contents of our letter of January 29, but merely those
							highlights, such as death benefits, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							transfer suspension, modification of “buy American” policy, which seem
							so important in Korean public opinion. The statement would also stress
							that Korea was acting in its own interest and in common defense rather
							than as result of financial bargaining with U.S. At that stage <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> did not want it to appear that its
							forces were being used as mercenaries. The favorable concessions which
							had in the previous act been extracted from the U.S. with such
							difficulty would at this stage be represented as spontaneous actions of
							U.S. expressing our appreciation for sacrifices being made by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                        <p>8. I believe we have attained our goal even if we are unyielding on the
							points on which FonMin sought our reconsideration. I do however feel
							that U.S. as well as <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would be
							vulnerable if <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers are paid less
							than <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> soldiers. We are asking USMACV
							for further facts. When these are received will submit our

							modifications in language <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0196"/>though not substance of our proposals on both development and program
							loans.</p>
                        <p>9. As we had begun to suspect (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
								804)<note n="5" xml:id="d77fn5">Telegram 804 from Seoul, January 31,
								contained summaries of press reports on the U.S. response to the

								before Korean troops could be sent to Vietnam. Initial positive
								reports were soon followed by reports of negative responses within
								the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. The Embassy believed the

							applying himself not only to actual negotiations but in his inimitable

							and, within limits set by our own standards, try to help him. If to our
							Western eyes there appears to be some inconsistency between the themes
							of act one and act two of his proposed play, we should not be too
							concerned. I gained the distinct impression that, while <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> may feel that he lost out somewhat,
							President and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> as a whole feel that
							our offer is fair and even somewhat better than some of them expected,

                        <p>A.I.D. Commitments to Korea in Connection with the Negotiations on
							Additional Korean Troops for Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s negotiations
							with the Korean Government for the dispatch of an additional Korean
							division and brigade have reached the point where he needs by tomorrow
							authority to present a packaged counter-proposal to the very excessive
							Korean demands, in the hope of completing the negotiations before the
							departure of President Park and other government officials on a Far
							Eastern tour February 7.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> has been acting
							under instructions which recognize the likely necessity of some forward
							commitments of A.I.D. <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0198"/>support
							including a modest increase in Supporting Assistance if necessary. In
							addition, his instructions permitted assurance of special procurement
							opportunities for Korean exporters to supply A.I.D. project programs in
							Vietnam. The Korean Government has asked for enormous increases in
							Supporting Assistance and Development Lending and a commitment to these
							higher levels for the next five years. The Ambassador has rejected these
							demands, but obviously needs to make some concessions if the
							negotiations are to be concluded successfully.</p>
                        <p>Acting upon our understanding of the President's desire for an early
							agreement to provide the additional troops and within the spirit of his
							pledge of U.S. long-term assistance to President Park last May, we have
							concurred (with a qualification noted below) in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s proposed counter-proposal to
							the Korean Government which provides that A.I.D. will:</p>
                        <p>1. Exclude all suppliers except U.S. and Korean from bidding on certain
							items which A.I.D. is buying for its project operations in Vietnam. This
							restricted procurement list will be composed of commodities which we
							have found to be within Korea's capacity to produce satisfactorily and
							in exportable quantities.</p>
                        <p>2. In addition to the $150 million Presidential development loan program
							promised last May, finance additional acceptable development projects of
							an unspecified amount and during an unspecified time period, subject to
							the same considerations of availability of funds, legislation, and
							A.I.D. self-help criteria which apply to the $150 million program. (This
							commitment is actually no more than a restatement of the Presidential
							Communiqué of last May with President Park of our anticipation of
							undertaking additional projects when the $150 million had been
							obligated.)</p>
                        <p>3. Release from local currencies presently available to A.I.D. of the
							modest net added cost to the Korean budget of the movement of the troops
							to Vietnam and of the maintenance of their replacements in Korea.</p>
                        <p>4. Support the Korean stabilization and development program, if the
							Korean Government is fulfilling its commitments under that jointly
							defined program, by providing a program loan of $15 million in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967. (At the same time we expect to
							reduce the grant Supporting Assistance by $10 million.) We had planned
							for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1967 a program loan of about the
							same size as, or possibly $5 million larger than, the recently approved
							$10 million loan. This new commitment, conditioned on stabilization
							performance, thus represents no significant departure from our plans,
							but it does limit our ability to withhold the loan next fiscal year on
							grounds other than failure to comply with the Stabilization
							Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0199"/>
                        <p>Only item 4, the program loan commitment, requires White House clearance
							under the present guidelines. Because of the urgency of Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s need for
							authorization, Bill Gaud discussed this matter with you last night and
							got your conditional agreement, subject to later reference to the
							President. Accordingly, we have qualified our concurrence on item 4 as
							being subject to further Washington review to be undertaken
							immediately.</p>
                        <p>Will you please seek the President's endorsement of this item so that we
							may withdraw the condition limiting the Ambassador's authority on this
							point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> concurs in this

								<gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>1) In absence opportunity consult with General <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>, I have no basis for comment on
							military necessity additional ten thousand <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops envisaged in reftel.</p>
                        <p>2) I am however, horrified at thought of now suddenly asking <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> for even more troops.</p>
                        <p>3) We asked for a small medical unit and got it (a few hundred). We asked
							for a much larger non-combat unit and got it (2000 men). We then asked
							for a combat division and got it (20,000 men). After an <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0200"/>embarrassingly short interval we asked
							for a further combat brigade and division, and we seem to have it (about
							30,000 men). Now, before we have even given the Koreans a chance to
							solidify their decision on the last brigade and division, we are
							contemplating asking them for ten thousand more.</p>
                        <p>4) When will this end?</p>
                        <p>5) If I were a Korean, such a request would seem to take Korea much too
							much for granted, and to try to impose far too great a burden on her.
							This would mean almost 60,000 Korean troops in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, two to three times as great a proportion of their
							population as we, the only other substantial contributor, are
							providing.</p>
                        <p>6) In the absence of a fuller and better rationale than I have yet seen
							for such a request, I would strongly recommend against it. Quite aside
							from the merits, such a piecemeal approach is most unfortunate.<note n="3" xml:id="d79fn3">The Embassy and <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> were also opposed to asking the Koreans for
								10,000 additional troops. The Embassy noted that a “new request will
								lead Koreans to assume that US has open-ended requirement for Korean
								troops in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will feel correspondingly
								justified in making open-ended demands on U.S. We seem to be taking
								their willingness to commit large numbers of young men for granted
								so long as we are willing to defray expenses.” The Embassy also
								pointed out that a new request could jeopardize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> commitment to send a division and a
								brigade promptly to Vietnam. (Telegram 869 from Seoul, February 14;
								ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7) It may well be that if “rounding out” is necessary, the Koreans will
							ask for it later themselves as General <persName>Choi</persName> did for
							the extra regiment he wants. This would be OK and much better than a
							request by us.</p>

							departure this will be announced publicly and a bill be introduced in
							the National Assembly authorizing the government to take this
							action.</p>
                        <p>2. Last night (February 22) I attended a dinner given by the Prime
							Minister in my honor along with Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, Ambassador Hand and Mr. Valenti. In addition to
							the Foreign Minister, Minister of National Defense and other government
							officials, the Prime Minister had invited prominent members of the
							government and opposition parties. After dinner the party leaders asked
							me a number of pointed questions of our purposes and prospects in
							Vietnam. I informed them about the Honolulu Conference and about our
							current strategy in Vietnam. I assured them of our determination to keep
							South Vietnam free and to fight to win against Communist aggression
							there. The Prime Minister assured me today that these discussions with
							the leaders of both parties in the National Assembly will be of great
							assistance to the government in winning both public and National
							Assembly approval for the deployment of additional forces.</p>
                        <p>3. The bill authorizing the additional forces is now being drafted in the
							Ministry of National Defense and after approval by the National Security
							Council will be submitted to the National Assembly within a few days.
							The Government leaders appear to have no doubt that the measure will be
							passed very quickly. Governor Harriman and I both urged on the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials the greatest possible speed
							in the deployment of additional forces in order to help General
							Westmoreland in his current campaigns against <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> centers of strength.</p>
                        <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0202"/>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders emphasized to me that
							their support for US actions in Vietnam was not only a matter of moral
							obligation but also of Korean self-interest in assuring the common
							defense against Communist aggression. Not unexpectedly Foreign Minister
								<persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi</persName> asked pointed questions
							about our conditions for a negotiated settlement in South Vietnam and
							voiced desire for <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> participation in
							any future summit conferences of the Honolulu type about Vietnam. He
							gave three reasons for his government's desire to be represented in
							future conferences: (a) the already heavy commitments of the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>;
							(b) the experience the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> could
							contribute in negotiating as well as fighting with the Communists; and
							(c) the promotion of the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s
							prestige internationally, which would be helpful not only to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, but to US as well. I responded on this
							point by saying that I thought this was constructive and helpful
							suggestion and that I would recommend to you that it be given most
							serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>5. I met with President Pak this morning. Prime Minister, Deputy Prime
							Minister, Ministers of National Defense and Foreign Affairs and Chief
							Presidential Secretary were present. [Here follows Pak's report of his
							discussions with officials in Thailand, Malaysia, and Taiwan.]</p>
                        <p>9. Pak said that the opposition statements in the US particularly from
							Members of Congress, were important reasons why there was a somewhat
							“dubious” attitude toward the US and a feeling that the US policy was
							“unclear”, not only in the three countries he visited, but also rather
							widely in Korea. The statements led “some of the people”, he said, to
							believe that in due course the US would pull out of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> without a firm result. He characterized
							as “irresponsible” statement about neutralization of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>, or putting <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> into a coalition government. Pak vigorously underlined a
							statement that “it would be the greatest mistake the US could make” if
							the US failed to achieve its objectives in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>10. I personally reassured Pak as well as his Ministers separately that
							negotiations would take place only with Hanoi and that the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could be conceivably represented only if
							Hanoi invited them to sit as members of their delegation; that we had no
							intention of telling the Vietnamese who to put into their cabinet; that
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s position was
							supported by an overwhelming majority both of the people and of the
							leadership. I told him we hoped we could avoid any direct conflict with
							the ChiComs because we think it would endanger the peace of the world
							and might lead to a world war, but if the Chinese moved against US with
							massive forces the Chinese would have to suffer the consequences. I made
							it very clear that the policies we pursue are designed not to bring
							China into the struggle, however.</p>
                        <p>11. I [garble—again?] reassured the President of our strong commitment to
							protect their national security in the event of an attack from <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0203"/>the North and thanked him for
							the leadership that he was exerting and in particular for their
							commitment in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. We agreed at the
							conclusion that there would be no announcement as I left about any troop
							despatch, that we would merely have a general statement covering the
							general subject of the conversation.</p>
                        <p>12. Pak looks more relaxed and confident than when I saw him two months
							ago. He obviously feels reassured about the strength of our commitment
							and is willing to back that feeling by the despatch of troops over
							rather considerable opposition in his own country.</p>
                        <p>13. I expressed appreciation for Pak's understanding and support of our
							policy and for his sending Korean troops to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, and promised him that we would keep him fully informed
							about our plans and actions. We considered Korea as an ally and equal
							and proposed to treat her as such.</p>

                        <p>On February 28, 1966, the Korean Government publicly announced its
							decision to provide one regiment and one division to Vietnam. The
							government submitted its request for approval to dispatch additional
							troops to the National Assembly on March 2. Although conceding
							uncertainty about winning support for the action from the opposition
							People's Party, the Embassy was “reasonably confident” that the majority
							Democratic Republican Party would pass the resolution. (Telegrams 947,
							954, 960, and 965 from Seoul, February 26, March 1, March 2, and March
							3, respectively, all in National Archives and Records Administration, RG
							59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET
								<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>As the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees of the National Assembly
							began considering the resolution, leaders of the People's Party
							announced their opposition to the request because of concerns that
							providing more troops would weaken Korea's defenses, concerns also
							expressed by members of the government party. In an effort to assuage
							those fears and buttress U.S. security commitments to Korea, support
							began to congeal around efforts generated by Assembly members of both
							parties to revise the United States-Korean Mutual Security Pact as a
							precondition to dispatching additional troops. The revision called for
							ending U.S. Constitutional requirements preventing an immediate <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0204"/>U.S. response to a conflict in
							Korea and for prohibiting any decrease in U.S. troop strength in Korea
							without first obtaining Korean approval. Both the Korean Government and
							the Embassy attempted to head off the movement by underscoring the
							totality of the U.S. commitment to Korean security. (Telegrams 965, 970,
							and 976 from Seoul, March 3, March 4, and March 7, respectively; all
							ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Earlier in the year the Department of State had authorized Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to inform the Koreans
							that the United States would not reduce its military presence without
							first consulting the Government of the Republic of Korea, if the latter
							dispatched additional troops to Vietnam. (Telegram 703 to Seoul, January
							8; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) But in response to the treaty question,
							the Department of State notified the Embassy that the United States
							could not revise the defense treaty with Korea, not only because of
							constitutionally mandated procedures, but also because the treaty
							contained the same formulations and standard wording used in all major
							defense treaties. The proposed revision of the treaty with Korea could
							call the provision contained in numerous other agreements into question.
							(Telegram 950 to Seoul, March 10; ibid.) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> provided the Foreign Minister
							with several letters addressing the security issue and reiterating the
							totality of U.S. policy toward the defense of Korea. (Airgram A–368 from
							Seoul, March 24; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>On March 11 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>
							submitted to President Pak a letter of appreciation from President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> for his decision to
							send additional troops to Vietnam. The letter was written in an attempt
							to advance and accelerate approval of the resolution. (Telegram 937 to
							Seoul, March 8, and telegram 990 from Seoul, March 9; ibid.) After
							receiving the letter, President Pak noted that approval of the
							resolution might be delayed because of opposition within the National
							Assembly, but indicated that the situation “would not delay despatch of
							troops since military preparations are proceeding according to
							schedule.” (Telegram 1000 from Seoul, March 11; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>After a late-night session of intense debate lasting until 3 a.m., the
							National Assembly voted on the resolution on March 20. The Assembly
							approved the resolution by a vote of 95 to 27 with 3 abstentions.
							(Telegram 1046 from Seoul, March 20; ibid.) On June 1 the Korean
							Minister of National Defense announced that the White Horse division
							would be sent to Vietnam in August and an additional 5,000-man unit
							would be furnished to support all Korean troops in Vietnam. He also
							noted that by October 1966 the Republic of Korea would have 45,000 men
							in Vietnam. (Telegram 1377 from Seoul, June 3; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–14 KOR/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Reftel A requests comments on proposal for “low key” approach to
							Korean military in Vietnam on the subject of approximately 10,000
							additional Korean logistical and supply forces.</p>
                        <p>2. I believe that any US effort to push the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> for additional forces would be most untimely and could
							have unfortunate consequences for us here. Even if such approach were in
							“low key” and were made in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, it
							would, of course, immediately become known to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government, which will just be emerging from highly
							difficult struggle to obtain Assembly approval for despatch additional
							brigade and division and which has through <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> in past few days given categoric assurances that no
							more than a total of 40,000 troops will be deployed to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. This struggle, the exacerbation of
							relationships with us which has unfortunately accompanied it, and the
							strains which it has generated within the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> as well as between government and opposition, will
							render atmosphere towards even hint of suggestion by US for further
							Korean contribution most unpropitious. US already being criticized for
							too much pressure.</p>
                        <p>3. We must remember that we have already pressed Koreans hard and to them
							unacceptably fast (Ref B). We must understand that Korea is not an
							inexhaustible source of supply for troops for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, that people's emotions are deeply involved, that there
							is substantial national anxiety about extent to which Korea has already
							gone. We must allow time for these emotions and this concern to settle.
							We must give Korean people time to catch their breath after two crucial
							and close decisions involving Korean lives and security. We should let
							them choose their own time and pace for requesting any
							reinforcements.</p>
                        <p>4. That General Chae, COMROKFV, at least, is thinking along the lines of
							Ref A indicated by the fact that he has proposed, with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> concurrence, a force
							structure for the deployment of the division and <gloss target="#t_RCT1">RCT</gloss> of approximately 30,000—about 8,000 above current plan.
							Most of these are logistic forces similar to those included in the <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0206"/>10,000 man proposal. <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> representatives now meeting
							in Korea express a strong desire for the additional logistic package
							proposed by General Chae, but recognize the attendant problems on the
							Korean scene and are working toward agreement on the 22,500 man force
							structure. Gen Rhee, <gloss target="#t_CG1">CG</gloss> Field Support
							Command, <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss>, is now negotiating
							package with <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss>. He has pressed for the 30,000 man force, but is
							understood to have scaled his requirement down to the 26,000–27,000
							level. Apparently <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> show no sympathy for any increase
							above 22,500. We should, for the time being at least, let the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s work this one out for themselves, and
							avoid any implication of US stimulus or pressure for this move.</p>
                        <p>5. In the event of a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> proposal for an
							increase over the 22,500 man dispatch, some additional quid pro quo
							would be required. As a minimum, <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> is
							expected to request replacement of military personnel with US funded
							civilians since the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military contend
							they are already faced with serious problem of insufficient manpower to
							support the planned expansion.</p>
                        <p>6. I therefore consider that any further US approach on this subject at
							this time would be adverse to US interest, and recommend against.
							However, if the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> with President Pak's
							approval should later make such a proposal, the US could then safely
							support it.</p>
                        <p>7. I cannot too strongly emphasize how unfortunate it would be for our
							interests in this country if even a hint that we were considering the
							possibility of further Korean troops should ever get into the press in
							Washington, Saigon, or Seoul.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>

							Seoul's 1102,<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">In telegram 1102 from Seoul,
								April 1, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> detailed
								Korean concerns about the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
								agreement. (Ibid.) An April 8 Intelligence Memorandum issued by the
									<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, entitled “Pending US-South
								Korean Status-of-Forces Agreement,” also discussed the situation in
								Korea and the problems hindering Korean acceptance of the agreement.
								(Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, Korea, Vol.
								III, November 1965 to December 1966)</note> that we modify the
							criminal jurisdiction provision in the Korean Status of Forces
							Agreement. As you will recall, the present jurisdiction formula was very
							carefully worked out over a period of long negotiation as the most
							practical solution for meeting Korean political sensitivities on the one
							hand and for assuring the protection of our service personnel on the
							other. Although not the optimum solution from the Defense viewpoint,
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> accepted,
							over service and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> objections,
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s recommendation
							that the German formula provides the best vehicle for accommodating
							Korean and United States needs on this difficult issue.</p>
                        <p>We also cannot accept Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s understanding that there is no legal difference
							between the German formula, as now embodied in the Korean agreement, and
							the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Netherlands arrangement he
							proposes to substitute. The Korean proposal (in effect, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Netherlands formula) was rejected
							because of the substantial differences between the German and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Netherlands arrangements. Our Embassy
							was carefully instructed to emphasize these differences, i.e., the
							substantive and procedural requirements before a waiver recall may be
							effected under the German formula, in order to impress upon the Koreans
							that we expect great restraint in the recall of waivers. Nor can we
							agree that the German formula is discriminatory toward Korea. As its
							name implies, the German formula governs the exercise of jurisdiction
							over the large number of U.S. forces in the Federal Republic and should
							not be an unacceptable precedent in Seoul.</p>
                        <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0208"/>
                        <p>We also have indications that the Koreans would like to reopen other
							articles (e.g. the claims and labor articles).<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">In telegram 1172 from Seoul, April 18, the Embassy
								reported that the Korean Foreign Minister told <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> he wanted to reopen
								negotiations on all three disputed articles—criminal jurisdiction,
								claims, and labor. The request came in response to information
								received about the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> agreement
								reached between the United States and the Philippines, which, in the
								Foreign Minister's view, had been given “preferred treatment on
								criminal jurisdiction” based on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Netherlands formula. (National Archives and
								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, DEF 15–3 KOR
								S–US)</note> Any relaxation of our position that the negotiation is
							complete is certain to bring in its wake other Korean requests for the

                        <p>In our view, the foregoing considerations outweigh the grounds on which

                        <p>1214. For the Secretary and Assistant Secretary
								<persName>Bundy</persName> from Ambassador. <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>. Ref: A. Deptel 1118.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">The
								Joint State-Defense message transmitted in telegram 1118 to Seoul,
								April 22, informed the Embassy that the criminal-jurisdiction
								article in the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> with Korea
								could not be modified and set forth the reasons on which that
								decision was based. (Ibid.)</note> B. Embtels 1200 and 1201.<note n="3" xml:id="d84fn3">In telegrams 1200 and 1201, both April 23, the
								Embassy argued for reopening the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> negotiations to assuage Korean concerns that the
								current agreement was substandard to <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>s negotiated with other Asian countries, notably
								Japan and the Philippines. (Both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I am sending you this message, in order to be sure before carrying out
							instructions contained in para two reftel A,<note n="4" xml:id="d84fn4">Paragraph 2 of telegram 1118 instructed the Embassy to “inform
								FonOff we regard negotiation completed and agreement reached fair,
								balanced, and workable.” Washington's decision derived from the
								perception that the current <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
								balanced Korean and U.S. needs and interests and that, although it
								was a good agreement, there would always be some political
								opposition to <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> in Korea with or
								without further revisions. (Ibid.)</note> that the highest levels in
							Washington concerned not just with <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
							but also with the U.S. position in Vietnam are fully aware of what in my
							judgment will be the adverse consequences of the position stated in
							reftel A. I also would like to be sure that ref Embtels, which crossed
							ref Deptel in transmission, have been considered.</p>
                        <p>2. Under normal circumstances I would fully concur with the position
							taken in ref Deptel that the host government should now agree to proceed
							with an agreement reached after such difficulty. We do not, however,
							face normal circumstances. The situation here has altered considerably
							since the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> was negotiated and to
							the Korean mind this is complete justification for a different attitude
							towards it. Whatever high officials may have said in the past, <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> as it now stands is not politically
							acceptable here and the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> at least
							will not see it to their advantage to sign the <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> and try to get it through the Assembly well before the
							elections. They have already served notice, both in the press and
							privately to us, that they do not intend to do so. The argument that
							similar agreements have been concluded with Germany and China and other
							arguments in para 2 of ref Deptel will, I am afraid, not be persuasive
							here, valid as they may appear to us.</p>
                        <p>3. The mood in Korea today is one of uncertainty and some apprehension
							insofar as the war in Vietnam is concerned. The recent disturbances and
							shaky position of the government of <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>,
							fears as to the <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0210"/>consequences of
								<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> elections, doubts as to what the
							U.S. would be prepared to settle for in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, fanned by incomplete and sometimes distorted press
							reports about statements by high U.S. Government officials, all are the
							subject of anxious discussion which in the end come back to Korea's
							relationship to the U.S. People are beginning to question whether a
							further division should be sent this summer in view of the changed
							situation in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and fears as to changes
							in U.S. policy. There seems to be a growing uneasy feeling that the U.S.
							has somehow got Korea into a dangerous situation and doubt as to whether
							we are going to stand by to help.</p>
                        <p>4. Moreover, election time is approaching in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and most economic and political decisions, including
							foreign policy decisions, from here on in will be determined by
							political, i.e., campaign considerations. U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> disagreement over <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss>
							would very probably supply the “gut” national issue which is thus far
							lacking. Sovereignty and national prestige is the most sensitive issue
							in Asia. U.S. reluctance to re-open negotiations and our refusal to
							accept modifications in criminal jurisdiction provision will be seized
							upon eagerly by press and opposition and built up as evidence that
							present <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> cannot satisfactorily
							manage <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations with U.S. which
							goes its own way regardless of sacrifices made by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to help U.S. in Vietnam. Opposition
							parties would be supplied with a rallying cry which could easily unite
							them and with which they could, if they desire, call students into the
							streets to demonstrate. One can imagine also the glee with which
							Communist propaganda will seize upon and elaborate this theme in its
							propaganda to this country. All of this is beyond <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s ability to control and, as we have
							pointed out, there is real danger that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will feel it must take an initiative.</p>
                        <p>5. An atmosphere of frustration and exasperation with the U.S. is not an
							atmosphere conducive to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public
							support for the despatch of further troops to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. I am not prepared to say that the government will not
							fulfill its commitment, as President Pak is deeply engaged, but an
							uproar about U.S.-Korean relations arising out of <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> would create very real problems for
							him, particularly if troubles in Vietnam are not satisfactorily resolved
							and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> casualty rates begin to
							mount.</p>
                        <p>6. As indicated in ref Embtels, we continue to believe that the interests
							of our servicemen would be fully protected if we are forthcoming with
							respect to criminal jurisdiction and that other <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> demands can be contained to our satisfaction.<note n="5" xml:id="d84fn5">Documents submitted by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> requesting renewed <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> negotiations and containing
								proposed changes in the criminal-jurisdiction, labor, and claims

                        <p>After the National Assembly voted on March 20, 1966, to approve the
							resolution enabling Korea to dispatch additional troops to Vietnam,
							Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yi Tong-won</persName> once
							again turned his attention to planning the Foreign Ministers Conference
							in Seoul. On March 22 the Japanese announced their decision to attend
							the conference. As a result of the timely intervention of Thai Foreign
							Minister Thanat Khoman, several Asian countries were persuaded to attend
							the conference, and a preparatory meeting to determine the agenda was
							held in Bangkok in April. (Memorandum from D.W. Ropa to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, June 7; Johnson Library,
							National Security File, Country File, Korea, Vol. III, November 1965 to
							December 1966; and telegram 1065 from Seoul, March 23; National Archives
							and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 KOR S)</p>
                        <p>The Ministerial Meeting for Asian and Pacific Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>) was subsequently held in Seoul
							June 14–16, 1966. In telegram 1465 from Seoul, June 16, the Embassy
							forwarded the text of the joint communiqué issued at the close of the
							meeting. (Ibid.) Afterward the Korean Foreign Minister characterized the
							meeting as the “beginning of new era in Asia-Pacific area leading to
							growing sense of regionalism and greater [garble—chance?] of solidarity
							among participating nations. Results of conference far exceeded anything
							he expected and consequently he very proud about role Korea played.”
							(Telegram 1472 from Seoul, June 18; ibid.) The Department of State also
							viewed the meeting as an “impressive achievement of Asian statesmanship”
							and welcomed “the constructive and forward-looking initiatives taken by
							the conference.” (Telegram 1365 to Seoul, June 17; ibid.)</p>

							South Koreans against increasing North Korean subversive efforts. These
							efforts involved the recruitment of agents in South Korea and the
							sending across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> of infiltrating
							groups. He had recommended to the South Korean police a stepped-up
							effort to arrest agents and collaborators and to round up infiltrating
							groups. This would require some improved police equipment, largely in
							the communications and armaments field. Police at the present time were
							unable to communicate from region to region with sufficient rapidity.
							They were also considerably out-gunned by the infiltrating North
							Koreans. The South Koreans, through tapping President Park's contingency
							fund, had come up with $50,000 for the purchase of equipment. They
							probably could raise a somewhat larger sum [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2

							could put the idea through regular channels. (Subsequent conversations

							security jobs, backing up both US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said forces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> will
							soon total 300,000 and that the US will continue to increase its forces
							in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. These troops will be removed
							when no longer necessary, but the US would not at that time permit a
							vacuum to be created. The Chinese Communists would fill in any vacuum.
							He said that US installations and construction in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> might give the Vietnamese a feeling
							that the US plans to stay. This appearance worried him. The Secretary
							said that the Korean proposal to <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0215"/>provide Korean reserves to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> would
							be helpful to increase the number of Asian faces in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and would help to offset the large
							American presence there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that both the Vietnamese and the Viet Cong were
							suffering terrible casualties. He said the Vietnamese political
							institutions were weak. With these factors in mind, he asked for
							Minister Kim's thoughts on the possible length of the war. Kim said that
							this was a difficult question. First, the power in-country must be put
							in one man's hands, who would, unfortunately, be called a dictator. This
							could not be helped during these difficult times. Second, the military
							must be unified behind this leader and the many internal frictions
							overcome. He said the period of the war is difficult to predict until
							these steps are taken. He believed at this time, there are too many
							factors—leadership, political stability, military stability—to give any
							predictions.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of bombing North Vietnam.]</p>

                            <hi rend="italic"> US–<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> Public
								Relations</hi>. In response to the Secretary's request for other
							thoughts of Kim on Vietnam, the Minister said that he thought that there
							is a need for the US soldiers in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> to
							have a greater capability to respond quickly with food and other
							comforts for refugees and survivors of areas or villages taken under
							attack. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers always take
							some of the extra rice furnished by the Vietnamese Government and
							provide this rice to refugees and survivors. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers are also told to dig wells and take on chores
							in the damaged areas quickly to avoid hardships on the people. The
							Americans have lots of equipment and materials but they do not respond
							quickly to the people's needs. The Minister said he was not criticizing
							but only passing on what his <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss>
							commanders told him. The Secretary said this was a good point and he
							would look into it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Korean Economy and Defense</hi>. The Secretary said he
							was very pleased with the continuing improvement in the Korean economy.
							Minister Kim said that there was some improvement but that the Korean
							economy is based on agriculture. The weather plays a major role in the
							Korean economy since it directly affects agriculture. Last year Korea
							was fortunate in having good weather. This is the first year's harvest
							(spring 1966) in which no rice crisis occurred. Ambassador Kim said the
							Korea economy is moving upward but will “plateau” in the next few years.
							This plateau period would be followed by some gradual improvement, the
							extent of incline being dependent on a number of factors. Ambassador Kim
							expressed concern that the US, seeing an improving Korean economy, would
							decrease its grant aid. He said Korea's grant aid has dropped from $300
							million to $60 million. The Secretary said that it is necessary to
							consider the over-all number of grant-aid commitments <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0216"/>of US and to realize that other needy
							countries must be helped. Their situation is much less favorable than
							that of Korea. The Secretary said that we must look at the Korean
							economy and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense budget. He
							is concerned about the soldier to population ratio; continuing in the
							present manner is not good for Korea in the long run. He was not
							suggesting a change now in view of the <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> situation and the present Korea economy. He thought
							that Korea and the US must begin to think about the size of Korean
							forces relative to North Korean forces, and US forces. Our forces must
							be considered with the size of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Army. The effects of a large army on the Korean economy must be studied.
							The Secretary said he thought, personally, Korea's economy was being
							hampered by the size of its armed forces. Minister Kim said the
							geographical position of Korea made the people worry about their
							security. He said the capabilities of China and North Korea cannot be
							overlooked. If the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military is
							reduced, the people will be reluctant to invest their savings in the
							country. The US presence in Korea also gives the people confidence in
							Korea's future. If these conditions are removed, the people will be
							reluctant to do anything about Korea's development. The Secretary said
							that he understood this situation. He likened it to West Berlin where
							the people would be reluctant to invest without the presence of strong
							military forces. The Secretary said he still believed it necessary to
							explore, together, the correct size of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces and at the same time the methods which
							might be used to convince the Korean people that reduction in force
							levels can be undertaken without endangering the country. He proposed
							that he and <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> Kim continue to look at
							the problems of force size and Korean economic development together, and
							to hold further discussions on it in the future.</p>
                        <p>Kim's Views on Various Policies. The Secretary suggested that he and
							Minister Kim discuss, after the black-tie dinner (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s home, 22 June), the
							following: US policy on Red China (admittance to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, US relations with, etc.), the Role of Japan in the
							Future, India, the Conference in Seoul-<gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> and its possibilities, and the general security of

							when Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
							visited Seoul July 8 and 9, 1966. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> attended the SEATO meeting in Canberra, traveled to
							Manila and Taipei, and attended the meeting of the United States-Japan
							Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs in Kyoto prior to visiting
							Seoul. In Seoul the Secretary met with the Foreign Minister, Prime

                        <p>In the weeks leading up to the visit Ambassador Kim urged officials at
							the Department of State to work toward achieving final agreement and
							signature on the Status of Forces Agreement. (Memorandum of
							Conversation, June 21; ibid., Central Files 1964–66, DEF 15–3 KOR S–US)
							After the United States studied Korea's proposed changes to the
							agreement submitted in early June 1966, the Departments of State and
							Defense ultimately agreed to modify the criminal-jurisdiction, claims,
							and labor articles of the current agreement, thus addressing some of
							Korea's primary concerns. (Airgram A–467 from Seoul, June 10; ibid; and

                        <p>The most important change to the criminal-jurisdiction article, the final

							final wording clarified to Korea's satisfaction the application of
							military law to United States forces stationed on its territory. (Letter
							from <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>, July 13; ibid.) Although
							primary jurisdiction remained with Korea and required the United States
							to request a waiver in any individual case, Korea was required to notify
							the United States of its desire to exercise that jurisdiction in cases
							of importance. (Korean <gloss target="#t_SOFA1">SOFA</gloss> Problem,

                        <p>Dave Bell asks authority to go ahead with a $12 million <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> loan to the Korean Reconstruction Bank
							(KRB) (see Tab A for Bell's proposal).<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">Neither tab is printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>This loan partially fulfills your $150 million commitment to President
							Park made in May 1965.</p>
                        <p>The loan will enable the KRB to expand its financing of medium-size

							promotion program.</p>
                        <p>We share the financing load of the KRB with the Korean Government and the

							of the proposed loan, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is requiring
							the KRB to make some internal organizational changes, to improve its
							financial analysis branch, and to use better accounting procedures.</p>
                        <p>Our loan would be used solely to finance U.S. capital goods and services.

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>Last November 2,<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">This letter contained a
								lengthy commentary on political, social, and attitudinal
								developments within Korea. (Ibid., Ambassador's Private
								Correspondence, 1964–1966)</note> I wrote you of my impression that
							a new climate of beliefs and attitudes was beginning to emerge in Korea
							and I reflected upon its implications for the future. The transformation
							of the Korean national attitude from one of doubt and dependency to one
							of increasing self-confidence and hope, which was reported in that
							letter, has since deepened and become even more of an influence on
							national and individual action.</p>
                        <p>In that letter I wrote principally in terms of individual and internal
							attitudes—what individual Koreans and the Korean Government were doing
							and hoped to be able to do about the development of their own country
							and their own personal fortunes. Today I want to place more stress upon
							Korea's new conception of its relationship with the outside world, a
							theme which has become increasingly important in the counterpoint <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0220"/>of motivation and concern in
							Korean thinking. For Korea is no longer, and probably never again will
							be, the hermit kingdom which it had been for so many years.</p>
                        <p>Korea has traditionally been a country which looked backward rather than
							forward, looked inward rather than outward, evaded or deflected
							relationships with other countries rather than initiated or influenced
							them.</p>
                        <p>People have thus tended to think of Korea, indeed Koreans tended to think
							of themselves, as an introverted people, suspicious of outside
							influences, fighting to maintain their national individuality and
							ancient heritage in the face of enormous pressures from countries far
							more powerful than Korea.</p>
                        <p>Today we see a Korea actively claiming a position in the outside world;
							energetically seeking to assert its influence; sincerely expecting, as a
							matter of right, that greater powers should consult it and respect its
							opinions.</p>
                        <p>Today we see in Seoul a procession of distinguished state visitors from
							all over the world; the Tunku from Malaysia, the Prime Minister of South
							Vietnam, the Foreign Minister of Japan, the heir apparent in Taiwan, the
							Foreign Minister of the Malagasy Republic, the Foreign Minister of
							Argentina, the Vice President of the United States, the United States
							Secretary of State, the leader of the German Bundesrat, the Foreign
							Secretary of Great Britain, the Foreign Minister of Australia. The
							Presidents of Germany and of the Philippines are expected soon and the
							Indonesian Foreign Minister has said he would like to come. There is an
							almost automatic assumption that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would visit Korea should he decide to travel to
							the Far East.</p>
                        <p>We find the Koreans, who for years have been laboring under a
							self-imposed version of their own Hallstein doctrine in their diplomatic
							relations with other countries, showing signs of flexibility. Shortly
							after the overthrow of the Communist Party in Indonesia in the fall of
							1965, they began actively to consider and then to approve the
							establishment of a Consulate General at Djakarta, while a North Korean
							Embassy is still there. Nevertheless they saw that it could be
							practically useful to them to establish relationships right away with
							the new, more pro-Western Indonesian regime. This same flexibility is
							influencing their thinking and attitudes toward Ghana and other
							professed neutralist nations.</p>
                        <p>We see the Korean Foreign Minister planning visits to several Latin
							American countries and we observe intense Korean diplomatic activities
							in every corner of Africa seeking representation.</p>
                        <p>We have the Foreign Minister of Korea stating that he is anxious to hold
							a conference of the nations providing troops for South Vietnam, not
							because of any substantive business that needs to be transacted in <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0221"/>this manner, but as a means of
							demonstrating to the world that the United States is not alone in its
							struggle in Vietnam and has important Asian support.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most dramatic, we see the Koreans initiating and acting as host
							to a conference of the Foreign Ministers of ten Asian nations, not
							seeking a military alliance, not seeking aid, not seeking support for
							any purely Korean policy or interest, but providing a forum in which
							Asian nations can meet together as Asians, get to know each other and
							begin in a quiet way some concerted attack on Asian problems of mutual
							interest. This conference did not include just the natural allies of
							Korea and those whose thoughts run along the same lines, such as China
							or South Vietnam, but included Japan and Malaysia and, had the
							Indonesians wished it, Indonesia.</p>
                        <p>When <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> opened, President Pak made a
							keynote speech which was wise and impressive.<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">In an August 17 letter to <persName>Bundy</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> traced Pak's transformation
								from an aloof and insecure military dictator into an effective and
								respected national leader and statesman. (Ibid., East Asia
								General)</note> The Foreign Minister presided with dignity in the
							open meetings and acted with skill and consideration during the
							negotiating sessions. The substance of the communiqué and the degree of
							the agreement was a surprise to all the outside world and to many of the
							participants.</p>
                        <p>It is true that the conference probably never would have happened if it
							had not won the enthusiastic and skillful support of Thanat Khoman, and
							that the participation of Japan was in large part simply a desire to be
							nice to the Koreans and to help out in the process of normalization so
							recently and painfully achieved. But the Japanese, for whatever reason,
							did come and Khoman did help, and the Conference did take place.</p>
                        <p>The effect of <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss> on Korea, of
							course, has been important. For the first time in its entire history,
							Korea finds itself in a position of having initiated an international
							activity, participated in by most of the free world countries of Asia,
							including the greatest, a traditional enemy, which was by all tests a
							substantial success. </p>
                        <p>The worlds of trade, commerce and finance also now offer new horizons to
							the Korean mood and imagination. A Korean construction company is
							building a highway in Thailand on a job won in international
							competition. Korean companies are dredging harbors and moving cargo
							along the Vietnamese coast. Koreans are pushing their exports not only
							in Japan and in the United States, but in Southeast Asia and Scandinavia
							and Africa and Europe with surprising success. Korea is seeking to
							accede to <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>. An Asian Development
							Bank is proposed <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0222"/>and Korea is
							active in the process of its establishment, ready to contribute more
							than its proportionate share of the required assets and anxious to have
							a position in its executive direction. Korea has repaid a debt of $10
							million to the National City Bank of New York. The Government of Korea
							is promulgating a five year economic development plan which officially
							contemplates the decline and ultimate abolition of supporting assistance
							and PL 480 food grants during the period of its life and seeks to find
							foreign capital prepared to invest in Korea's economic future.</p>
                        <p>Thus, to a new self-confidence has been added a new outlook and a new
							attitude toward the outside world in which Korea now conceives of
							herself as playing an important part.</p>
                        <p>This outlook is different in quality and motivation towards Asia, the
							United States, and the rest of the world. This is natural and derives
							from Korean self-interest. Korea's attitude towards Europe, Latin
							America, and Africa are naturally dominated by great distances,
							differences in culture and unrelated histories. Its interests are
							limited and are viewed primarily in terms of two questions: the Korean
							question in the United Nations and trade. Active diplomacy to win the
							support of as many as possible of the newly emerging African nations for
							the Korean position in the United Nations is only common sense.
							Developing trade ties with Europe and with Africa and Latin America is
							similarly sensible.</p>
                        <p>But with respect to Asia, Korea appears to be interested not only in its
							immediate self-interest, but also in playing a part in policy
							developments in the area. In the short space of two years Korea has come
							to believe that it has both the ability and the right to have a voice in
							Asian policy—political, military and economic. It is willing to pay its
							way as is shown by its troops in Vietnam, by its contribution to the
							Asian Development Bank, and by its active participation in the planning
							for future practical activities of <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Koreans conceive of the free Asian countries as having a
							responsibility for dealing with Asian problems. They feel that it would
							be desirable for them to do so without the interference or sometimes
							even the participation of the United States. They recognize, of course,
							that the United States has a vital and tremendous interest in Asia. They
							recognize that Asian power vis-a-vis the communists is negligible,
							certainly at present, unless supported by United States power.
							Nevertheless, they feel that it is desirable for all concerned that
							Asians should take initiative and carry responsibility with respect to
							their problems. They see no incompatibility between this independence of
							thought and action and the United States interest.</p>
                        <p>This emergence of Korea from its eremitic attitude of mind adds still
							another dimension to our relationship, which will involve problems as
							well as opportunities. These we will attempt to analyze in more <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0223"/>detail as the shape of things
							to come emerges more clearly. But certain things can now be said in
							general.</p>
                        <p>The success of Korea's ventures into external relationships has of course
							added greatly to the self-confidence reported in my earlier letter and
							to the Korean sense of independence.</p>
                        <p>We have a very special relationship with the Koreans. The Republic would
							not exist had it not been for us. We make possible its military
							establishment. We participate in all major economic decisions of its
							Government. In the central sanctum of the Economic Planning Board there
							are always Americans. Each provincial Governor has an American advisor.
							We have unusual intelligence liaison arrangements. The American military
							review and pass on virtually every aspect of the Korean defense
							budget.</p>
                        <p>Everywhere one goes in Korea there are Americans in key places. These men
							are frequently “advising” men senior to them and as competent as they
							are. Sometimes their major function is to provide a counterweight to
							undesirable Korean political pressures. Thus far, to the credit of all
							concerned, the relationships have been easy and mutually rewarding. We
							are still needed, and badly needed, in many places and on many
							problems.</p>
                        <p>But it cannot be expected that this very intimate and special
							relationship, so pervasive and so all embracing, can continue, or indeed
							should continue, as the process of economic growth, political maturity,
							and international competence proceeds, particularly if it does so at the
							rapid pace which has characterized the last two years. The problem can
							perhaps be stated by saying that we have an abnormally close and
							abnormally good relationship with the Koreans. How can we best move to a
							close and good relationship with the Koreans that approximates more
							nearly the type that normally exists between two friendly sovereign
							nations?</p>
                        <p>Here in Seoul we have for some time been attempting gradually to
							establish the psychological and physical basis for this adjustment.</p>
                        <p>It can, I believe, fairly be said that an appreciable element in the
							recent growth of Korean self-confidence has been United States stress on
							the need for increasing Korean initiative and responsibility. For
							example, we have tried to arrange things so that we comment on their
							proposals rather than vice versa. This was at first purely political
							window dressing. It has now become substantive fact. We have encouraged
							wider Korean contacts with other countries and international
							institutions. We have helped them develop and establish the
							institutional arrangements which will enable them better to stand on
							their own feet. We have placed increasing responsibility on Korean
							military leaders.</p>
                        <p>But the umbilical cord has not yet been cut, and its actual and visible
							severance will be a slow process and a delicate one. It will have to be
							done in such a way as to avoid the impression that we are reducing our
							interest <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0224"/>or any assistance that
							is legitimately needed. It is a process which may be resisted at times
							by the Koreans themselves. It will be wise for us not to view this
							process as against our interest, nor to conceive of it as constituting
							the loss of an influence which we could hope to retain.</p>
                        <p>I do not think that the time has yet quite come for anything much to be
							done overtly about this. But the time will come, probably sooner than
							later, and we, as well as the Koreans, must be mentally and
							psychologically prepared so that we can be in control of the adjustment
							of relationships as it develops.</p>

                        <p>1. In its July 21 memorandum on the Korean unification problem,<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">Excerpts from the July 21 memorandum are in
								American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1966, pp.
								705–707.</note> the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>) suggested convening of a Geneva-type
							conference for the “peaceful settlement of the Korean Question.” In its
							proposal, put forth in the context of the long time <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> unification position, the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> suggested that such a conference
							could discuss means of attaining a lasting peace in Korea and realizing
							its peaceful unification. The North Koreans proposed that the conference
							be attended by representatives of North and South Korea as well as equal
							numbers of interested governments nominated by each side. They did not
							explain what the conference would do and continued to insist that
							outside powers including the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had no
							right “to interfere in the internal affairs of Korea.”</p>
                        <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0225"/>
                        <p>2. Since the issuance of the July 21 memorandum the call for an
							international conference has been a continuing theme in the North Korean
							propaganda and various diplomatic approaches on the unification question
							but without any softening of the North Korean terms for unification
							(withdrawal of foreign troops, unsupervised national elections et al.).
							The latest major public statement was Vice Premier Kim Kwang-hyop's
							September 8 speech in which he mentioned the conference proposal in a
							low key—while reiterating the standard North Korean unification
							line.</p>
                        <p>3. The USSR has publicized the North Korean conference proposal. It
							requested the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General to
							circulate the July 21 memorandum and in a September 12 broadcast chided
							the U.S. for having “categorically repudiated” the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> conference proposal. In conjunction
							with the other bloc members, the Soviet Union has also proposed a
							separate <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> agenda item on “the
							withdrawal of all American and other foreign troops occupying South
							Korea under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Flag and the
							dissolution of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>.” (The USSR had
							previously proposed a similar item in 1962.)</p>
                        <p>4. To date there has been no measurable international reaction to the
							North Korean conference proposal at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or elsewhere. The Republic of Korea has publicly
							dismissed the North Korean call for a conference as a propaganda
							gesture. The Department spokesman in response to a question commented
							only that our position in support of the competence and authority of the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to deal with the Korean question
							was well known. He did not comment directly on the North Korean
							conference proposal.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Present Situation </p>
                        <p>5. We have no evidence at present that the North Korean proposal has
							caused weakening of international support for our traditional position
							on the Korean question (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-supervised
							elections throughout the peninsula and seating of the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> alone in the General Assembly's
							Political Committee for the debate on the Korean question).<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">U.S. policy objectives with regard to the Korea item
								at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> were “to preserve <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s favored international position
								vis-á-vis North Korea, to maintain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
								presence in Korea, and to retain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
								role in Korean unification on terms acceptable to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and US, with maximum support
								among <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> members.” (Telegram 1873 to

								1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4 KOR/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>)</note> However, it is clear that the
							North Koreans, with the support of the USSR, have embarked on a major
							propaganda campaign which has as its objectives a.) demonstrating that
							the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> fear any serious
							moves toward unification of Korea; b.) highlighting the fact that large
							numbers of American troops are still in Korea thirteen years after the
							year of <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0226"/>the Korean conflict;
							and c.) capturing the tactical initiative on this question, weakening
								<gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> support for the US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position.<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">While not clearly related to the North Korean proposal, abstention
								of nine Afro-Asian countries on inscription on the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> agenda of our Korean item is another
								portent of increased difficulties at this year's session. [Footnote
								in the source text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>There has been no indication, however, that the North Korean conference
							proposal is, in fact, a serious substantive initiative to achieve
							unification nor has there yet been any overt move to contrast our
							position on the Korean question with our Viet-Nam policy statements
							regarding negotiations or troop withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>6. Privately the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has interpreted
							the North Korean proposal as a tactic to insinuate a new element into
							the continuing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> domestic debate on
							unification, as well as a gambit to weaken <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> support for the traditional approach to the
							unification problem. Since there is as yet no demonstrable evidence of
							loss of international support, the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							has not conceded the necessity of changing our traditional tactics. It
							has emphasized that particularly because of the 1967 elections the
							Korean unification question must be handled as in the past, emphasizing
							the competence and authority of the United Nations on the unification
							question and the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s favored
							international position. The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> also
							believes that a positive response on its part could weaken its
							international position (the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is
							recognized by seventy-five countries, North Korea by twenty-five) by
							tending to equate the two regimes.</p>
                        <p>7. While the North Korean proposal has not so far generated any visible
							reaction, we believe that the conference proposal might elicit
							sympathetic reactions from some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							members, particularly neutralist countries, seriously complicating our
							approach to the Korean question at the 21st <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and, more generally, could put the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and ourselves on the defensive publicly
							and internationally. Flat rejection of the North Korean proposal could
							also appear inconsistent with the continued U.S. endorsement of a
							conference on Viet-Nam, despite dissimilarities in the present
							situations in Korea and Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>8. Based on the existing wide international support for the Republic of
							Korea, we and the South Koreans are now in a position to take the
							tactical play away from the North Koreans on this issue, without
							jeopardizing our substantive position. In considering future responses
							to the North Korean-bloc conference proposal, particularly in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, we believe that both we and the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> could adopt a public position
							which would:</p>
                        <p>a. make clear that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the U.S.
							are ready and willing to sit down with the North Koreans to discuss
							implementing relevant <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0227"/>resolutions on unification
							whenever the North Koreans announce their readiness to accept <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> competence and authority;</p>
                        <p>b. emphasize that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces (including
							American troops) in Korea under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							resolutions are there to preserve peace and security in the area and
							that we are prepared to withdraw our forces when the conditions for a
							lasting settlement have been fulfilled;</p>
                        <p>c. point out that our position in support of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formula for unification in fact assures that the Korean
							people will have the right to self-determination;</p>
                        <p>d. expose the North Korean unification proposals for what they are:
							propaganda devices which would deny to their own people the right to
							self-determination, in contrast to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							formula which calls for a democratic election process verified by the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>;</p>
                        <p>e. point out that the North Koreans, in their propaganda and in their
							clandestine efforts to infiltrate the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, have as their sole objective the overthrow of the
							democratically-elected government and the social structure of the south.
							Infiltration of North Korean agents and <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> incidents continue and the North Korean propaganda
							continues to attack the Park Government in the most vitriolic terms
							attempting to incite its overthrow.</p>
                        <p>9. The public position outlined above would:</p>
                        <p>a. show that we are not afraid of negotiations but will not compromise on
							the principles set forth by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (free
							national elections under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							supervision);</p>
                        <p>b. demonstrate <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> confidence in its
							ability to defend its own interests;</p>
                        <p>c. highlight North Korea's continuing refusal to accept the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (or any outside) role in unification;</p>
                        <p>d. preserve the US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> substantive
							position on the unification question, but in a more publicly defensible
							context.</p>
                        <p>10. In response to the Soviet resolution regarding the withdrawal of
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces from Korea and the
							dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and
							Rehabilitation of Korea (<gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>), we
							should make the following points:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Korea are there as a
							result of communist aggression in 1950.</p>
                        <p>b. These forces are there under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							Security Council resolutions reaffirmed annually since that time.</p>
                        <p>c. The presence of these <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces,
							including the American troops, is the major element in stabilizing a
							potentially dangerous point of confrontation between the communist bloc
							and the free world. The proof of this is in the record since the
							Armistice in 1953. There has been <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0228"/>no aggressive action on the part of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces and their presence has effectively
							deterred any resumption of hostilities in the area.</p>
                        <p>d. Under the shield provided by these forces, both the Republic of Korea
							and Japan have made significant economic and political progress.</p>
                        <p>We are, of course, prepared to withdraw our remaining forces from Korea
							when the conditions for a lasting settlement have been fulfilled. Their
							withdrawal before such a settlement has been reached would not
							contribute to peace and security in the region but rather lead to
							heightened tensions in an area which has been militarily secure since
							the end of the Korean conflict.</p>
                        <p>e. <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> is a political organ created
							by the United Nations to facilitate the unification of Korea. It has not
							been able to perform its function because of the North Koreans'
							intransigent refusal to accept any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							role in the Korean unification question.</p>
                        <p>f. <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> continues, however, to play
							a useful role in observing the political developments in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and, if the North Korean Regime
							desires, it exists as a channel for discussion of the unification
							question.</p>

                        <p>1. In view of Gen <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>'s recent
							Korean tour I feel that his message to me which follows re US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations is of particular
							significance.</p>
                        <p>“1. There have been a series of events within the past several weeks that
							cause me concern with respect to our relations with the Koreans. Because
							of my past and continuing interest in Korea, I wish to bring to your
							attention my views concerning the importance of ensuring that the
							relationships between our government and the Republic of Korea,
							particularly with respect to the armed forces of our two countries, are
							maintained as closely and as strongly as they have been in the past.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>2. I am referring to a series of announcements, both official and
							unofficial, which may give the Koreans reason to believe that the US is
							losing interest in Korea. These events have added impact on the Koreans
							when taken in context with their desirable but tough decision to
							support, actively, US undertakings in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. Among the items which cause this concern are:</p>
                        <p>A. Senator Russell's recent suggestion that a US division be withdrawn
							from Korea. While I recognize that Senator Russell's statement does not
							represent national policy, it was taken very seriously by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Govt, particularly in view of his
							important position in the Senate. When the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Govt resolved to provide combat troops in <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>, they had official assurance that the
							US would not change its force structure in Korea without prior
							consultation. In addition certain assurances were given to the Korean
							Govt with respect to improving the strength and equipment of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army to accommodate their deployments
							to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> without weakening their defensive
							posture in Korea.</p>
                        <p>B. Temporary personnel drawdowns levied on Eighth Army in order to
							support timely deployments to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> have
							been taken to mean a decreased interest in our contribution to the
							defense and strategic importance of Korea.</p>
                        <p>C. Our continued delay to provide the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Govt with a formal document agreeing to an upward adjustment and
							approved force levels, or some other agreement to compensate for those
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces deployed to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, is undoubtedly being taken by the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> as a sign that we may renege on
							our agreements.</p>
                        <p>D. While not a direct US responsibility, the recent Govt of Turkey (GOT)
							decision to reduce their <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> contingent to
							a token force was strongly opposed by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and their effort to get the GOT to reconsider the
							action did not, in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> view, receive
							any strong US support. The rumored Swiss withdrawal from the ICC is
							still another indicator of declining international interest in the
							problem of Korea. The current move on the part of the Ethiopians to
							withdraw is yet another indication of diminishing international
							interest. There appears to be a constant lessening in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Korea. This is extremely
							important since it is from the UNC that the US acquires <gloss target="#t_OPCON1">OPCON</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss>. No doubt if erosion of multi-national commitment
							continues, we will reach a point when <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will reevaluate their position concerning UNC <gloss target="#t_OPCON1">OPCON</gloss> of <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Korea remains a strong and staunch ally but, like any newly emerging
							democratic nation, requires frequent reassurances of our interest and
							support. We cannot appear to minimize the importance of their in-country
							requirements. The Koreans join us in the recognition of the strategic
							importance of the Korean peninsula to the Western world at this
							particular point in time. Overshadowing as it does the <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0230"/>industrial heartland of Communist
							China, Korea stands in ChiCom eyes as a strong free-world threat to this
							vital area. This hard, cold fact is a principal element of deterrence in

                        <p>2. The visit here is one of comradeship, of tribute to Korea's
							accomplishments, of hope for Korea's future, of highlighting Korea's
							example as one of hope for others in Asia. To ask for more troops would
							be to transform it in President Pak's, and later in Korean public's eyes
							into a case of highlevel arm-twisting.</p>
                        <p>3. President Pak in his talk with me on October 17 (Seoul 2089)<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">In telegram 2089 from Seoul, October 17,
									<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> reported that Pak
								had no particular problems to discuss during the Presidential visit
								and believed “his only purpose would be to ensure the warmest
								possible welcome for President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>.” (National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/JOHNSON)</note> set what he
							considers to be the tone of the visit. A request for more troops would
							come as a severe personal shock to him. The good relationship which Pak
							feels now exists between him and President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> is a great asset for us and should not be
							endangered.</p>
                        <p>4. There is no basis here to corroborate indications that Korean military
							in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> support deployment further Korean
							combat troops there. Certainly it does not represent President Pak's
							thinking nor that of senior Korean military here.</p>
                        <p>5. I do not believe that President Pak or his government, or the National
							Assembly or the people of Korea are ready to send more combat troops to
								<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. On the contrary, many Koreans
							already fear that they may be asked to do so. These fears have been
							expressed <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0232"/>publicly as well as
							privately. Much public stress is being laid here on the fact that Korea
							already has a higher proportion of its population fighting in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> than the US.</p>
                        <p>6. Any suggestion of request for further combat troops would leak sooner

							President Pak's domestic political difficulties, which should not be
							underestimated.</p>
                        <p>7. Therefore I most earnestly recommend that this subject not be raised

                        <p>[Here follows a brief notation recording that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> met privately with President
							Marcos of the Philippines prior to meeting with Pak.]</p>
                        <p>MEMBERS OF PARTY</p>
                        <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Lee; Ambassador Yoo, Korean Ambassador to the
							Philippines; Mr. Lee, Secretary to President Park; Mr. Cho,
							Interpreter</p>
                        <p>The President questioned General Park at some length on what he thought
							might come out of the conference. His response came to this: We must
							leave no stone unturned in persuading our enemies that we remain
							determined that our will has not weakened; but also that we are prepared
							for peace.</p>
                        <p>The President then responded as follows: First, he wished to recognize
							President Park for his role in bringing about the conference, and <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0233"/>to express his gratitude for
							the troops he has sent. They have been magnificent soldiers and a great
							tribute to their nation. Second, he wished to tell President Park of his
							respect and pride for what has been accomplished in Korea in economic,
							social, and political development. It gives us great hope that something
							like that success story might emerge in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We seek peace. The President did not have too much hope right now that
							negotiations could happen. He is also aware that if we seem too anxious
							in this conference, our position might be misinterpreted in Hanoi as a
							sign of weakness.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the President said that there must be no leaks. There are those
							who would wish to pull us apart. We remain united and must stay that
							way. The President went on to say that he wished the world to know also
							that those closest to the danger are also strongest for our present
							course of action.</p>
                        <p>He wants a clear signal to Hanoi that might gain the sympathy of all the
							world from this conference.</p>
                        <p>We shall not escalate or threaten or blackmail. But we must
							altogether—not merely the U.S. but those closest to the danger and
							making the most sacrifice—send a strong signal: This war can't be won in
							Washington or Seoul as the war in 1954 was won in Paris. We must
							demonstrate, above all, our unity and staying power while also
							indicating our willingness to go from the battlefield to the conference,
							provided they reciprocate. We must influence the world to tell Hanoi:
							You cannot win; there is no sense in going on this way.</p>
                        <p>We also wish to let the world know there is an Asia—an Asia where most of
							the people live—where hunger, disease, and poverty are the greatest.</p>
                        <p>We still remain concerned with, and committed to, Europe, but we also
							know there are new men, new leaders, in Asia, like the new leadership in
							Korea, who are determined and capable and whom we can support. The
							President wants from his trip and the conference an awareness around the
							world that a new face has been placed upon Asia. London, Paris, and Bonn
							remain important; but so are Seoul, Tokyo, Manila, Singapore, etc.,
							important.</p>
                        <p>The President then said that he had been fighting discrimination in the
							U.S. and he does not believe that discrimination should be practiced
							among nations.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to his struggle for health, education, and
							higher incomes which must be pursued not merely because it is right for
							people to live better, but because in poverty, ignorance, and disease
							are the root causes of war.</p>
                        <p>The President is interested in getting the Germans, French, British, and
							others, through this conference and this trip—through the highlighting
								<pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0234"/>of the progress in Korea
							and in other places—to put a new spotlight on this area.</p>
                        <p>In short, the President believes, first, we must remain united at this
							conference; secondly, we must demonstrate our determination that we
							shall not pull out and that Hanoi cannot win; third, focus the world's
							attention on the problems of Asia: the new Asia, with new leaders and
							new programs, such as the Asian Development Bank, the Mekong Valley
							development program, etc.</p>
                        <p>As the President said in Australia: You cannot impose freedom on people
							who don't want it; but if they love liberty and freedom, we will stay
							with them and support them. If they don't want freedom, the U.S. can
							look after itself and meet the threat at Honolulu.</p>

									<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, Seoul, and Moscow,
								October 19, discussed the Soviet attempt to debate the Korean item
								at the United Nations and to issue an invitation to North Korean
								representatives. (Ibid.)</note> US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Discussions in Seoul: Korea in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>1. Our one really serious current disagreement with the Koreans concerns
							the handling of the Korean item in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. President Pak and his government feel that it is of vital
							importance to them in this election year to make a good showing in the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without weakening their
							traditional formula. They are likely to raise this with the Secretary or
							possibly with the President in Seoul, and they probably will want to
							deal with it in the communique. For reasons given below, I think we
							should seriously consider raising it with them even if they do not take
							the initiative.</p>
                        <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0235"/>
                        <p>2. The problem is not only a disagreement on tactics to be employed in
							New York, but, more serious for US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							relations, it is a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> conviction that
							the US is growing weary of this problem and is not pushing Korean
							interests as vigorously as the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							might reasonably expect from their most important ally. This feeling,
							which has recently reached a new peak, colors the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reaction to our every suggestion on
							tactics, leads to closed minds on their part with respect to our
							suggestions, and, unless we can restore Korean confidence in our
							understanding of their position and basic support for their objectives,
							can increasingly impair our overall relations.</p>
                        <p>3. To <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and Korean people, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> provides sanction of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> as only legal Government in Korean
							peninsula and basic framework within which <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> functions as active member of international community.
							Voting pattern on Korean item is scrutinized by Korean press as measure
							of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> diplomatic efforts for entire
							year.</p>
                        <p>4. The Koreans feel passionately about the illegitimacy of the North
							Korean regime and have consistently refused to contemplate any direct
							contact with it. They interpret any action by US or others, particularly
							the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, which tends to give any
							legitimacy to this regime, as a denigration of their own internationally
							established sovereignty. They have dug themselves in on a hard line of
							opposing any form of invitation to the North Koreans for discussions in
							New York, not only for the reasons just expressed, but because they feel
							that if they were in the North Korean's shoes they would recognize that
							it would be internationally good tactics for the North Koreans to accept
							an invitation to express their views and they do not want to give them
							any opportunity to do so. They look at this question from a purely
							Korean viewpoint and tend to ignore the important problems and
							responsibilities which the US faces in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, of which the Korean items is only one. They tend also
							to underestimate the difficulties and risks involved for themselves in
							refusing to modify our tactics on this issue. If the choice is between a
							less favorable vote on the substantive resolution and any invitation to
							the North Koreans which might conceivably be accepted, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would choose the former.</p>
                        <p>5. This is a question of emotion, which has been growing deeper over time
							and is now dangerously strong. It is enhanced by our failure to oppose
							the separate inscription on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agenda
							of a Soviet item on Korea calling for withdrawal of US forces and
							dissolution of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>. It fits into
							the pattern of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> thinking that they
							should not have their fate determined by great power interests and they
							suspect that we are reluctant to support the position they advocate
							because of desire to reach a broader accommodation with the Soviet
							Union</p>
                        <p>6. The most recent manifestation of this attitude occurred when an
							Embassy officer attempted on October 22 to discuss the Department's <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0236"/>suggestions for <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> tactics (reftel)<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">The U.S. Embassy official was following the
								Department of State's guidance suggesting that representatives from
								both Koreas be seated in the United Nations as long as North Korea
								“first unequivocally accepts competence and authority of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, under Charter, to consider the
								Korean question.” At the same time, the United States would continue
								to urge its traditional position of supporting the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Korea. The Department
								also suggested approaches to North Korea by the United Nations and
									<gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> as well as by the
									<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> suggesting a unification
								conference. The United States expected all overtures to North Korea
								would be rejected, but believed its tactics would expose North
								Korean intransigence, which would quiet both the North Koreans and
								the Soviets.</note> with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
							International Relations Bureau Director Pak Kun. The moment Pak
							perceived the direction of the Department's thinking, he interrupted
							with a thirty minute emotional speech on the question of basic US
							unwillingness to support the Korean position, which precluded any
							rational discussion of the Department's suggestions.</p>
                        <p>7. It would obviously be impossible and indeed undesirable to attempt to
							discuss strategy or tactics at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							with the Koreans during the President's visit. Nevertheless, the visit
							will provide an opportunity which it is important for us to seize, to
							try to re-convince the Koreans that the US does indeed share their
							objectives with respect to the Korean item in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, that suggestions for changes in tactics are put forward
							as a genuine effort to meet Korean objectives in the light of the
							realities of the situation, that we have not grown weary of the struggle
							to protect their fundamental interests, and to give the Koreans a better
							idea of some of the difficulties which could be presented for them by
							rigid adherence to a static formula in a changing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> situation.</p>
                        <p>8. If through personal talks with the Secretary in Seoul or perhaps even
							the President the old atmosphere of confidence and mutuality of
							interests on fundamentals could be reestablished, future discussions on
							tactics and strategy in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> with the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s could be more fruitful, and a
							potentially serious source of discord between us could be avoided.</p>

							the initiative; but he added that first we must have success in
							Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>He turned then to the problem of the defense of Korea at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. He looks for no aggression from the
							North, but faces chronic problems and incidents. In response to
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s request for
							an example of incidents and incursions, he replied the North Koreans
							tended to create incidents at times when there are other events taking
							place in Asia; for example, at the time of negotiations in Japan there
							were student riots in Korea; before the Manila Conference; before
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s visit.<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">Border incursions occurred during the early
								morning hours of November 2, while President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> was in Korea. In two
								separate incidents <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S.
								patrols encountered and engaged armed units from North Korea. One of
								those encounters resulted in the death of one South Korean and six
								U.S. soldiers and the wounding of several others. The attacks
								brought the number of border skirmishes occurring since October 15
								to 29. (Telegram 2416 from Seoul, November 2; National Archives and
								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–14 KOR) When investigating the
								matter, U.S. personnel in Korea confirmed that on October 26 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces had initiated a raid against
								a North Korean outpost. (Telegram 2417 from Seoul, November 2;
								ibid.) On November 3 <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>
								expressed his disapproval of that action to the Korean Prime
								Minister as being against U.S. policy to uphold the armistice
								agreement and harmful to the prestige of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and the
								court of public opinion. (Telegram 2441 from Seoul, November 3;
								ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> reiterated that
								message in a conversation with the Prime Minister on November 17,
								when discussing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> actions in the
									<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. (Telegram 2691 from Seoul,
								November 18; ibid.)</note> He concluded that at the moment these
							incidents are an irritating factor, but not a serious danger. If
							fighting increases in Vietnam, there may be increased and more sustained
							pressure at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He then turned to the importance of keeping U.S. strength at its present
							level in Korea. The development by the Chicoms of nuclear weapons makes
							the U.S. force necessary as a credible deterrent. Foreign Minister Kishi
							of Japan said that if the U.S. began to withdraw from <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0238"/>Korea, the Socialist movement would
							gain greatly in Japan. The size of the Korean armed forces is beyond the
							capacity of the Korean economy, but they must be given first
							priority.</p>
                        <p>As for the economy itself, there had been a high rate of growth in recent
							years, quite remarkable for a developing nation. The rate of inflation
							had decreased. They were placing great hope and faith in the next 5-year
							plan, in which they expected to raise per capita income to $200; reduce
							unemployment; move toward self-sufficiency and a decline in abnormal
							external assistance. </p>
                        <p>In particular they wished to encourage private capital to come to Korea.
							Korea was a place with a stable economy, and is prepared to welcome
							private capital.</p>
                        <p>These, he said, are his central priorities.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said we share
							his view that the Manila Conference was a success. We had dispatched
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> to enlist the
							understanding and support of others. The most important achievement of
							Manila was that those closest to the danger were most concerned. The
							image had grown in the world—and in the United States—that we were the
							only ones concerned, and this was dangerous. After Manila, the
							multilateral nature of the concern and the course of action in South
							Vietnam would be better understood.</p>
                        <p>We all must not repeat the mistake of the 1930's; but the local people
							must resist aggression seriously. This demonstration is critical in
							American political life.</p>
                        <p>There is no problem with Korea, which is putting up proportionately as
							much as the U.S. But there are relatively few troops from New Zealand,
							Thailand, the Philippines, and Australia.</p>
                        <p>The President underlined that he had not come to Asia to raise troops,
							but that Park had struck at the heart of the problem in posting his
							questions. The longer we “dance away” from facing the problem, the
							greater will be our future difficulties. He (President Park) has an
							election in 1967; President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, in 1968. Our people will support us if we are
							whole-hearted. The opposition will be greater if we appear half-hearted.
							The President noted a decline in the percentage of popular support for
							our Vietnam policy, and added: “We are not moving fast enough for our
							people.” We have all got problems in our countries at the level of
							headaches or a slight fever; but the place where there is a heart attack
							with a nation about to die is Vietnam. If aggression is not contained
							there, it will quickly spread over the whole area. Westmoreland says it
							can't be contained without six to seven hundred thousand troops. If we
							had not present firepower and mobility, we would require many more. The
							measurement of requirements at the technology of five years ago is now
							out of date. What is relevant is the total power <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0239"/>we can apply. In fact, because of new
							technology, we have greater strength everywhere we are committed than we
							did five years ago; for example, in Germany and Korea. Nevertheless, we
							shall need more men in Vietnam, and all of us must think how we can act
							promptly and decisively in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Korean people should know that we have no plans to alter present
							strength here, although the effective power of our forces has sharply
							increased.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							repeated his statement that we have no plans to alter our present
							strength in Korea, but added that future planners must look at effective
							strength and not numbers of men. The President added we should think of
							Westmoreland and how we would feel if we were in his position and asked
							help of the governments: what would we wish the governments to do?</p>
                        <p>President Park then asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to examine some of the economic problems of Korea
							while he is here.<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> met with Korean
								Minister of Finance Kim Hak-yol on November 1. Kim outlined areas in
								which Korea could assist Vietnam, such as by providing
								medical-service teams. He also stated that “if the United States
								could and would pay for them, Korea could also provide technicians
								in agricultural extension, textiles, and electronics.” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> suggested Korea could be
								very helpful in postwar planning and development. Kim also asked for
								U.S. support for Korea's Second Five-year Plan and gave <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> a summary proposal for the
								economic development of Korea that included projects requiring U.S.
								assistance and loans. (Memorandum of conversation, November 1;
								Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File, Korea;
								Memorandum of conversation from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to the President, November 3; ibid., Korea,
								Memos, Vol. III, November 1965 to December 1966)</note> The
							President said that he would ask Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, in whom he had unlimited confidence, to look into
							these matters. If <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> and
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> didn't know more about
							economic problems than he did, the Government was wasting a lot of
							money.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that, next
							to President Park, he was the man most interested in the future of
							Korea. It could not be otherwise. As long as <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> is Secretary of State, the President of the
							United States must be interested in Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had invested a good many years of
							his life here.</p>
                        <p>The President then noted that if they didn't break up the meeting (being
							three-quarters of an hour late), Marvin Watson would throw a Molotov
							cocktail on the table. As the two Presidents walked to the door,
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that on
							military matters they were fully in agreement. On economic matters we
							would explore and see what we could do within limits on aid imposed by
							the United States Congress.</p>

                        <p rend="center">ARMED INCIDENTS ALONG THE KOREAN <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The attack by uniformed North Korean troops on 2 November 1966 against
							a US patrol unit south of the Demilitarized Zone (<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>) was apparently in retaliation for a
							South Korean (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) raid a week earlier.
							Although there has been a marked increase in North Korean harassing
							attacks along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> since mid-October,
							these actions probably do not reflect a decision to engage in wholesale
							violations of the armistice agreement. The targeting of the 2 November
							raid against American troops suggests that Pyongyang was seeking to
							force the US to prevent any repetition of the raid on 26 October by some
							30 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops into the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. There is no evidence that the North Koreans intend to open a “second
							front” in the Vietnam War. However, it is possible that the North
							Koreans believe that heightened tensions along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> would serve as a warning to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the US against further deployments
							of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops to Vietnam and demonstrate
							North Korean support of Hanoi to other Communist states.</p>
                        <p>3. There is no indication that this upsurge of violence was related to
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s visit to
							South Korea. Recent interrogation of apprehended agents indicates these
							attacks had been planned long before the President's Asian trip was
							announced.</p>
                        <p>4. Neither statements by North Korean leaders nor Pyongyang's propaganda
							suggest an intention to divert US attention from Vietnam. Kim Il-song's
							major policy statement on 5 October, although it made the customary
							offer to send “volunteers” to Vietnam, contained no threat to open a
							“second front” in Korea and the US commitment to Seoul probably remains
							an effective deterrent to such action.</p>
                        <p>5. South Korean military officials probably hoped that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> raid, which is claimed to have cost the
							enemy some 30 casualties and may have penetrated through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> into North Korea, would boost morale
							lowered by North Korean incursions. Although the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commander and the US ambassador have warned the South
							Koreans against repetition of such incidents, there is a danger that
							they will undertake carefully concealed reprisals if they suffer further
							personnel losses.</p>
                        <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0242"/>
                        <p>6. The North Korean presentation at the Military Armistice Committee
							meeting held on 4 November at Panmunjom followed the traditional
							propaganda pattern. The senior North Korean representative made no
							direct mention of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> raid, probably
							out of reluctance to call attention to North Korean vulnerabilities or
							to raise the question of North Korean casualties. He did accuse the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> side in general terms of numerous
							border violations.</p>
                        <p>7. The recent upsurge of violence by North Korean infiltrators suggests
							at least a temporary shift of mission from intelligence collection and
							subversion to harassment. In the past, infiltration agents—usually in
							civilian clothes—rarely engaged in fire-fights except when challenged by
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military or security services.
							Since mid-October, however, infiltration teams have deliberately sought
							out and attacked <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. These
							probing operations may have been designed to test the effectiveness and
							reaction of South Korean forces deployed along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> as well as to undermine troop
							morale.</p>
                        <p>8. North Korean agent operations along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> have been conducted with varying intensity since the
							armistice agreement in 1953. In the past year, larger teams and more
							heavily armed operatives have been used. Agent teams began concentrated
							operations in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> last May. After
							the abnormal period of inactivity in September and early October
							probably caused by heavy rains and agent losses, North Korean
							infiltrators carried out seven surprise attacks against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in a five-day period beginning
							on 13 October. By 2 November, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US
							forces had suffered some 36 fatalities (six US) in 40 incidents this
							year as compared with 20 Korean soldiers killed in 55 incidents in 1965
							and four in 32 incidents during 1964.</p>
                        <p>9. The harassment along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> is
							expected to taper off during the next few weeks as the foliage
							disappears and snow begins to fall. Normally, agent operations during
							the November–February period are infrequent because of bad weather.</p>

                        <p>Before coming out here I discussed with you the strategic importance of
							Korea as a significant element in the overall deterrent against the
							ChiComs (and North Koreans) more overtly intervening in South East Asia.
							I suggested that, even though completely supporting the concentration of
							our resources to meet Vietnam requirements and the needs of the training
							base, we should be careful not to let the military power of our Korean
							element of our overall strategy vis-a-vis Communist China fall to the
							point where its credibility is affected.</p>
                        <p>Except in the area of army aviation, particularly helicopter pilots,
							where we are scheduled to fall severely below a safe minimum, and in
							ammunition war reserves, particularly illuminating rounds, I am not
							gravely concerned at our military capability here to fight a major
							conventional action not involving massive ChiCom reinforcements. You
							know status of possible US reinforcements better than I.</p>
                        <p>However, it is not what we can do but what the ChiComs and North Koreans
							think we can do that will affect their further actions regarding
							Vietnam. The North Koreans and to a degree the ChiComs, unlike the

                        <p>There follows an interesting tidbit for what it is worth. It was said by

                        <p>88135. Exclusive for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> Eyes Only. State/Defense message.</p>
                        <p>1. We are planning to build a physical barrier in South Vietnam south of
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. Current plans are for
							construction to commence in mid-February with a targeted completion date
							of late May. This is a highly classified and sensitive matter.</p>
                        <p>2. A nine infantry battalion division plus logistic element augmentation
							(about 16,500 men) will be required to man the hilly and rugged,
							intermittent western portion of this barrier.</p>
                        <p>3. We note that Pak told President that it would be easy to reactivate
							almost immediately a division of recent army veterans for combat use. We
							wish now to pursue with Pak this concept of an anti-infiltration Korean
							division, possibly made up of veterans. While Pak could be told about
							the barrier, our intention would be to say in wider circles only that
							the Korean division would be “to help prevent infiltration through the
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.”</p>
                        <p>4. We recognize that it might be necessary to put such a volunteer <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division into a special category with
							greater pay and benefits than received at present by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops, that such special treatment
							might create morale problems among already deployed third-nation troops,
							and that we would have to face a Korean attempt to increase the 600,000
							troop ceiling.</p>
                        <p>5. Obtaining this anti-infiltration combat division is of utmost
							importance in view of limits on other manpower availabilities. It is
							obviously not the same as the civilian logistics service corps concept.
							That idea needs substantial refinement before a definitive comment on
							its merits can be made. And presumably would be dropped at least for the
							time being if 16,500 additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							combat troops supplied.</p>
                        <p>6. New <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division ideally should be in
								<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> not later than 1 April 1967.
							While we recognize that upcoming elections in Korea might make
							impossible dispatch of regular <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							troops by that time, we wonder whether purely volunteer status of new
							division would make early recruitment and deployment possible. In any
							event, in order to <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0248"/>program
							construction and US deployments it is highly desirable to secure
							commitment from Pak not later than 1 January 1967 that deployment could
							be made by 1 July 1967.</p>
                        <p>7. By mid-1967 about .25% of US population will be in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> actively engaged in war in Vietnam; an
							equivalent Korean contribution would be about 72,500 men. Further, by
							mid-1967 over 20% of US ground forces will be in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>; Korean equivalent would be over 100,000. We conclude
							that it is entirely reasonable to expect further Korean combat
							contribution to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> and that it should
							not be necessary for US to pay too stiff economic or political price for
							this contribution.</p>

                                <ref target="#d100">Document 100</ref>.</note> I have discussed
							reftel with General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>. We fully understand the importance of securing

                            <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, and the time urgency involved.</p>
                        <p>We consider the following considerations to be relevant.</p>
                        <p>1. After President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s visit
							President Pak personally gave a firm assurance to the Korean people that
							no further Korean combat troops have been requested or are being
							considered for <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">On November 10 Pak announced during an informal
								press conference that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
								not provide additional combat troops to serve in Vietnam. (Telegram
								2589 from Seoul, November 13; National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET S)</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0249"/>
                        <p>2. This assurance has been received with satisfaction by all political
							parties and by all sections of Korean opinion, which have been unanimous
							in expressing opposition to the despatch of further Korean combat troops
							to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. The fact that the further contribution suggested reftel would consist
							of volunteers would not make their despatch acceptable. The Koreans will
							feel that troops that will be assigned to frontline duties and have to
							fight are combat troops, whether volunteers or conscripts. Many are
							already arguing that the volunteer rear area guard and logistic units
							now being considered will also have, in effect, a combat mission.</p>
                        <p>4. No preparations for recruitment, training and deployment of a
							volunteer division could be made without public knowledge.</p>
                        <p>5. A key point made by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in his discussions in Seoul was that he was not
							here, nor for that matter had he made his Asian trip, to ask our allies
							in Vietnam to increase their forces there. He stressed that he wanted
							them to understand Westmoreland's problems—put themselves in his
							shoes—and think about what they could do to increase their effort in
							Vietnam. He went on to say that after elections in the U.S. and Korea we
							would have to work on this problem.</p>
                        <p>6. Pak, on his part, pointed out to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> that he expected to be given a rough time before
							next year's elections by his political opposition because Korea was the
							only Asian nation with a large troop commitment in Vietnam. In saying
							this Pak was reflecting the feeling of many Koreans that Korea has
							already made a disproportionate force contribution to the Vietnam
							effort. Pak, no doubt in a sincere desire to be forthcoming, did respond
							to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s suggestion
							of calling up <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reservists for combat
							duty in Vietnam as an aspect of easing the unemployment problem. Here
							again, however, the context of the discussion was that this was
							something to be discussed after elections.</p>
                        <p>7. You will recall that President Pak was visibly shaken by our request
							for a second division so soon after his agreement to send the first,
							mainly because of the political difficulties with which the despatch of
							the first division was confronting him. Pak is facing an election in
							May. To win it, particularly by a sufficient margin to establish him in
							firm control, may not be as easy as many like to think. The Korean
							people have accepted the fact that their government decided to send
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to Vietnam and are proud
							of their record there. This should not mislead us into believing that
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> support of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> is a popular active cause in this
							country. Opposition leaders are already calling for some form of
							withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces now in
								<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. For Pak to agree now to send
							more combat troops, particularly in the face of his recent public
							assurances, would undoubtedly damage his election chances. It might even
							cost him the election.</p>
                        <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>8. Moreover, no one, not even Pak, knows what may happen between now and
							the election, either on the domestic scene, or in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, or along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> had previously informed
								Washington that political problems surrounding the dispatch of more
								troops had been compounded by the increase in the number of
								incidents along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, a
								combination that significantly diminished any possibility that more
								Korean troops would serve in Vietnam. (Telegram 2613 from Seoul,
								November 14; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET
								S)</note> Pak does not know what pledges he may feel it necessary to
							make to his people in order to get re-elected. He cannot accurately
							predict the power position in which he will find himself after elections
							because he does not know the margin by which he will be re-elected, nor
							the degree of <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> support which he will
							have in the new Assembly. Thus he is in no position to make a
							pre-election commitment for further troop despatch which is worth
							anything even if he wanted to do so.</p>
                        <p>9. Therefore, for President Pak now to receive a request for more combat
							troops would, I am convinced, seem to him an embarrassing and unfriendly
							disregard for his political problems, which are well known to us.</p>
                        <p>10. Re para 7 reftel, the Koreans will not think it reasonable, but
							rather most unreasonable, that a country of Korea's small size and
							limited resources should be asked to contribute to the South Vietnamese
							war as large a proportion of their population and armed forces as a
							great power like the U.S. This is especially true of a small country
							directly [across] the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> from a
							substantial and well-armed North Korean force and almost next door to
							vast ChiCom forces.</p>
                        <p>11. The Koreans feel that they have already made a disproportionately
							great contribution to the war in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.
							When they refer to the fact that their contribution in terms of
							percentage of population is approximately the same as that of the U.S.,
							they are emphasizing how exceedingly great their contribution is, not
							how reasonable it is. They feel that any pressure for further combat
							troops should be applied to gain a more equal contribution by other
							Asian and Pacific countries which they consider equally affected by
							aggression in Vietnam and which do not have a long frontier with the
							Communist countries manned by opposing armies.</p>
                        <p>12. An unexpressed major premise of the argument in para 7 may well be
							that the present Korean forces in Korea are too large. Whatever we may
							think of this, the Koreans simply do not agree. On the contrary, both
							government and public feel that their present forces should be stronger
							than they now are in light of the increased risk they feel they have
							incurred by their contribution in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0251"/>
                        <p>13. The arguments in para 7 would seem particularly outrageous to the
							Koreans if coupled with any indication that we would be reluctant to
							provide them with iron-clad assurances of continued long term support
							and pay generously for any further contribution out of our vastly
							superior resources. Even if the government wished to avoid this attitude
							they could not get away with it with their assembly, press and public
							opinion. You will recall that President Pak had to ask for an “economic
							plus” to get Assembly approval of the second division.</p>
                        <p>14. Very importantly, it appears to me that we are in danger of seeming
							to take the Koreans for granted and of trying to do it on the cheap.
							They will recall that, as I mentioned in my message from Hong Kong last
							February (Hong Kong 1489 to Department),<note n="5" xml:id="d101fn5">
                                <ref target="#d79">Document 79</ref>.</note> we first asked for a
							small medical unit and got it. Then we asked for non-combat troops and
							got 2,000. Then we asked for a combat division and got that. Before the
							ink was dry on the agreement for the first combat division we asked for
							a second combat division and ultimately got that. Now we would be asking
							for another 16,500 combat men. The Koreans will wonder when and where
							this will end and why others are not pressed to do likewise.</p>
                        <p>15. If we wish continuance of the attitude of whole-hearted support we
							are now getting from the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>, we will be well advised to avoid any
							action which would make them feel that we are taking undue advantage of
							their willingness to cooperate, or are giving insufficient weight to
							their concern about the security problems which they feel they now face
							and which they are sure will persist for them even after a settlement in
								<gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>16. Consequently, it is my conviction, in which General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> concurs, that the best
							way to preserve the chances of securing our objective of further combat
							troop contribution from Korea, is to wait to raise this question with
							Pak until after the election.</p>
                        <p>17. If we ask President Pak for more combat forces now we risk a flatly
							negative reply, coupled with a personal sense of being imposed upon
							which would mar the [garble—effect of?] President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s visit, especially on Pak
							personally, and endanger the sincere support we are now receiving from
							the Koreans in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>18. Pak will probably be expecting such a request after election. He may
							be disposed to cooperate providing he can get what he would consider
							adequate remuneration and particularly long-term security assurances.
							His demands on these points will be large and will undoubtedly include
							genuine and speedy modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces. We will have to be prepared to be very
							forthcoming.</p>
                        <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>
                        <p>19. After election Pak will be in a better position to respond
							affirmatively if he wants to do so. Even then a favorable response is by
							no means a certainty. What is much more certain is that if we make a
							request to him prematurely at a time when he is likely to consider it an

                        <p>1. Evidence to date appears to indicate <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							regime and its supporters are conducting better organized and apparently
							more vigorous assault on US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position
							in Korean unification debate than in previous years. On basis reports of
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> and other Communist propaganda
							output we suspect there may be a new tactic employed by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> and Soviet Bloc this year, namely, to
							seek to eliminate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Korea
							(UNC and <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss>) or, at minimum,
							during course of debate so impugn integrity of these <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> agencies that next year Soviet effort in
								<gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> may have more
							sympathizers.</p>
                        <p>2. The Department is fully aware of actions taken by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> and Soviets, both within and outside the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> framework, to enhance the
							prospects for defeating US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position
							on Korean item and is in better position to evaluate prospects of Soviet
							success if the debate follows traditional pattern. However, if the
							Soviets have estimated they cannot win confrontation with us on basic
							reunification issue, they may decide on gaining only limited goal this
							year. One way to tilt the scales in their favor is by attacking
							integrity of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Korea,
							particularly if they can demonstrate abuses and actions by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> instrumentalities <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0254"/>that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							members would disapprove or at a minimum frown upon.</p>
                        <p>3. It seems to us that an approach of this type by Soviets would focus on
							the following three areas:</p>
                        <p>A. Military Armistice Agreement Violations.</p>
                        <p>(1) Radio Pyongyang and other Communist propaganda outlets have placed
							growing emphasis on allegations of US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> violations along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.
							As Department aware, we have indications that there probably have been a
							small number of forays across the <gloss target="#t_MDL1">MDL</gloss> by
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces. The <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> regime probably has photographic and
							physical evidence to prove that such attacks by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces occurred. (In a number of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> raids into the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> area,
							they have stripped <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US bodies of
							personal belongings and pocket litter. This type of item, which is
							difficult to fabricate, would make dramatic evidence to support <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> charges.) Soviets or other Bloc country
							could introduce charges of Armistice Agreement violations by UNC forces
							during Korean item debate and then produce evidence provided by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> to prove charges. Since <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces are under UNC operational
							control, the Soviets could then make case in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces themselves are violating the armistice agreement
							which they pledged to uphold and urge withdrawal <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence.</p>
                        <p>(2) In meeting these charges, we could, of course, point to the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> violations, particularly the spate of
							incidents along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> in late October
							and early November. In this connection, it is necessary for us to bear
							in mind that we cannot prove with any evidence, nor for that matter do
							we have intelligence information, that military personnel of the North
							Korean armed forces conducted those raids. The best we can argue is that
							such incidents were either the consequences of crossings by North Korean
							intelligence agents or infiltrations conducted by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> armed personnel, probably from the Reconnaissance
							Bureau. It may be a fine point but it is important to be aware that
							Reconnaissance Bureau personnel are civilians, though uniformed, and not
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> armed forces personnel. Some
							elements of the Reconnaissance Bureau, however, are under the
							operational control of the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> field
							command. In brief, we have no evidence or intelligence information to
							charge that the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> regime breached the
							Military Armistice agreement by undertaking actions into <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory with military personnel of
							the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> armed forces.</p>
                        <p>(3) The distinction between the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> violations may be a fine one but we
							believe that those members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> who
							are unenthusiastic or are fence sitters on the Korean items may be less
							outraged by violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> made
							by espionage and civilian reconnaissance agents than they would be by an
							out-and-out violation of the agreement by purely military personnel from
							regular military formations.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0255"/>
                        <p>B. Abuse of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Authority.</p>
                        <p>Reports from a number of posts indicate that the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> regime and other Communist nations have seized upon the
							fact that a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> unit landed in Vietnam,
							carrying a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flag. We expect that the
							Soviets and others will be looking for other evidence of such
							unauthorized use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> name, its flag
							or other symbol as ammunition to argue against the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence in Korea. The Soviets may well
							seize upon <gloss target="#t_VUNC1">VUNC</gloss> as another example of
							an unauthorized activity conducted in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> name.</p>
                        <p>C. UNC: Operational Control of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Forces.</p>
                        <p>(1) The Soviets could also seize upon UNC operational control of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces for exploitation. They could
							point out that the UNC, a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							instrumentality, has operational control over the armed forces of a
								non-<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> nation, an action going beyond
							the authority of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution.
							Though this practice has existed since the Korean War. We are unaware of
							any action by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, per se, to
							authorize it.</p>
                        <p>(2) We should also be aware that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							resolution called only for a “Unified Command” and the phrase “United
							Nations Command” does not appear in any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolutions. “UNC” appears to have been adopted at the
							beginning of the Korean War as a name for the “Unified Command” solely
							as a unilateral action by the US and, though unchallenged over the
							years, is, nevertheless, without <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							sanction.</p>
                        <p>3. In this era of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peace-keeping forces
							in various parts of the world, the UNC is an anomaly in terms of its
							relationships to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Admittedly the
							Korean arrangement is unique in that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> placed the Unified Command “under the United States,”
							requested the US to appoint a commander and requested the US to make
							reports to the Security Council, all in recognition that major
							hostilities were underway. Now that hostilities have been over for
							thirteen years, the Soviets could argue that the pattern established for
							other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peace-keeping forces in their
							relationships with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be
							followed or UNC should be stripped of its <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cloak.</p>
                        <p>4. It can be argued that much of the foregoing is based on
							“hairsplitting” and highly legalistic contentions. Nevertheless, if the
							Soviets wish to obfuscate the basic issue during the Korean unification
							debate, they could, by adopting any or all of the approaches outlined
							above, hit us in areas where we are vulnerable and would be on the
							defensive. Given the sense of ennui on the Korean item that <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> reports is present among some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members and the lack of interest in this
							item on the part of many new <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members,
							this new approach by the Soviets could attract new and undesired type of
							interest, particularly since the US would be cast in the wrongdoer's
							role. In a forum such as the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>,
							arguments based on highly legalistic interpretations often find more
							favor than those based on moral justification.</p>
                        <p>5. We recognize that the foregoing is speculative but it is within the
							realm of possibility. Because it is potentially, and could be
							sufficiently, <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0256"/>damaging, we
							believe that thought should be given to the tactics we and the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should use in reply. It also raises
							the question as to whether we should initiate actions, at the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, such as charging the Communists with
							violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> in order to
							preempt the possibility of their charging us with violations.</p>
                        <p>6. Department and <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> in better
							position to determine whether any action should be taken. We have not
							discussed any of the foregoing with the Foreign Minister since the
							Ministry does not appear to be aware of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forays across the <gloss target="#t_MDL1">MDL</gloss>.
							If the above speculation appears reasonable, the Department may wish to
							discuss matter on a personal and private basis with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Foreign Minister to insure that he is
							aware of dangers and to assure his advice on tactics.</p>

                        <p>On December 1, 1966, Korean officials presented to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> the Korean Government's proposal
							for providing additional assistance in Vietnam. The plan, entitled
							“Proposed Support Program to Pacification Plan of <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss>,” consisted of three components: (1)
							“Support for Stable Life of <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> People,”
							centering on refugee resettlement; medical assistance and social welfare
							programs; development of agriculture, fishing, and light industry;
							cultural exchanges and a campaign against illiteracy; and a village
							project; (2) “National Construction: Rehabilitation and Construction of
							Military Establishments,” a civilian service corps consisting of Korean
							workers; and (3) “Assistance to Military Efforts,” with Korea providing
							a civilian paramilitary unit to carry out support duties within Vietnam
							and training for Vietnamese military personnel at facilities within
							Korea. (Telegram 2970 from Seoul, December 3; National Archives and
							Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27 VIET S)</p>
                        <p>After reviewing the proposals, the Embassy concluded that component (1)
							“fit well into the Vietnamese 'Revolutionary Development' Program,”
							addressed several important needs, and could be advantageously fulfilled
							by the Koreans, who were “more likely fit readily into and more apt gain
							acceptance of local Vietnamese societies” than Caucasians from the
							United States or elsewhere. The Embassy considered component (2) both a
							continuation of current programs and a significantly more ambitious, and
							unrealistic, project envisaging between 20 and 50,000 Korean workers
							being sent to Vietnam as laborers. <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0257"/>The Embassy acknowledged the potential value of
							providing military training to Vietnamese in Korea, but believed the
							planned paramilitary unit would appear to be an escalation of Korea's
							military role in Vietnam and unnecessarily create political opposition
							to President Pak. (Telegram 2971 from Seoul, December 3; ibid.)</p>

                        <p>Mr. Colby said that his staff had done an analysis of the recent upsurge
							in North Korean attacks across the demilitarized zone and had come to
							the conclusion that these attacks might signal the adoption of a new
							North Korean policy which might culminate in an all-out attack.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">[<hi rend="italic">text not
								declassified</hi>] (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files, Country Files, East Asia and
								Pacific General File, East Asia Reviews, 1964–1966)</note> The fact
							that the North Korean party had recently held a congress during which
							they decided to draw away from the Chinese Communists, but without
							joining up with the Soviets, seemed to support this conclusion. Mr.
							Colby said he was not fully persuaded of the correctness of this
							analysis; Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed that the situation did
							not appear to have developed to a point warranting these judgments. Mr.
								<persName>Bundy</persName> went on to say that General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> had vigorously argued for
							the conclusion that the North Koreans had adopted a new aggressive
							policy. The General also called for some retaliatory action to protect
							his troops. One could sympathize with the General, but here again Mr.
								<persName>Bundy</persName> did not find himself in agreement. Mr.
								<persName>Bundy</persName> said, however, that he thought perhaps
							the General was right in believing that the <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0258"/>North Koreans were attacking and trying to infiltrate
							South Korea in order to do what they could to disrupt the April
							elections. The opposition in South Korea had been claiming for some time
							that South Korean strength was not sufficient to protect the country.
							The North Korean strategy appeared to be tailored to aid the
							opposition.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> visited Tokyo December

							1966.</p>
                        <p>You will note that as of November 30 the on-ground strength was 43,748,

                        <p>1. In response to the Secretary's question whether the outcome of the
							voting on the Korean item would affect the elections, the Foreign
							Minister replied that a defeat would have had a profound negative impact
							on the government's position.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">The
									U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-UNC resolutions on the
								Korean items were all upheld. Details of the resolutions and voting
								results are in Yearbook of the United Nations: 1966, pp.
								138–146.</note> In his opinion, neither Yu Chin-o nor Yun Po-son had
							much chance of defeating President Pak, but “an election is an
							election.” He believed that the main issues in the elections would be
							Korean participation in Viet-Nam and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan relations. The Secretary asked whether the recent
							smuggling case would have an effect. Lee replied affirmatively, stating
							that the two primary factors in that case were President Pak's
							determination to treat the culprits on a legal rather than a political
							basis and the widespread popular interest in effective government.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Bilateral Ministerial Meetings</p>
                        <p>2. The Foreign Minister proposed that his government and the United
							States initiate annual bilateral ministerial meetings similar to those
							held by the United States with Japan and Canada. Since the U.S.
							representatives visited Tokyo once a year for this purpose, there was no
							reason why they should not proceed to Seoul during the same trip. The
							existing lines of communication between the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government and the United States Government were
							excellent; therefore, such meetings <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0261"/>would bring no additional substantive benefits. They
							would, however, make a good public impression and would heighten the
							prestige of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. The
							Secretary's assent to this proposal would be a Christmas souvenir for
							the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. The holding of the first such
							meeting prior to the Korean elections would be a helpful gesture by the
							United States which would give President Pak “a shining face” prior to
							the elections.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary replied that he hoped this proposal would not be made
							publicly. He wanted the Foreign Minister to know that he believes such
							meetings are not a very efficient way in which to transact business. The
							agenda has a tendency to become overcrowded and there is usually
							insufficient time to cover the agenda items properly. The Secretary said
							he would think about Lee's proposal but he was convinced that individual
							talks with individual ministers were a highly preferable way of
							transacting business.<note n="3" xml:id="d106fn3">In a summary of this
								conversation, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted: “We
								do not favor this proposal and believe it would be particularly
								inopportune and almost impossible to arrange prior to Korean
								elections.” (Telegram 105138 to Seoul, December 19; National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1964–66,

                        <p>4. The Foreign Minister then asked that the United States Government make
							some public gesture which would be interpreted in Korea as support for
							President Pak in his campaign for reelection. The Secretary asked if
							public opinion in Korea regarding the United States would be helpful to
							the government in the elections. Lee replied that this would definitely
							be the case and that the Secretary had seen for himself during President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s recent visit to
							Korea the deep feeling for the United States which existed among the
							Korean populace. Ambassador Kim added that, in his opinion, the U.S.
							attitude toward President Pak and his administration will determine the
							results of the election. Later, as the Foreign Minister was leaving, he
							asked when the Secretary was planning to visit Seoul. The Secretary
							replied that he had no immediate plans for doing so inasmuch as he had
							just been there. The Foreign Minister urged the Secretary to consider
							the possibility of going to Seoul and publicly praising Pak's
							leadership, prior to the election.<note n="4" xml:id="d106fn4">The
								second part of this discussion focused on Vietnam, <gloss target="#t_ASPAC1">ASPAC</gloss>, SEATO, and developments in
								China. (Memorandum of conversation, Part II of II, December 19;

                        <p>1. We recognize and accept cogency of arguments you advance in refs A and
							B. We are aware of public statements by President Pak and <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> Kim that no more <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops will be sent to Viet-Nam. Also
							aware of Pak's December 17 press conference statement that military
							aspect of Viet-Nam war has passed crest and that there no longer any
							doubt who will win.<note n="4" xml:id="d107fn4">A summary of Pak's
								comments was transmitted in telegram 3258 from Seoul, December 20.
								(National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1 KOR S)</note> We
							recognize political difficulties with which Pak would be faced if we
							asked him to publicly commit more troops <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0263"/>prior to June elections. We also understand dangers of
							seeking private commitment from Pak now to be made public following
							elections.</p>
                        <p>2. Nevertheless, our primary objective for additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> contributions to Viet-Nam is to secure
							more combat troops. We are concerned that too rapid negotiation or
							acceptance of Korean officers of non-military or para-military
							additional participation in Viet-Nam may lead <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to believe our desires can be satisfied by such
							programs. On other hand, we have noted your comment para 5 ref B that
							such additional involvement might contribute to psychological climate
							making possible additional military contribution after elections.<note n="5" xml:id="d107fn5">In paragraph 5 of telegram 2760 from Seoul,
								November 22, 1966, <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>
								wrote that with regard to expanded Korean involvement in Vietnam
								“the only path which appears likely to be successful is the
								non-military one. It is now beyond the realm of possibility that
								this added involvement could, after election, contribute to a
								psychological climate in which it might be possible to get further
								troop contributions.”</note> While we see merit in some of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> proposals, our final positions
							regarding U.S. financial support for them will depend importantly upon
							President Park's attitude toward despatching an additional division to
							Viet-Nam later in 1967. That division is what we really want.</p>
                        <p>3. Problem is complicated by fact that U.S. deployments to Viet-Nam may
							level off after mid-1967. Public discussion following <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> elections of despatch of additional
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops might thus coincide with
							publicity regarding stabilization of U.S. effort in Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. It occurs to us that one approach to solving this dilemma would be for
							you to have frank informal chat with Pak. In course of conversation you
							might make following points:</p>
                        <p>a. As President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, Premier
							Ky, and General Westmoreland have indicated, more Free World forces are
							necessary in Viet-Nam to bring struggle to early favorable
							conclusion;</p>
                        <p>b. Accordingly, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							has decided to increase U.S. forces there during <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 67 to level 35 percent above that existing at time of
							Manila Conference. This for President Pak's private information and no
							one else. This will result in participation in Viet-Nam of about 25
							percent of all U.S. ground forces by end <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1967 and we would be hard pressed to further increase
							ground forces, in view commitments elsewhere, including Korea. About .27
							percent of U.S. population will be involved in Viet-Nam by end 1967. An
							equivalent Korean contribution in Viet-Nam would be in excess of
							70,000.</p>
                        <p>c. Additional troops will be needed for various purposes. One requirement
							will be for troops to man a physical barrier in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, for
							which plans now being developed. Size and character of additional
							manpower requirements for this barrier will depend on decisions yet to
							be made on the form the barrier will take. U.S. and <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0264"/>GVN forces will both be employed in
							this undertaking but Korean anti-infiltration training and experience
							could be particularly valuable in this type of assignment. This is one
							possible area for employment of additional Korean troops;</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> welcomes <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> proposals to send non-military or para-military forces
							to participate in <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss> pacification
							program. We hope agreement can be reached on arrangements both useful in
							SVN and beneficial to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. However, we
							regard such participation as additive to, rather than as substitute for
							more combat troops;</p>
                        <p>e. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be prepared to support
							additional troops in whatever form was most desirable from <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> viewpoint;</p>
                        <p>f. We hope <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> could provide as soon as
							possible after <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> elections an
							additional division, perhaps composed of volunteer veterans;</p>
                        <p>g. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> knows that Pak is confronted by
							elections and that this makes it difficult for him to make any
							commitment now. However, in order that we may make our fiscal, manpower
							and other plans for 1967 we are at this time asking if President Pak
							would be prepared to make a tentative commitment for the despatch of
							another division to Viet-Nam later in 1967.</p>
                        <p>5. Request your comment on approach suggested para 4 above or any
							alternative suggestions you may have for expediting <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> decision to send another division to
							Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>Because of my responsibilities in connection with the Outer Space Treaty,
							I was able to visit only five countries on the first leg of the trip to
							Asia and to spend a shorter time in each one than I would have desired:
							one day each in Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, two and a half days
							in Japan, and three days in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. Korea</p>
                        <p>In Korea, I talked to both the President and the Prime Minister with
							candor about the difficulties of preventing some action within the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which would denigrate Korea's
							standing in the international community; I noted that composition of the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is far different now than it was
							in the 1950's; that many Afro-Asians were inclined to avoid taking sides
							in disputes they see as US-Soviet “cold war” disputes; that others are
							tempted to side with North Korea to encourage its continued movement
							away from Peking toward Moscow; and, finally, that our intimate
							connection with Korea can mean that African dissatisfaction with the US
							on issues vital to them, but quite extraneous to the Korean problem, can
							adversely affect African support of the joint US-Korean position on the
							Korean problem.</p>
                        <p>I believe this explanation, plus assurances I gave that US is not
							prepared to sacrifice Korean interests in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or elsewhere for the sake of getting along with the
							Soviets, has helped to dispel suspicion among the Koreans that our
							doubts about continuing with the same tactics on the Korean question in
							the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> may stem from a desire to reach a
							detente with the Soviets and a willingness to sacrifice Korean interests
							in the process.</p>

							tell President Park and the Korean people how impressed he was with the
							courage, friendship, gallantry, and love of freedom evinced by the
							people of Korea. Moreover, General Westmoreland has said that there are
							no finer fighting men in Viet-Nam than the Korean troops there, and the

							boys just how proud we all are of the job they are doing in
							Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The President said he would be going to Guam to discuss matters of
							personnel, planning and the pacification program with Ambassador Lodge
							and General Westmoreland; he would be leaving next Saturday night (March
							18). The President was aware that the Prime Minister had been in
							Viet-Nam not long ago and would want to hear the Prime Minister's
							impressions of the situation there.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wanted to talk about what Korea might be able to do
							in Viet-Nam after the Korean elections—not only explore the possibility
							of sending more military forces, but also civilian groups. The President
							noted the great contribution which Korea has already made in Viet-Nam:
							he said it had been an impossible job, which the Koreans had done
							magnificently. The problem now, the President said, <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0268"/>is to get our men out of Viet-Nam as
							soon as possible. It is not only essential to finish the military job
							quickly, but also to work toward building up civil institutions—creating
							a proper environment for elections and transferring power to a civilian
							government. In this connection, the experience of the Koreans in recent
							years will be of great value to us and to the Vietnamese. We need to
							concentrate on the civilian programs. The President said he was hoping
							for more help in this regard from Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
							others. The President asked the Prime Minister's views regarding this
							matter.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, the President pointed out that he was sending Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to Korea on March 16.<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2">

							The President said he was very anxious that this mission be successful,

                        <p>The Prime Minister then presented to the President a personal letter from

							Korean Government to see how we can join together in our efforts.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Prime Minister when the Korean elections would be
							held. The Prime Minister replied that the elections were scheduled for
							May 3. The President asked if the Government were having any troubles.
							The Prime Minister replied that, although the opposition was now united,
							President Park was very popular and respected by the people. The Prime
							Minister expected that President Park would enjoy a majority of a few
							million votes. The President asked if Viet-Nam were a difficult issue
							for the Government. The Prime Minister said it was, but that the
							normalization of relations with Japan was the biggest issue for the
							opposition. The President asked if President Park would make it all
							right; the Prime Minister said that he would—with President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s help.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that he wanted to discuss the modernization of
							Korean forces, and had three specific requests:</p>
                        <p>(a) The Prime Minister requested that Korean helicopter pilots be trained
							for duty in Viet-Nam in conjunction with Korean forces there. The Prime
							Minister noted that, at present, American helicopter pilots are being
							used to transport <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops, but said
							that the problem of language was hampering the efficiency of this
							operation. The President said he would talk with the Defense Department
							about this problem.</p>
                        <p>(b) The Prime Minister referred to the recent sinking of a Korean navy
							vessel by a North Korean shore batteries and said that Korea needs one
							more destroyer. The Prime Minister said there was a danger that the
							North Koreans would intensify their espionage and other military
							activities in the pre-election period. The day before the Prime Minister
							left Korea (March 9) three North Korean agents had been apprehended. The
							Prime Minister believed that more and more of these agents would be sent
							down to the South as the elections grew nearer. The Prime Minister
							repeated his request for a “small” destroyer as soon as possible. He
							said the destroyers presently in service in the Korean navy had been in
							use since 1946 and were the oldest type still in operation. Their speed
							was only in the 18–24 knot range, and they were simply not competitive
							as compared with North Korean naval equipment.</p>
                        <p>(c) Referring to President Park's letter to the Prime Minister described
							to the President the importance to Korean troops of kimchi, which he
							said was vitally important to the morale of Korean troops. The Prime
							Minister said that, when he had been in the United States at the Command
							and General Staff College he had longed for kimchi even more than he had
							longed for his wife back in Korea. Similarly, the Korean troops in
							Viet-Nam vitally needed their kimchi. Last Christmas President Park had
							sent some kimchi to the troops in Viet-Nam, paying <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0270"/>the expense out of his own pocket. To
							supply sufficient quantities of kimchi would cost something like $3–4
							million per year. The Prime Minister apologized for raising what he said
							appeared to be a minor matter but said that President Park had
							specifically asked him to mention the problem to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> started to
							proceed to the Cabinet Room, the Prime Minister said he had one last
							request to make. In view of the importance of developing the Korean
							economy—which President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							himself had often stressed—it is vital that Korean exports to all parts
							of the world be increased, especially to the United States. The Prime
							Minister proposed that an annual meeting of the Korean Minister of
							Commerce and Industry and the US Secretary of Commerce be
							instituted.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that this matter is very important to his
							Government. The President said that we will accept this proposal.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Prime Minister ended their private conversation at
							this point, proceeding to meet with the rest of the official party in
							the Cabinet Room.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>All of us here were delighted to have the Prime Minister here for a
							visit, and to talk with him and his colleagues on a variety of subjects
							in which we have a common interest. We now have a better understanding
							of your main concerns and problems, and I think the Prime Minister and
							his party left with a better understanding of ours.</p>
                        <p>The various departments are now examining the matters which were raised
							and we shall be in touch with your government when we have finished
							these studies. As I told the Prime Minister, we cannot help in all
							respects, but I assure you that we shall do what we can.</p>
                        <p>In your letter of March 8,<note n="2" xml:id="d112fn2">See <ref target="#d110fn3">footnote 3, Document 110</ref>.</note> you
							spoke of your desire to do more in the civilian area in Viet Nam and to
							help in the pacification program. The 120 Korean medical people working
							in the provinces on health programs are doing excellent work, as are the
							several thousand Koreans on various contract projects. Specific new
							projects in which a Korean effort would be both practical and beneficial
							are under study, and our people will soon be discussing these with your
							officials and the Vietnamese government. There are certain problems: the
							South Vietnamese capacity to absorb additional ventures, the
							inflationary impact of these projects, the shortage of housing, the
							dollar and piastre resources available to support these projects, et
							cetera. Still I believe we can work something out.</p>
                        <p>I fully understand the desire of your men in the field to enjoy familiar
							rations. That is the way it has always been with soldiers throughout
							history. Therefore, I have asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to work out with your officials a way to meet
							your request that the Korean forces be supplied with “kimchi.”<note n="3" xml:id="d112fn3">After studying the matter <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> approved a program
								whereby Korean soldiers in Vietnam would be provided kimchi and
								peppers once each day. The Department of Defense estimated the
								program would cost approximately $2 million per year. (Telegram

                        </p>
                        <p>We have already taken steps to meet your desire to have your forces in
							Viet Nam supplied with more modern equipment. A Korean-manned helicopter
							company will be operating in South Viet Nam by this summer. Distribution
							of the new rifle to your combat maneuver <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0272"/>elements has been authorized and will be completed
							within the next few months. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is looking into the other suggestions made to
							him by your Minister of Defense.</p>
                        <p>As you know, we have just returned from Guam. The primary purpose of the
							meeting was to permit our new diplomatic team to become acquainted with
							those whom they will succeed; for all of us to take stock of the
							situation, as we periodically do every six months or so; and thus to
							assure a smooth transition. We informed the Government of Viet Nam that
							we would be there and told them they would be welcome, if it were
							convenient, although we would understand if their current
							pre-occupations made it impossible for them to come. They chose to join
							us and used the occasion to accelerate the work in the Constituent
							Assembly and in the Directorate on the constitution. Prime Minister Ky
							was, therefore, able to present us with a copy of the new
							constitution.</p>
                        <p>All of us committed to the defense of South Viet Nam should, I believe,
							feel a real sense of satisfaction at the evolution of constitutional
							politics in South Viet Nam. I am told that the constitution reflects
							elements from the constitution of South Korea; and, even more important,
							I am sure the leadership in South Viet Nam is inspired by the success of
							South Korea in moving towards constitutional government since 1961.</p>
                        <p>It will be a very great achievement, indeed, if our friends in South Viet
							Nam can carry through successfully the election schedule of the next six
							months.</p>
                        <p>As you know, military operations are proceeding with steady success.
							There is much evidence of pressure on both the main forces and the
							guerrilla infrastructure. But none of us can state with confidence when
							the enemy effort will collapse.</p>
                        <p>We remain ready to respond to any effort that might lead to a peaceful
							resolution of the conflict which safeguards the independence and
							territorial integrity of South Viet Nam. We have wide support in Asia
							and elsewhere in what you and we and our allies are doing. Meanwhile, we
							must continue to maintain the pressure, and we may need to step it up
							with additional forces.</p>
                        <p>We will all have a chance to review these matters together and take stock
							at the meeting of the troop contributing countries in Washington, April
								20–21.<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">The conference, which was renamed

							mighty one, for which we are all grateful. You and I know what

								(Ibid.)</note> They would finance the foreign exchange costs in
							improvements of the country's electric power system. The total of the
							two loans is $34.7 million:</p>
                        <p>—$22 million to finance a new thermal power plant in southeast Korea, the
							nation's fastest-growing industrial area;</p>

                        <p>—$12.7 million for improvements in Korea's electric transmission
							[cl12]and distribution system.</p>
                        <p>You will recall that in May 1965, a commitment was made to President Park
							that we would provide Korea with $150 million in assistance this year.
							With the two proposed loans, we will have fulfilled that commitment up
							to $142 million. <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> is considering
							additional loans of $8 million and expects to fulfill the commitment to
							Park completely by this summer.</p>
                        <p>Under our urging, the Koreans have boosted electricity rates by 24 per
							cent. The new loans will carry the requirement for another 10 per cent
							raise. Other requirements are aimed at enabling the Korean power company
							to meet its own future needs for capital investment.</p>
                        <p>Korea's need for additional power resources is urgent if the country is
							to maintain its encouraging high rate of growth. Demand has increased 19
							per cent a year since 1964.</p>
                        <p>The loans would be used solely to finance purchase of United States
							equipment and services. Secretary Fowler agrees they will have a minimum
							adverse impact on our balance of payments. The Budget Bureau (Director
							Schultze) supports <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>'s proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">Reference is to an April 21 memorandum from

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>With the presidential election due to take place on Wednesday,<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">May 3.</note> I thought I would pass on to you some
							election eve thoughts about the presidential campaign, its significance
							and its meaning for the democratic process in Korea. Our forecasts and
							predictions about the outcome of the election you will have received in
							our daily reporting and you will know the results by the time you
							receive this letter.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">Analysis of the
								campaign and its results were transmitted in telegram 6166 from
								Seoul, May 16, and airgram A–546 from Seoul, May 31. (Both in

                        </p>
                        <p>I believe that time will show that political scientists will view the
							1967 campaign as a landmark in the developing political process of this
							country. It has not been an inspired or very exciting campaign. In fact
							in many ways it has been rather dull. This is part of its significance.
							It has been a struggle between the presidential candidates of two
							parties who by and large have gone before the people of the country, to
							state their case in terms of the issues of the day.</p>
                        <p>The campaign has been a policy contest, for the most part, with both
							sides stating their position, with each candidate strongly criticizing
							the views of his opponent, with people in a position to hear and
							evaluate the promises of the candidates. Pak has chosen to rest his case
							on his past performance and to seek a mandate to continue along these
							lines. His theme has been modernization of the country and the prestige
							and position of Korea. Yun on the other hand has argued that the Pak
							administration's economic policies have benefited only a few of the
							chosen and has proposed alternative economic policies which he claims
							will benefit the masses, particularly the farmers.</p>
                        <p>Another major theme of the opposition has been to call for a peaceful
							transfer of power to demonstrate to the world that Korea is a democracy.
							Salting all the opposition campaign speeches have been the traditional
							charges of corruption, military dictatorial rule, police and
							intelligence agency politics, privileged power and sell-out to
							foreigners diplomacy.</p>
                        <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0277"/>
                        <p>The campaign was hardly under way when the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> was loudly voicing its charges of illegal campaigning
							by the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> lost no time in responding in kind. To
							its charges, the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> soon added its fear
							and concerns that election rigging and other illegal election activity
							would occur. These fears and concerns were rapidly replaced with more
							positive statements that they knew of <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>/Pak administration plans to engage in such nefarious
							deeds.</p>
                        <p>During the campaign <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun Po-sun</persName>, Yu
							Chin-o and others of the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> went at
							their tasks in a most strenuous manner with the aged <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> and other <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> stumping teams covering the countryside and the cities
							in a highly effective manner. Considering the newness of their
							organization and their comparatively limited funds, the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> conducted quite an intensive campaign.
							The crowds they gathered, particularly in the cities, were of
							respectable size and reflected the deep election interest of the people,
							though most observers reported the crowds as being relatively quiet and
							unresponsive.</p>
                        <p>The opposition coalition was not as solid as it looked. A number of old
							respected figures stayed out of the campaign or made only a perfunctory
							effort on behalf of Yun. George Paek took a trip to Geneva and was away
							during most of the campaign. Madam Pak entered the fray in the closing
							days and made only a few speeches. Others such as Yi Pom-sok and Yu
							Chin-san could never be accused of undue exertion on behalf of <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>. Nevertheless the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> kept its cohesion and campaigned
							without any overt rifts.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> followed a different strategy in
							its campaigning, a strategy in part shaped by their analysis of American
							election campaigns. The brunt of the battle in the first half of the
							campaign was carried by <gloss target="#t_KCP1">KCP</gloss> aided by
							selected party faithful. Their efforts were mainly concentrated in the
							rural areas and the small towns where the significance of the size of
							the crowds they drew is hard to determine.</p>
                        <p>The big gun was unlimbered in the last two weeks of the campaign when
							President Pak officially began his electioneering. (Prior to then his
							public appearances were claimed to be part of his normal ceremonial
							duties as President, though I suspect Pak's rate of ribbon cutting hit
							an all-time weekly high over the past months.) Pak concentrated his
							efforts in the urban areas and, even by conservative estimates, he
							attracted (or the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> arranged for)
							rather massive attendance. He clearly outdrew <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> whenever the two spoke in the same city. The
							opposition, of course, claimed that Pak's huge crowds were mobilized by
							illegal activities of the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> and
							Government, and this belief is probably shared by most Koreans.</p>
                        <p>There is ample evidence that the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							machine with its substantial resources did help considerably to increase
							the crowd sizes, but the predisposition to attend, sheer curiosity about
							or interest in the President <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0278"/>was probably present in the first instance. The <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> crowds were generally cheerful and well
							behaved, and showed little overt evidence of regimentation. There is no
							evidence that coercive measures were used to create crowds for Pak. In
							addressing his audience, Pak had no better luck than <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> in developing any responsiveness or
							a real fervor for the cause. Many observers attribute this to his style
							and to his speeches which were coldly logical, factual and full of dull
							statistics.</p>
                        <p>Both parties and the press have paid tremendous attention—perhaps too
							much—to the size of the crowd a stumping team would gather. The size of
							the gatherings was used by both sides as a barometer for election
							success and a sign of public support. Because of this, the charges and
							countercharges relating to efforts to mobilize attendance at rallies
							have been numerous and vehement. Both sides, needless to say, have been
							guilty with the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> excesses
							outnumbering the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> efforts. This is
							not because the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> by nature is purer
							in soul than the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>, but is simply a
							reflection of the fact that <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							organizational capabilities, funds and other resources were far greater
							than those of the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>. Nevertheless in
							the public exchange, the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> probably
							did succeed in leaving the impression with most Korean voters that the
								<gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> used illegal means to gather
							huge crowds to its rallies.</p>
                        <p>The press had great fun and games in estimating crowd sizes, as did the
							parties. The formulas used by various reporters and other estimators
							became the subject of considerable examination and discussion. The
							officials of both parties believed press figures consistently
							underestimated their rally gatherings and the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> charged that the Government forced the papers to
							underestimate their crowd size. Most impartial observers felt both sides
							overestimated the numbers at the rallies, as did the police and
								[K]<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in their reporting.
							Nevertheless the general feeling is that the crowds exceeded those of
							1963 and that Pak did outdraw <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>
							in the urban areas where they both spoke. Pak's margin, however, cannot
							be accounted for solely on the basis of superior <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> legal and illegal efforts at crowd gathering.</p>
                        <p>The role of the splinter parties in the campaign was interesting, in that
							it simply was not a factor. None of the five made any serious effort to
							campaign and when they did they drew little public attention. Only
							random mention was made of their activities in the press and the general
							impression was that they would have little effect on the outcome. The
							withdrawal of So Min-ho, the candidate of one of the more significant
							splinter parties, from the presidential race is, of course, a good
							indication of the little influence the splinter parties expect to have
							on the outcome. So's withdrawal probably will add votes to <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>'s total and he doubtlessly was able
							to extract a price for his action.</p>
                        <p>It is interesting to note how with the passage of time the number of
							splinter parties involved in Korean elections have decreased. While <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0279"/>a few of these parties revolve
							around particular individuals who expound a specific political
							philosophy, most of them are organized around political opportunists.
							These latter groups are centered around individuals who have usually
							been frustrated in their efforts to gain position and prominence in one
							or the other of the major parties. They then organize a splinter party
							because they see an opportunity for personal financial gain by securing
							political funds from one of the major parties who provide the funds in
							the belief that divide and conquer is a good tactic, or because they
							feel that there is a chance for political blackmail, at a crucial time a
							deal can be made with a major party to give the splinter group a piece
							of the political trade.</p>
                        <p>The first group of splinter parties will no doubt continue to be present
							in the Korean political scene permanently, just as we have our
							Prohibition Party and others. The second group is beginning to disappear
							from the scene as the political party system has matured and become more
							institutionalized, a process which I feel is well under way and is being
							given a strong push by this Presidential election. This process is being
							helped along by time as well, as it takes its toll of the various aged
							political personalities who have dominated the political scene in this
							country since 1948 and who gathered followers on the basis of personal
							allegiances rather than fellow political believers.</p>
                        <p>Another interesting aspect of the campaign has been the role of the press
							and government influence over it. The <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> has been most outspoken on this point and, as always,
							where there is smoke there is some fire. Rather foolishly, the
							government through the [K]<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> did seek
							to intensify its influence on the press. This is not new, for even in
							non-election time the [K]<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has special
							teams that cover the newspaper offices leaving word what to print and
							what not to print. The tempo, however, has been stepped up in the sense
							that [K]<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> agents make their visits
							more often and for longer periods of time.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, setting aside the several outspokenly pro-government and
							pro-opposition papers, the press treatment of <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> activities was
							balanced, arithmetically so well balanced in terms of inches of news
							space as to make some of us feel that the press had been instructed to
							hit this balance. Our reading of the press did not lead us to conclude
							that there was any real substance to the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> charges. Certainly the press coverage we have observed
							does not justify the appellation of “controlled press” being applied
							here. In many ways, it was a mature and responsible coverage. Possibly
							the fact that the press did not automatically side with the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>, picking up and expanding on its many
							unsubstantial accusations, so frustrated and disappointed the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> that they could only conclude the
							government was controlling and suppressing the press. The <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> and the Government supporters did many
							things such as buying up advertising space, more favorable <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0280"/>placing of stories about the Pak and
							the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> on the front page and other
							foolish stunts, that warrant a charge of “dirty pool” but hardly can be
							considered to involve an effort to suborn the freedom of expression. At
							any rate it is hard to see this type of political gimmickry really
							affecting voter attitudes.</p>
                        <p>The press played an unusual role in the early part of the campaign that
							had far reaching effect. Both parties had started off on a tactic of
							heavy personal abuse of the opposition candidate. The audiences and the
							press reacted negatively, with the press particularly criticizing both
							parties for resorting to the personal abuse theme and strongly urging
							that campaign speakers stick to the issues. Thereafter personal attacks
							diminished considerably and substantive issues were the heart of most
							speeches.</p>
                        <p>The press did give its readers in roughly equal proportion the basic
							facts on what the candidates were saying. It did not grossly or
							irresponsibly distort the arguments or claims of either side. It did
							give the readers the papers criticism and commentary on the issues and
							the pledges of the candidates. The restrictions and inhibitions on the
							press caused by the Government were in large measure foolish,
							consequently damaging to its cause, and reminiscent of an era which the
							country has outgrown but is simply experiencing a cultural lag.</p>
                        <p>The major campaign issues were those relating to the economy. Domestic
							political issues of corruption, maladministration, civil service wage
							scales, length of military service were not lively ones and such foreign
							policy subjects as the Vietnam troop dispatch or the Japanese
							normalization treaty in terms of public interest hardly qualified as
							election issues.</p>
                        <p>Both sides presented their views on the economic issues extensively.
							There were not only speeches but numerous newspaper articles, radio and
							TV programs where <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> spokesmen were provided an opportunity
							to present their case on a particular subject. An interested voter had
							available to him many ways to determine party views on specific issues
							of interest to him.</p>
                        <p>Agricultural policy was probably the most important substantive issue and
							very likely the most significant when it came to swaying votes.
								<persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> went at this issue heavily, playing to
							the predominant rural voter and promising him high rice prices and low
							fertilizer costs. The “rich get richer and the poor get poorer” theme
							was for the farmers' benefit. Contrasts were drawn between the plight of
							the farmer and the gains of the urban population. To this was added the
							promise of lower taxes and the dangers of continuing present government
							policies which were bringing higher prices and saddling the nation with
							foreign loans that would keep the nation in debt to foreigners for many
							years to come.</p>
                        <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0281"/>
                        <p>Pak and the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> sought to counter these
							arguments by pointing to the progress of the past, promising a faster
							rate of economic progress in the future and logically analyzing the
							opposition claims and promises to demonstrate their lack of realism,
							irrationality and weakness. They sought to make their case on the need
							for a balanced development between agriculture and industry—a rather
							sophisticated economic argument to make stick in a country with a
							predominantly rural/farming voting population. The <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> is worried about the psychological
							effect on the rural voters of the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>
							campaign promises.</p>
                        <p>The other issues in the campaign are not likely to have much effect on
							the voter. Corruption as an issue has become standard in Korean
							electioneering and does not seem to have had any impact on the voters.
							To be meaningful it needed a hot, specific scandal at this time to stir
							up emotions. The Samsong scandal was six months too soon. Furthermore
							Pak admitted the existence of some corruption in his administration and
							promised to continue his efforts to eradicate it if elected. Lastly, the
							Korean voter has always lived with corruption and only gets excited
							about it if it exceeds the bounds of his standards of propriety. This
							has not been the case.</p>
                        <p>Probably one of the most fascinating features of the past weeks has been
							that of the charges and countercharges of illegal activities. First, let
							me say that under Korean election laws, it is virtually impossible to
							run a modern election campaign without violating the law. The detailed
							restrictions and limitations that were enacted after the military
							revolution to control political election activity border on the absurd.
							Campaign activities which are proscribed by the election laws were
							engaged in by both sides, but at home we would consider most of such
							activities as part of practicing the “art of politics” and not illegal.
							Many of the violations were undoubtedly committed in sheer ignorance of
							the administrative red tape involved. At the same time there was no
							doubt considerable deliberate violation for the simple reason that
							present legal restrictions severely handicap modern day campaigning.</p>
                        <p>In spite of <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> charges, Pak has
							consistently called for honest and fair elections. Where there have been
							transgressions so far, we do not see these as deliberate, planned
							efforts by Pak or the senior <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							hierarchy. Most of them stem from overzealous subordinates and local
							officials. There is no evidence to show that there was any massive
							interference by the police or the government machinery during the
							campaign. Local incidents did, of course, occur and were duly reported
							by us. These, however, were not of sufficient magnitude or frequency to
							appear to have any significant impact on the electoral process.</p>
                        <p>As of election eve, we have no evidence to support charges of
							election-rigging, ballot box stuffing, etc. There will be some
							hanky-panky in some of the voting districts without question but then I
							doubt <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0282"/>if there has ever been a
							free election anyplace in the world that did not involve some of them.
							The sound and fury here of illegal activities and election rigging far
							exceeds the realities of the situation. Such tactics are part of the
							Korean political scene because it has been true in the past; it prepares
							the ground and provides the alibi for the loser; it also places the
							loser in a good position to call for a recount if the margin of victory
							is narrow. From what we have seen and heard from impartial observers,
							this will be as honest and fair an election as you will find at home or
							in Britain or any other generally accepted politically mature
							democracy.</p>
                        <p>If our forecast is right, the final results should show Pak as the
							winner. This is based on our soundings, which show that most Koreans
							feel that Pak has made a reasonably successful effort to modernize the
							country and to improve the lot of the people as a whole. It is also
							based on the recognition that the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							organization can effectively deliver the vote. If <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> should win, it will be not because
							the people have faith in him, in his leadership or in his policies. It
							will be, rather, a vote of protest against Pak. We have seen no signs of
							an “opposition boom” and it would surprise everyone if a protest vote
							carried <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> into the Blue
							House.</p>
                        <p>There is a question, however, that many people are asking themselves—what
							will happen if by some chance <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>
							should win; will Pak turn over the government? Our reaction is that he
							would and would ask the people to rally behind the new government. This
							would not be the end, however. We suspect that the military would accept
							this change but watch it very closely. If <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> could not maintain political stability in the
							country, continue the pace of economic growth and development, and
							preserve Korea's international position and prestige, we believe they
							would move against him. The military would give <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> at least a six month trial period
							but we doubt whether they would permit him to stay in power if his
							administration started to lose the gains achieved since the 1961
							military revolution.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned in the beginning, I see this election and its campaign as
							being most significant. It has been more a confrontation of policy
							issues and public pledges between two major political parties than a
							battle between personalities seeking to attract adherents by virtue of
							personal magnetism and charisma. The audiences at rallies were quiet,
							but their magnitude evidenced a high level of interest in the election.
							The strong adverse reaction to the early phases of the campaign, when
							speeches were peppered with personal abuse of the opposing candidate and
							his functionaries, revealed the seriousness with which the voter
							approached his civic responsibility. Both sides promptly turned to
							stuffing the voter with their views on substantive issues and they paid
							close attention to voter reaction.</p>
                        <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0283"/>
                        <p>The debates over issues affected party strategy as the campaign moved
							along. <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>'s and <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> efforts to stir up the people in terms
							of their dissatisfaction with the circumstances in which they lived had
							its effect. In the closing days the sensitivities of the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> to the possible inroads being made by
							the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> on the farmers sent the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> stumping teams scurrying into the
							countryside, particularly in the Chollas. Pak, in the meantime,
							continued his efforts in the cities in an effort to capture the urban
							areas which were his weakness in 1963.</p>
                        <p>The campaign and the elections are significant in another sense for they
							involved as candidates the leaders of two different political
							generations. In <persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName>, we had the
							type of political figure who dominated Korean politics from 1948 to
							1961—the individual who gathered followers on a personal but very fluid
							basis; who spent most of his life fighting against the institution of
							government, which was an alien power; whose life was mostly shaped by
							traditional and ancient Korean thought, values and mores, with little
							exposure to the outside world and its ways.</p>
                        <p>In Pak, we have the prototype of the new political figure in Korea. He is
							an organization man, not an individual; a manager of a political party,
							not a leader of a personal cult. He spent his mature life (his 30's and
							40's) in a free Korea and not under an alien regime. He has been heavily
							exposed to the ways and ideas of the outside world. He has seen and
							experienced the implications of modern science and technology and has
							recognized that these must be appropriately introduced into Korean life
							if Korea is to survive.</p>
                        <p>We have, in brief, in this election a conflict of generations. If
								<persName corresp="#p_YP1">Yun</persName> loses, as we believe he
							will, it will mean the demise of that generation politically. This
							demise will have its greatest meaning for the opposition. Will the
							current opposition coalition shatter into numerous pieces or will it
							stay substantially together with only chipping away of bits and pieces?
							We are inclined to think that the latter will be the case. The
							opposition will keep itself largely intact with small groups breaking
							off to start their own party. There are too many younger men in the
							opposition today who can see a successful political future for
							themselves only if they remain united. They have not yet been possessed
							by the type of egotism, vanity and self-assurance that make them feel
							that the party needs them more than they need the party.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">To summarize</hi>: the campaign itself was heavily
							spotted with illegal practices by both sides. But what was involved were
							minor actions designed to lure, entice and convince the voter to support
							a particular candidate, which violated an impractically strict election
							law. There was no evidence of efforts to manipulate the actual vote or
							impair or frustrate the individual's right of free choice in the polling
							booth. The atmosphere of military government which prevailed in 1963 was
							gone. Freedom of political discussion was prevalent. There were no
							concerns <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0284"/>about the police,
								[K]<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> or military would haul off to
							jail anyone who talked against Pak. The people took the election and its
							issues seriously though unemotionally. Violence and extremism were
							notable by their absence. The 1967 campaign was a mature and responsible
							one; the Korean people and its emerging party system can be proud of
							it.</p>
                        <p>It will be interesting to see whether tomorrow and time bear out these
							thoughts.</p>

                        <p>6635. For Secretary and <persName>Bundy</persName> from Ambassador.
							Subject: Tactics and Considerations on Any New Request for Further
							Troops for Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. Before leaving this post,<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> left Seoul June 10; he
								was replaced by <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">William J.
									Porter</persName>.</note> I would like to give you my thoughts
							in the event we decide to ask for a further contribution of Korean
							forces to South Vietnam in the near future.</p>
                        <p>2. If we plan to make such a request, the manner in which the question is
							raised with President Pak will be of primary importance.</p>
                        <p>3. I would recommend that we do not confront him with a formal request
							for more forces as the first step. Rather, we should go to the President
							and tell him that we wish to consult with him about a common problem. We
							should explain to him in detail our estimate of the situation in South
							Vietnam, the strategy which we propose to follow in the long and short
							term, how we would propose to carry it out, what forces we <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0285"/>think would be necessary to do so, what
							we are planning to do ourselves. Recalling that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and he both agreed that it
							would be in the interests of both of them to bring the affair to some
							sort of satisfactory conclusion at the earliest possible date, we should
							then ask him whether and to what extent Korea would be able to
							assist.</p>
                        <p>4. This would avoid confronting him with a formal request, to which he
							would have to answer yes or no. He is probably expecting a direct
							request. Having the matter presented to him in the form of consultation
							about a common problem with a view to planning common action would
							provide him greater room for maneuver in handling his domestic problems
							and would be greatly appreciated. It would enable him, if he felt that
							he could respond in some degree, to do so in the form of a voluntary,
							self initiated offer of cooperation. It would make clear our
							understanding of and consideration for the problems which he personally
							will face, and I think would be the approach best calculated to put him
							in a responsive frame of mind.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> instructed the Vice President to follow
									<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s suggested
								approach during his talks with Pak when attending the President's
								inauguration in Seoul. (Telegram 217692, TOVIP 2, to Seoul, June 28;
								National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Humphrey discussed the matter with Pak
								during a meeting on June 30 and broached the subject again during a
								farewell call on July 3. (Telegram 23 from Seoul, July 1; ibid.,

								72 from Seoul, July 5; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
								27–3 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. President Pak's personal attitude is, of course, the most crucial
							single factor in the whole situation.</p>
                        <p>6. Secondly, I have already made it clear that we will have to be
							prepared to pay a substantial price for a further contribution. I would
							recommend that we be generously forthcoming at the outset and not adopt
							a bargaining approach. This also will contribute to the proper frame of
							mind on the Korean side and will help President Pak in his problems with
							the Assembly and the public. Regrettably, many Koreans, including high
							officials, do not feel that we have yet adequately fulfilled our
							commitments for the last troop dispatch and consider our attitude as
							being far from generous or understanding. The price that we should be
							ready to offer should include something very dramatic, even though this
							might not be strictly appropriate or necessary for military or economic
							reasons. But something of this kind, calculated to appeal to Korean
							pride, to reflect a noticeable gain or advantage to the nation, and to
							provide a reassurance to Korean public opinion, would be a real and
							perhaps necessary element for an affirmative response.</p>
                        <p>7. Lastly, I must reiterate that securing a further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop contribution will be difficult
							under the best of circumstances and that success is by no means a
							certainty. If we are seriously contemplating such a <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254" facs="0286"/>move we should now be preparing the
							ground against that time by doing the relatively small things that
							benefit the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, reflecting our
							generosity and understanding toward a steadfast friend and ally. Our
							current attitudes and positions on a number of items under discussion
							between ourselves and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, e.g.,
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilian participation in the
							Vietnam pacification program, troop strength levels, the Korean combat
							ration, and procurement in Korea, while quite justified if taken in
							isolation, are not helping to create a frame of mind that would make
							them respond instinctively in a cooperative and friendly manner.</p>
                        <p>8. In all this, we must bear in mind that, in response to opposition
							charges during current election campaign, President Pak has consistently
							maintained that his government has no intention of sending additional
							troops to Vietnam. If additional troops are to be sent, he would have a
							very real practical problem in obtaining the required authorizing
							legislation from the Assembly. The Assembly and the public would have to
							be persuaded that circumstances make it necessary for the President to
							do what he has publicly said he has no intention of doing and that this
							will be to the clear advantage of Korea. The President himself must be
							given solid grounds for believing that he can accede to our request
							without seriously damaging his own political position.</p>

                        <p>On June 8, 1967, Koreans voted to elect 175 members of the National
							Assembly. Although several splinter parties participated in the
							campaign, the contest focused on candidates from the two major parties,
							the Democratic Republican Party and the New Democratic Party. When the
							results were tallied, the Democratic Republican Party won a majority of
							130 seats, while 44 seats went to the opposition New Democratic Party.
							The Masses' Party, the sole successful splinter party, won a single
							seat.</p>
                        <p>Since the Democratic Republican Party's margin of victory, giving it
							better than a two-thirds majority in the Assembly, was unexpectedly
							large, the opposition New Democratic Party charged that the Democratic
							Republican victory had resulted from illegalities and fraud. The charges
							of corruption spurred student unrest and demonstrations, which
							intensified post-election dissatisfaction. Opposition party leaders
							sought to nullify the election results by demanding a new election, <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0287"/>and newly elected opposition
							members refused to take their seats at the start of the Assembly session
							on July 1. Those circumstances produced a serious political crisis.</p>
                        <p>Both parties acknowledged election irregularities, but the Democratic
							Republican Party and President Pak denied the opposition's charges that
							the election had been manipulated from Seoul. The Embassy also reported
							that irregularities, in fact, stemmed from lack of central control,
							allowing local candidates and local officials willingly to engage in or
							encourage malpractices and to ignore election rules. Post-election
							investigations identified persons who had engaged in such practices,
							leading the Democratic Republican Party to expel nine of its newly
							elected Assembly members from the party immediately after the election
							and an additional eight members in September and October.</p>
                        <p>Fearful that the Democratic Republican Party would use its majority to
							change the Constitution, thereby enabling President Pak to serve a third
							Presidential term, and concerned about future election prospects,
							opposition party leader Yu Chin-o demanded that 1) President Pak
							publicly apologize for rigging the election, 2) the election results be
							nullified and a new election held, 3) those responsible for the
							irregularities be punished, and 4) guarantees be instituted to prevent
							future election irregularities. Largely because of disarray within the
							New Democratic Party and because of conciliatory moves made by the
							Democratic Republican Party, both sides negotiated to end the impasse,
							which officially ended on November 29 when all but two elected Assembly
							members took their seats. (Airgram A–33 from Seoul, July 20; National

                        <p>Korea Mr. Colby reported that in response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>'s request, his people had
							reviewed North Korean infiltrations of South Korea and had come to the
							conclusion that their purpose was the establishment of cells which might
							eventually be used not only for the collection of intelligence but for
							the support of guerilla warfare. He cited interrogations of the few
							agents who have been captured and said that his analysts had concluded
							that large numbers of North Vietnamese were in training for eventual
							infiltration. There was considerable speculation among members of the
							staff both at Headquarters and in the field that the North Koreans were
							taking a page from the North Vietnamese book and planned to establish a
							base for eventual warfare in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> questioned Mr. Colby
							closely as to whether there were indications that the objective of the
							North Korean infiltrations might be assassination of South Korean
							leaders. Mr. Colby's reply indicated that he believed any attempts at
							assassination would depend largely on opportunity and that he felt that
							this was not a major objective.</p>

                        <p rend="center">SECURITY CONDITIONS IN SOUTH KOREA</p>
                        <p>1. The risks involved in Vice President Humphrey's visit to the Seoul
							area and his attendance at the 1 July inauguration of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> President Pak are twofold. Pak's
							domestic political opponents may use the occasion to demonstrate against
							his regime, creating a situation in which the safety of the Vice
							President might be jeopardized. More serious, it is possible that North
							Korean Communist agents will carry out violent attacks on Pak, members
							of his government, or on Vice President Humphrey himself.</p>
                        <p>2. Domestic Political Opponents. South Korea is presently experiencing
							considerable political tension. Members of the leading opposition party
							and anti-regime student elements have been angrily protesting alleged
							rigging of the 8 June legislative elections by the Pak government and
							its party machinery. The government has conceded that illegal
							tactics—vote buying, open balloting, ballot-box stuffing, police
							pressures, and the like—were used in certain districts and has moved to
							right a few of these wrongs. But it has refused to consider opposition
							demands for new elections nationwide. A compromise of sorts, perhaps
							involving the resignation of a few high administration officials, seems
							likely. But it is also probable that before the dust is permitted to
							settle, some opposition elements will mount additional public protests
							and carry out plans for obstructing legislative business, including a
							boycott of the inaugural ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>3. Anti-regime protests by students, in Seoul and elsewhere, reached a
							peak of intensity last week, but have been terminated as a result of
							firm police action and the suspension of college classes by the
							government. If classes resume, however, additional student street
							demonstrations may take place.</p>
                        <p>4. In sum, there is a possibility that Vice President Humphrey's visit
							will be marred by public protests of some sort against the Pak regime.
							It seems unlikely, however, that any demonstrations or other antics by
							the political opposition and its student allies would be carried out so
							as deliberately to embarrass or endanger the Vice President. <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0290"/>There has been no hint that opposition
							leaders hold the US in any way responsible for the alleged election
							frauds. Moreover, in recent years, South Koreans have evidenced an
							unwillingness to wash dirty linen in front of foreign dignitaries; on
							the contrary, domestic factions have tended to submerge differences on
							occasions of international significance in the interest of preserving
							national prestige.</p>
                        <p>5. In any case, we believe that South Korean security forces available in
							the Seoul area would be capable of controlling any demonstration by
							anti-regime elements. The National Police, who will have the main
							responsibility for the safety of the foreign guests, are tough and
							experienced in crowd control. So are the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army contingents permanently assigned to internal
							security duties in the Seoul area. Intelligence organizations—the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army CIC—are efficient and cooperative with their US
							counterparts. They will probably round up known troublemakers and issue
							stern warnings in appropriate political and student circles.</p>
                        <p>6. North Korean Communist Agents. In October 1966, on the occasion of
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s trip to South
							Korea, we were able to dismiss the danger of violence by North Korean
							Communist agents with the notation that “their missions have not
							involved deliberate violence but rather intelligence collection and
							recruitment.” (SNIE 40/50–66, para. 11)<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">
								SNIE 40/50–66, October 13. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_EAP1">EAP</gloss>
								Files: Lot 90 D 110, SNIE 40/50–66)</note> Since that time, the
							situation has changed markedly. For various reasons, some related to
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> participation in the Vietnam
							War, Pyong-yang has stepped up its infiltration of agents southward, and
							more important, it has initiated a campaign of sporadic violence against
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> area. North Korean agents are also
							attempting sabotage missions for the first time since the Korean
								Armistice.<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3">One such effort, on 22 May
								just south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, resulted in
								the destruction of two US infantry barracks with the loss of two men
								killed and nineteen wounded. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
							And the North Koreans have begun to infiltrate small teams of
							highly-trained agents to scout for likely guerrilla base areas in remote
							rural regions.<note n="4" xml:id="d120fn4">Three such groups have been
								discovered by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security forces.
								Attempts to run them down have resulted in the deaths of thirteen
									<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s and eight North Koreans; at
								least 29 North Koreans remain at large. [Footnote in the source
								text.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. It is apparent, therefore, that North Korea is no longer disposed to
							refrain from acts of violence in the South; indeed, Pyongyang has
							evidently decided to accept the risks involved in shedding a limited
							amount of South Korean and US blood. Would Pyongyang take the added risk
							involved in any attempt to assassinate leaders of South Korea and the
							US? We are aware of several North Korean direct threats <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0291"/>against the life of President Pak and
							the dispatch of occasional agent teams charged with this mission. The
							possibility of another Communist effort of this sort during the
							inaugural period cannot be dismissed. The political gains for the North
							could be considerable; Pak provides the only real cement for whatever
							degree of political stability exists in South Korea. An attempt on Pak,
							of course, would endanger those notables, including the Vice President,
							in his vicinity.</p>
                        <p>8. It seems unlikely, however, that the Communists would focus an
							assassination effort on Mr. Humphrey. The political justification from
							the North Korean viewpoint would be much less compelling than that for
							an attack on Pak.</p>
                        <p>9. We cannot, of course, exclude the possibility of an assassination
							attempt by some Communist or other radical acting on his own or an
							attempt by a psychopath.</p>

							Vietnam. President Pak expressed his support for U.S. policy in <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0292"/>Vietnam, stating that in his
							view the conflict could be resolved by: “1) continuing military pressure
							on the enemy; 2) careful support of the process of building
							constitutional government and of the pacification program; 3) opening of
							all avenues of discussion and dialog toward a possible peace settlement
							in Vietnam.” (Telegram 7076 from Seoul, June 30; National Archives and
							Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/HUMPHREY)</p>
                        <p>In addition to attending the inauguration ceremonies on July 1, Vice
							President Humphrey met with Prime Minister Sato for a wide-ranging
							discussion of the Glassboro summit, the Middle East, and economic
							issues. (Telegram 24 from Seoul, July 2; ibid.) He also met with members
							of the South Vietnamese delegation. The primary focus of their
							discussion was the political situation and upcoming elections in South
							Vietnam. (Telegram 20 from Seoul, July 1; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>The only untoward incident occurring during the inaugural program
							involved members of the New Democratic Party broadcasting over
							loudspeakers in close proximity to inauguration ceremonies. The Embassy
							reported that President Pak “was personally insulted and nation
							humiliated in front of foreign dignitaries by conduct of <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>.” (Telegram 280 from Seoul, July 17;
							ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) An ill-conceived remark about the incident was
							erroneously attributed to Vice President Humphrey and widely reported by
							the media in Korea and in the United States, causing him personal
							embarrassment and distress. (Telegrams 61 and 69 from Seoul, both July
							5, telegram 98 from Seoul, July 6, and letter from Humphrey to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, July 15, among others; all ibid.,
								<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/HUMPHREY)</p>
                        <p>On July 2 Vice President Humphrey met with President Pak and Prime
							Minister <persName>Chung</persName>, as well as Vice President Yen of
							the Republic of China and Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> of Japan. The 1 1/2 hour meeting, labeled by the
							media as the “Little Summit,” focused on concerns about Communist China
							and its emergence as a nuclear power. (Telegram 29 from Seoul, July 2;
							ibid.) The following day, July 3, the Vice President met with Vice
							President Yen for a discussion of regional issues, including Vietnam.
							(Telegram 48 from Seoul, July 4; ibid.) Humphrey also paid a farewell
							visit to President Pak. They reviewed comments made at the Little Summit
							and matters pertaining to Vietnam, particularly the upcoming elections,
							the pacification program, and security matters. (Telegram 47 from Seoul,
							July 4; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>Vice President Humphrey submitted on July 6 a detailed report to
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussing his trip to
							Korea. The report summarized his discussions in Seoul, recorded his
							impressions of the Asian leaders with whom he met, outlined the relevant
							issues important to each Asian leader, and contained policy
							recommendations. On Korea, the Vice President recommended giving high
							priority <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0293"/>to Korean requests for
							security and communications equipment to assist in the fight against
							North Korean infiltration, granting generous technical and economic
							assistance in case Korea decided to furnish additional troops for
							Vietnam, continuing support for the Korean Institute of Science and
							Technology as well as for educational exchange programs between the
							United States and South Korea, and using “United States leverage and
							assistance in the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> field” to foster the
							continued development of constitutional democracy in the Republic of
							Korea. (Memorandum from Humphrey to the President, July 6; <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library, National Security
							File, Name File, Vice President, Vol. II) The Vice President received a
							detailed commentary on the points raised in his report from Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in which <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that the Vice President's
							recommended actions relative to Korea were already being implemented or

                            <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Sam Berger</persName> was not inclined to

                        <p>This seems to fit the picture of heightened tension all around Communist

							heightened tensions by acting concomitantly. In doing so, they can
							indicate support for their Vietnamese ideological brothers, at least be
							in line with China in its anti-American policy, and not be irritating
							their Soviet friends in the process. They would seem to be out to cause
							maximum trouble short of precipitating any real confrontation with
							us.</p>

                        <p>Korea, July 21, 1967, 1207Z.</p>
                        <p>KRA 1579. Following message passed to you for your info per <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>. Subject: Situation in Korea as of
							mid-July 1967.</p>
                        <p>1. Events here since my last summary in my KRA 1374 dated 25 June
								1967<note n="4" xml:id="d123fn4">Not found.</note> have continued at
							a somewhat intensified pace.</p>
                        <p>2. Internal political affairs are well covered by current Embassy cables.
							There appears to be little hope for <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss>
							compromise with opposition and internal scars of June 8 elections are by
							no means healed.</p>
                        <p>3. In regard to North Korean actions, it becomes clearer as time moves on
							that a significant effort is underway to try to apply subversive war
							against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. An interesting facet of this derives from review and analysis of
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> statements at Panmunjom and the
							parallel <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> propaganda line pushed out
							increasingly since last autumn for Pyongyang, Moscow and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> embassies world wide. The theme has two
							parts. First is that <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0295"/>the
							imperialistic Yankees and their <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							puppets are trying to reopen the Korean War to take pressure off Vietnam
							and are flagrantly violating the armistice to provoke such an event—and
							the North Koreans are prepared for such a war so that if it occurs they
							will annihilate us. (Of note in this regard is that interrogations of
							recently captured agents reiterate <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							view I reported in my KRA 1795 of 10 Nov 66<note n="5" xml:id="d123fn5">
                                <ref target="#d99">Document 99</ref>.</note> that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>'s evaluate US as so overextended in
							support Vietnam that we would be unable adequately to reinforce Korea in
							case of war.) The second part of propaganda theme is constant repetition
							of the big lie to the effect that none of the aggressive actions along
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or in interior of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> are result of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> activity. On contrary they reiterate monotonously that
							this is all due to South Koreans who are fighting to throw off Yankee
							yoke; i.e., it is an indigenous, Korea-style “Vietcong” activity.
							Absurdity of this in light repeated proof that all actions are by North
							Korean agent/guerrillas does not faze them.</p>
                        <p>5. I consider this propaganda line the tip-off to the growing seriousness
							of North Korean intentions and capabilities. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s seem seriously embarked on a large scale effort to try
							to develop a subversive war in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and I
							think it now timely for us to conscientiously review the bidding on
							policies re North Korea, on how and what US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s should be prepared to do if <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s escalate their subversive activities, and on priorities
							re <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> assistance to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
							North Koreans are arrogantly disavowing their flagrant and large scale
							violations of the armistice in what seems to be an effort to build
							acceptance by world public opinion for their intensification of hostile
							subversive acts with little or no risk to them for their de facto
							abrogation of the armistice. They are, in other words, carefully trying
							to make the US and rest of world accustomed as a matter of course to
							steadily increasing hostile action against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> at no great risk to North Korea, in same way that in
							Vietnam the Geneva Accords and Vietnam <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> were eroded and bypassed by Communists in effort to
							delay timely and effective free world reaction and confuse the real
							issues. All this jibes with speeches and directives by Kim Il-sung from
							his March 65 requirement for more effective espionage activities against
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, in context of how Mao's Chinese
							Communists had “liberated” China by guerrilla action and how guerrillas
							in Vietnam were “successfully” carrying out their mission, through to
							his policy address of 5 October 1966, when he stressed the need for
							expanding preparations for war and adopting more aggressive tactics in
								anti-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> operations to achieve
							earlier unification of the “fatherland.”<note n="6" xml:id="d123fn6">A
								discussion of the points made by Kim Il-sung in his October 1966
								address is in Intelligence Note No. 94, February 2, 1968. (National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69,
									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 32–4 KOR)</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>6. Intelligence indicates <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s have now
							trained in special unit schools and have available for dispatch some
							1200 or more specially selected agent-guerrilla personnel. Some
							instructors have been in Vietnam. All are capable of conducting
							subversion, espionage, agitation, and supporting or carrying out
							militant guerrilla action. More are currently in training. In addition
							they have been carefully training for two years 500 subversives in each
							of the nine <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provinces for guerrilla
							activity in a target <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> province
							assigned to each of the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provinces.
							This adds up to 5,000 or more specially trained thugs. We must also take
							into account their 4,070-man reconnaissance brigade, a
							special-forces-type unit capable of being employed in guerrilla
							operations. Thus total available for future <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> subversive utilization adds up to about 10,000.</p>
                        <p>7. Current para-guerrilla action in interior of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is now clearly confirmed to be test of ability to
							operate in current <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> environment and
							reconnaissance to support later large-scale real guerrilla action. We
							call current activity “para-guerrilla” because so far sabotage and
							widespread terrorism has not been practiced. One interrogated captive
							has said [garble—current] plan is to start active phase of sabotage,
							blowing up railroads, bridges and buildings, terrorism, etc., next year
							but perhaps later this year if conditions permit. Another has said they
							may put in up to 400 agents this year. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s appear at this time to be able to land para-guerrilla teams
							from their fast boats almost at will. [<hi rend="italic">5–1/2 lines of
								source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>8. Detected para-guerrilla activity has now developed in three areas:
							Taebaek-san, West Chiri-san, and west of Ulsan. Every day there are
							sightings, contacts and firefights. Box score since 1 January from
							actions in interior of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, excluding
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and contiguous areas, is:
							firefights 63; North Koreans 81 KIA, 33 captured; <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s (<gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_KNP1">KNP</gloss> and civilians) 40
							KIA, (including four or five farmers murdered), 88 WIA. These figures do
							not include another sizeable number of agents and collaborators picked
							up by normal police action. We have identified in action about a dozen
							teams of from seven to sixteen <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s each
							but are hard put to figure how many overall actually have been
							introduced so far, but might be as many as twenty. Rainy season now
							beginning will facilitate <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
							infiltration if <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s wish to continue
							buildup. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s with our support are
							giving them a really rough time and civil population is being
							extraordinarily helpful. With difficulties of getting food and of
							resupply, plus loyalty to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of the
							people, the para-guerrilla effort so far this year has faced real
							difficulties.</p>
                        <p>9. Embassy and UNC for past year or so have taken position that internal
							security of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> against agent and
							subversive activity should be function of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilian security and police agencies, with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military supporting internal operations
							only when necessary while concentrating on trying to stop infiltration
							through <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or by interceptions at sea.
								<pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0297"/>We have emphasized internal
							security should be prime responsibility of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> not UNC though we of course willing to help when
							needed. President Park now considers trend of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> subversive activity potentially dangerous to sense of
							security of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> as well as to its
							economic investment programs and progress. He has in past week called
							together senior cabinet members a number of times and put heat on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and Korean National Police to
							rapidly build up better internal security capability and to reduce
							required support by military. KNP has long way to go, however, so I have
							authorized temporary use of one-and-a-third active divisions from <gloss target="#t_FROKA1">FROKA</gloss> reserve for counterguerrilla action
							in Taebaek-san and Chiri-san areas in effort to be so effective against
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> testing this year as to discourage
							next year's intensification.</p>
                        <p>10. Activities of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> 32nd division in
							Taebaek-san and 16th regiment of 8th division near Chiri-san in
							conjunction with <gloss target="#t_KNP1">KNP</gloss> has been pretty
							good so far but several suspect areas not covered. We are converting our
							annual US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> special forces exercise
							“Doksoori” from a guerrilla/counterguerrilla maneuver to a real
							counterguerrilla action to begin right after the rainy season and, with
							support from <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops and police, to
							sweep the extremely rugged parts of Chiri-san and other suspect areas. I
							consider this effort extremely important to assure no undetected <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> test enclaves survive the summer. Embassy
								[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
								declassified</hi>] and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							enthusiastically support the concept.</p>
                        <p>11. Actions along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> are also continuing
							with increasing viciousness with more planned, small-scale attacks being
							made. Firefights are occurring almost every night. A few days ago three
							more U.S. soldiers were killed. This year's score along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to date: firefights 69; <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s 64 KIA, 2 captured; <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/US 35 KIA, (including 6 U.S. KIA), 87
							WIA. Irritating factor is that in last few weeks <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> are improving
							their kill ratio.</p>
                        <p>12. Following show overall figures:</p>

							also thinks as I do that overall <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>

							Visit.</p>
                        <p>1. First meeting with Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign
							Minister, Minister of National Defense and Minister of Health and Social
							Welfare was devoted to listening to their views on conduct of war in
							Vietnam. In terms basic purpose Clifford/Taylor Mission, this meeting
							produced no significant developments beyond PriMin's hawkish views on
							countering North Vietnamese forces in <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and bombing of Haiphong. Meeting being reported by
							separate memcon.<note n="2" xml:id="d124fn2">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. After meeting briefly with President at which time <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> outlined their proposed manner of presentation to
							the President and other <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials,
							group joined PriMin and Cabinet members mentioned above. Steadman and
							Charge present on US side with <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>. Yi Hu-rak, President's principle secretary, also
							joined meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> opened discussion
							explaining why President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							had sent <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> Mission, and what purpose of
							mission was in meeting with other Vietnam allies and with President and
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ministers. He then asked Taylor
							give his report on Vietnam war.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the conduct of the Vietnam war.]</p>
                        <p>[5.] <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> continued that
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> understands
							that if the war continues the US must bear the major burden and US is
							prepared to carry the main share of men and costs. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> went on to describe the
							budgetary problems and tax increase requirements confronting President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> stressed that if President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> is to be able to get
							Congress to approve and the American people to go along with this
							necessary tax increase, he must be prepared to answer the question of
							what our allies are doing in the way of additional effort. If he has to
							answer negatively, he will not get what he feels is needed for the US to
							be able to bear the main brunt of the battle and meet most of the cost
							of the struggle. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>
							continued that we are building up our forces in Vietnam to 480,000 and
							that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> recognizes
							that we are going to have to increase these forces by very substantial
							amounts. The American people will want to know what our allies are
							sending since many of the people feel that the nations <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0300"/>of Southeast Asia and the far Pacific
							area are closer to the danger than we are.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> reinforced
								many of these points in a follow-up letter to President Pak on
								August 17. (<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library,

                        </p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> concluded saying that
							the mission had presented this statement of facts to each nation visited
							and the team recognized that each nation must make its own decision.
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> wants each to
							know what the situation is as he sees it so that these facts can be
							taken into account as each nation decides what its decision should be.
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> wishes it made
							clear that he is not requesting troops on behalf of US. The US will
							handle its problems and do its part. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> wished, however, that as each
							nation's leader looked at the problems in his own enlightened self
							interest, he should know what the US views are. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> recognizes that President Pak
							has problems but suggests, however, that the problems of the war in
							Vietnam are transcendent. He hopes President Pak will place them first
							during his considerations. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> appreciates this is a matter on which President
							Pak cannot make an immediate decision. The allies cannot rest on
							contributions to date but must go on to make additional contributions so
							that the allied military leaders can have the men and tools to get the
							job done. Taylor added that now is the time to do everything we can to
							show Hanoi the firmness of the allies and their intention not to permit
							a war of attrition to develop. We need to show Ho Chi Minh that the
							allies are prepared to put in the necessary resources to bring the war
							to an early termination. The group then broke up for lunch.</p>
                        <p>7. After lunch <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> met with Pak. Foreign Minister,
							Yi Hu-rak and Charge also present. Pak asked Clifford/Taylor to express
							thanks to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> for
							sending them to give report on the Vietnam war efforts. He has high
							regard and respect for President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s resolution to finish the Vietnam war rapidly
							in spite of many problems facing him. Pak stated he feels morally
							obligated to extend help so far as he can. He wished to say frankly that
							in view of the domestic situation it difficult to come up with decision
							at this time. One reason is that the majority of Korean people since the
							earlier dispatch of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to
							Vietnam are concerned over their own security. The last time the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> sent troops the majority of the people
							supported the government but now they express worries and apprehensions
							about <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security if more troops
							dispatched. The recent increase in North Korean agent and infiltration
							activity has added to these apprehensions and concerns of the people
							over their own security. Pak acknowledged that we have the same
							objective of settling the war as <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0301"/>rapidly as we can and he will give due consideration to how <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> can contribute. He fully appreciates
							US cannot take on whole burden and he will look into seeing how he can
							share in it.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then suggested that
							during these considerations <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> take
							into account the order of priorities set out by General Westmoreland—(1)
							the basic need is for combat infantrymen and there is a requirement for
							more infantry divisions, including a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							division; (2) there is a need for additional support units for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops; and (3) there is a need to make
							arrangements which will provide <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							civilian technicians and laborers to support the Vietnam effort.</p>
                        <p>9. Pak indicated that General Chae had asked for supporting units and for
							the dispatch of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> air force units for
							air/ground operations. Both requests were now being studied by <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d124fn4">
                                <gloss target="#t_ROKFV1">ROKFV</gloss> Commander Lieutenant General
								Chae Myung-shin later spoke to Korean journalists in Saigon, stating
								that for Korea to send additional combat troops and an air force
								unit to Vietnam would enhance <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
								defenses because of the combat experience acquired by the troops in
								Vietnam. (Telegram 693 from Seoul, August 11; National Archives and
								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> Pak then pointed out that the earlier
							dispatches of troops required National Assembly approval. However, he
							thought that in the case of support units he might be able to get away
							without seeking Assembly approval. In case of additional combat units it
							will be necessary to get National Assembly approval and he is faced with
							a difficult position on this point since the opposition is boycotting
							the Assembly.<note n="5" xml:id="d124fn5">On July 27 George S. Newman,
								Charge d'Affaires ad interim, met with the Prime Minister in advance
								of the <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> visit. Regarding additional
								Korean troops, the Prime Minister mentioned the political deadlock
								and stated that the situation must first “return to normal and there
								needs to be a cooling off period” before a decision could be made.
								He pointed out that “a matter of such importance could not be
								submitted to a one-party Assembly,” for the political opposition had
								already indicated it would resist sending additional combat troops
								to Vietnam. (Memorandum of conversation, July 27, attached to a
								letter from Newman to <persName>Bundy</persName>, July 28; ibid.,
									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> in concluding meeting
							pointed out that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> felt close friendship and excellent working
							relationship existed between himself and President Pak. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> then suggested that Pak after
							he had finished his deliberations and reached his conclusions might wish
							to write directly to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, sharing these thoughts with him. President Pak
							replied that he would be happy to do so.<note n="6" xml:id="d124fn6">In
								his July 27 conversation with Newman, the Prime Minister suggested
								that the question of additional troops would best be handled between
								President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and
								President Pak. In his subsequent letter Newman urged
									<persName>Bundy</persName> “to give serious thought to the use
								of this tactic if and when we have to ask for additional Korean
								troop contribution. I become more convinced that at the right time
								this can be the key to success.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I feel that visit here has been
							useful and profitable. Pak understands our problems and wants to help
							but he has his problems. <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0302"/>He may
							be prepared to help out in near future on support units and civilian
							technicians. On major combat troops, however, his domestic political
							problems are a major stumbling block and he did not predict when that
							will be solved. It is certain he will do nothing on this front until
							things here are back to normal on political front.</p>
                        <p>12. Pak's references to concerns of the people over <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security relates to the price for any
							combat troops sent to Vietnam. It means they will have to be replaced
							here and modernized at US expense. We can expect the price to include
							something to help <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> counter North
							Korean agent and infiltration activities. Though it did not come out in
							our discussion there are likely to be other requests in economic and
							possibly political area to make any future combat troop dispatch more
							palatable and acceptable to Korean people.</p>
                        <p>13. With reference to summit meeting they felt any idea of meeting is
							good but should be looked at after <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>
							elections to decide on timing and place.</p>

                        <p>1. Since my arrival I have had an intensive and careful look at the
							internal security problem here. I have gone into the matter at
							considerable length with Gen <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> and <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> as
							well as Emb [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
								declassified</hi>] officers. The <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss>
							assessment contained reftel has my full endorsement. I particularly want
							to underscore <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0303"/>the urgency of
							meeting the problem now and with vigor and ingenuity. The <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> elements have a well developed and
							thoroughly integrated concept of how to deal with the threat and have
							been working closely with all agencies, civil and military, of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is moving on the problem and in the right direction.
							We need to move with them if our help is to be meaningful and
							timely.</p>
                        <p>2. The government, particularly Pres Pak, see the task of dealing with
							the agent/infiltrator problem as one for which the civilian agencies
							must be properly equipped and trained and not one which should be
							permitted significantly to divert the attention and energies of the
							armed forces from their primary mission along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and the offshore waters. We have
							strongly encouraged this attitude at all levels in the government. If
							this attitude and momentum is to be sustained and the goals achieved,
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s will need selective help from
							us in a timely manner. The help we provide now, though unanticipated
							when our programs were first developed, can prevent more serious
							problems later that will be far more costly to eliminate.</p>
                        <p>3. In the next few days, <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> will be
							submitting urgent program changes relating to the Korean National Police
								(<gloss target="#t_KNP1">KNP</gloss>).<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">Not found.</note> These are critical for the effective development
							of the police is the key to maintaining the civilian agency orientation
							in coping with the agent/infiltrator problem that Pres Pak wants. (I
							understand he talked at great length on this point during the lunch he
							had with <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName> and Gen
							Taylor.) I am not urging a normal police improvement program but one
							with a specific purpose and goal—stopping a serious <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> agent/infiltrator threat to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that is on the doorstep and before it

							as well as in a subsequent letter to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, President Pak outlined
							domestic problems affecting his ability to dispatch additional troops
							abroad. Those problems involved public concerns about Korea's own
							security and defense capabilities, particularly in light of the
							escalation in incidents along the Demilitarized Zone and in North Korean
							infiltration activities. President Pak also indicated that any final
							decision depended on the extent to which equipment and anti-infiltration

							Vietnam in 1966 had been furnished. (Telegram 1120 from Seoul, September
							5, and letter from President Pak to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, September 8; both ibid.) The

                        </p>
                        <p>1. After careful weighing of Korean factors and atmosphere, I am
							submitting following proposal for Dept/<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> consideration in connection with current <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> study, requested by Pres Pak, of
							numbers of additional troops which might be sent to Vietnam and method
							of recruiting them. In presenting this proposal my aim is to (1) get
							more <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops to Vietnam; (2) minimize
							the cost impact of the additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							contribution on our own budgetary and foreign exchange burden in
							immediate future; and (3) improve domestic position of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to extent which will permit it to
							take necessary action in Assembly and evoke public support for dispatch
							of more troops.</p>
                        <p>2. We have previously explained why we must help Pak overcome domestic
							political obstacles in this connection. Our task is not becoming easier
							because boldness of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> sabotage of <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and pressure on <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> itself is creating (as it is undoubtedly designed to
							do) in public mind much uneasiness about <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ability to defend itself. Moreover, when railroad
							sabotage is carried out miles south of <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and relatively close to nation's capital, it involves
							face and builds up <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> desire for
							riposte. In circumstances, question naturally arises whether new
							military manpower should be used at home rather than in defense of
							country two thousand miles away.</p>
                        <p>3. My concept on timing is to make known to Pak that as soon as he has
							considered <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> report mentioned above
							that I would like to discuss it with him. If atmosphere suitable I would
							at that time say we have been giving much thought to matter of his need
							to reassure assembly and public about security of country, particularly
							in relation to possible troop dispatch.</p>
                        <p>4. I would tell Pak that I was authorized, in consideration of an
							additional troop dispatch, to say that the US was prepared to<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">In reply the Departments of State and Defense

                        <p>D. Agree that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces serving in
								<gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> when hostilities ceased would
							retain and return home with special equipment we have loaned to them for
							combat operations in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">Telegram 42939 also authorized <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> to make general references

								item 4D because of the potentially negative Korean response to it
								and because the dollar amounts involved could not yet be
								determined.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. In presentation of above I would point out that first two items intend
							make sure <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense capability not
							lessened and no economic burden placed on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy due to dispatch. Third item designed to meet in
							timely manner intensified NK infiltration threat and to provide tangible
							and visible evidence to Korean people to reassure them of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s ability deal with <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> threat. Last item aimed at enhancing
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> long-term defense posture.</p>
                        <p>6. Please have in mind possibility that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> may consciously or sub-consciously expect to retain
							equipment on loan to them in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and may
							adopt a “thank-you-for-nothing” attitude. Much of equipment they are
							using in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> would of course be well worn
							at time of implementation of any such agreement but we would not expect
							this to be major factor in their consideration of proposal. Similarly
							they are very likely to feel that the “anti-infiltration” help is
							something we would do anyway, given our concerns over <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security, our treaty commitments and
							our pledges.</p>
                        <p>7. I submit the above suggestion which I consider to be a barebones
							minimum for even a token additional contribution because it meets
							considerations cited para one above. These proposals should induce Pak
							to begin thinking in specific terms and possibly undertaking necessary
							initial preparations of public opinion for another dispatch. Among
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military elements above
							arrangements would probably be regarded with favor, and Pak is not
							insensitive to opinion from that quarter. We would ensure that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s do not miss point that by contributing
							more troops now they can expect to enhance their own defense capability
							during post hostilities period when <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							can be expected to phase down markedly. Please note that I have not
							included in my suggested offer anything that touches on the economic
							side and that the offer is “de minimis” insofar as <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military modernization is concerned.
							How much further we go in any offer should, in large part, depend on the
							size of the additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> dispatch.</p>
                        <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0310"/>
                        <p>8. We would like to try these proposals on for size and they should at
							least evoke their counter-proposals. I am particularly interested in
							seeing what they come back with in the economic area which may be the
							real key to the problem. If they renew their proposal that we negotiate
							logistics and tech assistance package for <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>, I would state our willingness to negotiate such, as
							indicated President's message to Pak, but I would point out that <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> approval of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US agreement in that sense not likely during next few
							months at least in view changing patter [pattern?] of govt and Assembly
							in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and that proposal for
							“anti-infiltration” help their retention of equipment used in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> much more useful to assure public that
							govt dealing effectively with problem of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security.</p>
                        <p>9. Please let me have your comments or questions as soon as convenient. I
							wish to stress that my suggestion in para four is only an opener to get
							the process moving with an air of specificity about it. If the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is thinking in terms of one-half to a
							full division, my package will not come close to meeting the Bill.</p>

                        <p>On September 16, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> in his capacity as Commander in Chief, United
							Nations Command, briefed President Park Chung Hee at the latter's
							request on the Demilitarized Zone infiltration problems and North Korean
							subversive activities. The briefing lasted over one hour and was
							attended on the Korean side also by the Minister of <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0311"/>National Defense and Yi Hu-Rak. Brig.
							General Huffman was also present.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> first
							briefed the President, following an outline in English and Korean which
							had been distributed. President Park listened attentively. The outline
							covered: (1) enemy threat, both conventional and subversive war aspect;
							(2) actions taken by friendly elements with regard to increased
							Demilitarized Zone incidents; (3) actions taken regarding North Korean
							agent and guerrilla activities in the interior; and, (4) future
							cooperative self-help, mutual support and development of further
							plans.</p>
                        <p>When the briefing was finished, the President himself spoke at length. He
							stated that he and the people of Korea fully respected and supported
							United Nations Command authority over the Republic of Korea Armed Forces
							and he had full confidence in the United Nations Command's ability to
							carry out its mission for defending the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated he agreed with General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>'s detailed views on
							anti-infiltration operations and was well satisfied with actions taken
							or being taken. He would like to see comprehensive requirements plan now
							being completed worked out as soon as possible and hoped that it would
							stop enemy infiltration through the Demilitarized Zone and along the
							coast.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had been a division commander along the
							Demilitarized Zone and fully understands the problem. A full effort
							would limit enemy activities but would not, he feared, stop them
							completely because of the great length of the coast line and the
							Demilitarized zone.</p>
                        <p>He said he would like to get at even more basic factors. The basic
							problem is that the North Koreans do not intend to abide by the
							armistice nor will they. Unless they give up their announced goal, we
							can expect further intensification of efforts to cause sabotage and
							subvert the Republic of Korea next spring and on indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>The difference between United Nations Command and North Korean
							operational concepts is as follows: Our concept is defensive—to defend
							the Republic of Korea against aggression; North Korean concept is
							offensive—to wage subversive aggression against the Republic of Korea,
							to reconnoiter and attack industrial and military installations and to
							create continuously what damage to the feeling of security of the South
							Korean people that they can. They will do this so long as they feel that
							it can be done at no risk to North Korea and from the sanctuary the
							United Nations Command provides by unilaterally abiding by the
							armistice.</p>
                        <p>The President said that during the past fourteen years, there have been
							about 5,000 significant North Korean violations of the armistice. <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0312"/>As for our side, he said, he
							would have to admit to some few violations by Republic of Korea. These
							occurred because of the hatred engendered by North Korean attacks on our
							soldiers. However, the ratio of violations is several hundred to one on
							the enemy side.</p>
                        <p>Whenever the North Koreans violate the military demarcation line, the
							President said, all the United Nations Command has done so far is to
							table the complaint at Panmunjom, where the North Koreans categorically
							deny it. For the last 14 years, the United Nations Command has abided by
							the armistice while the North Korean side has ignored it.</p>
                        <p>The President believes that we must do our best to capture or kill every
							North Korean infiltrator into the Republic of Korea in order to make
							enemy abandon his plans. He foresees, nevertheless, that this alone will
							not stop the North Koreans and he expects more violations along the
							Demilitarized Zone and increased efforts to sabotage industrial and
							military installations. We should, he said, do more than table the
							problem at Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>The President said he believes that counter-measures are most important
							to stop North Korean attacks, whenever the North Koreans violate the
							armistice they must be made to pay by retaliation.<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">On September 4 CINCUNC received information about
									<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliatory raids into North
								Korea along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and reminded the

								(Telegram 1136 from Seoul, September 5; ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> also voiced concern about
								the forays to the Prime Minister, stressing that such actions
								undercut the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s position at the
									<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, provided fodder for North

                        </p>
                        <p>The President went on to make the following interesting statement. He
							said that he respects the fact that Republic of Korea forces are under
							the operational control of the United Nations Command and therefore
							retaliations will never be done without due coordination with the
							Command. However, unless the United Nations Command undertakes strong
							measures, the people of Korea will complain increasingly against the
							Korean Government. We have, he said, almost 600,000 men in the armed
							forces. If no counter-measures are taken, the people's patience will
							wear very thin. The President then said he would be very grateful if
							General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> would tell
							him what countermeasures the United Nations will take if the enemy
							continues and intensifies his attacks.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> stated that
							he was sure the President understood his position. That he is a soldier
							and he follows orders and that his mission was very clear, that he was
							not only to defend the Republic of Korea against Communist aggression
							but also to enforce the armistice. He had to agree that there was a
							plausibility to the President's <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0313"/>evaluation of North Korean intentions but that the matter was a most
							complex one and that there were many factors of great policy import to
							Korea and to U.S. involved in this question.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said that he
							thought that the name and the meaning of the “United Nations Command” is
							highly useful and important to the Republic of Korea, especially in
							these days of Communist activity over much of Asia. It should be
							remembered that the United Nations Unified Command in Korea was
							established by the Security Council of the United Nations in 1950. The
							United States Government had been designated as the executive agent for
							the Security Council to direct the operations of the Unified Command in
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>The composition of the United Nations has changed greatly since 1950.
							Undoubtedly, one of many reasons for the increased North Korean activity
							was a hope by the Communists that they could at some time in the
							proximate future get the U.N. General Assembly to repudiate the United
							Nations Command in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Since the matter was of such great importance and so complex, unilateral
							action by the Republic of Korea would be bad and it would be wisest
							course for the President to discuss the matter with the personal
							representative of President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in Korea, that is, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said he felt it important
							both for Korea and the U.S. that the integrity of the United Nations
							Command be preserved. It might not be impossible to find other adequate
							answers to President Park's expressed concept but this should be done by
							explorations in greatest confidence with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>. President Park, he felt sure,
							appreciated that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> himself had troubles with small but vocal
							elements of the U.S. public and that there were many critics of U.S.
							policy towards Vietnam who confused some of the American public.
							Certainly the wisest course would not be to totally abandon to the
							Communists the full initiative to do what they wished, but it was a fact
							that it would be hard to preserve and continue the United Nations
							Command in Korea if the Command were party to violating the
							armistice.</p>
                        <p>President Park stated he fully understood General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>'s position. He said he
							did not mean to imply that the United Nations Command should take the
							total retaliatory reaction against North Korean aggression. However, he
							felt if the North Korean actions continued to increase, authority should
							be given to the Commanding Chief of the United Nations Command to wage
							coordinated, carefully controlled, small-scale retaliatory action. He
							said he would talk to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> about this. The President went on in an
							apparently philosophical mood and said that it was his frank view that
							the United States Government applies too many restrictions and red tape
							on the authority of U.S. theater commanders. This, he said, applies also
							to Vietnam. His next sentence, as interpreted into English, went to the
							effect that the U.S. Government <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0314"/>might lose something but so does the Republic of Korea through
							continued and vicious North Korean aggressions. The North Koreans, he
							said, are fully aware of the heavy U.S. commitments in Vietnam and
							believe the U.S. does not want the extension of another front in Korea.
							Hence, the North Koreans feel relatively safe against retaliation. He
							thought the North Koreans do not want open hostilities but felt secure
							against risk in the subversive actions they were now taking
							increasingly.</p>
                        <p>In closing the meeting, the President said that the matter requires most
							serious thought and a prudent approach. However, only positive and
							appropriate counter-measures will stop the North Koreans.<note n="3" xml:id="d129fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> concluded from his
								comments that Pak intended to put the U.S. “on notice that northward
								actions by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> personnel will
								continue at a greater pace and with greater vigor than in the past,
								with or without U.S. cooperation.” The United States could expect to
								be informed of South Korean incursions after they occurred, so that
								U.S. forces in Korea could be prepared for possible retaliation by
								North Korea. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
								recommended reminding Pak of U.S. disapproval of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> incursions and requesting “<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> discuss with UNC means of making
								North Korean actions more costly for <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> elements as they occur.” (Telegram 1483 from Seoul,
								September 22; ibid.) <persName>Bundy</persName> concurred with
									<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>'s recommendation
								and stated that the matter was being given “urgent attention” in
								Washington. (Telegram 45165 to Seoul, September 28; ibid.) On
								October 11 <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> discussed
								his approach with Pak, who was receptive to meeting North Korean
								actions as they occurred. (Telegram 1797 from Seoul, October 11;

                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. We believe that the recent, more vigorous activities of North Korea
							against the South have several motivations: to create new pressures <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0315"/>on the Pak government; to tie
							down large <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces; to strengthen the
							Communist clandestine apparatus in the South; and to be in a position to
							exploit any new and major disruption in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. The timing of these tactics has been strongly
							influenced by the Vietnamese War, for example by such factors as the
							absence of 50,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in South
							Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>B. The North Koreans will almost certainly continue their campaign of
							military harassment in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, at
							current or even increased levels. We believe that North Korea undertook
							its program of violence of its own volition, not under pressure from
							either Moscow or Peking, and that this program does not indicate a
							present Communist intention to invade South Korea. Pyongyang is
							conscious of the risks inherent in such an action and would be reluctant
							to accept them. Similarly, there is probably no intention of escalating
							the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> attacks to a point at which open
							warfare might result. The North might miscalculate, however, and raise
							the ante along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> until the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> resolves to strike back in force. A
							series of actions and reactions might ensue which could lead to open
							hostilities.</p>
                        <p>C. North Korea will also continue attempts to infiltrate guerrilla-type
							teams into rear areas of South Korea. Communist chances of establishing
							viable bases for guerrilla operations are probably poor, but some teams
							will be able to carry out short-term terrorist and sabotage
								missions.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">As a result of North Korea's
								“current activities” and “its incipient campaign of terror and
								sabotage in rear areas of South Korea,” on October 25 the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss> agreed that intelligence efforts
								concerning the political, economic, and military situation in North
								Korea should be increased. (Memorandum for the United States

								Korea.<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2">The Vice President and the Prime
								Minister were in Saigon to attend inauguration ceremonies for the
								newly elected Thieu-Ky government. <persName>Bundy</persName>
								arranged the meeting at <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>'s request after being advised that <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> had received
								information indicating that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
								planned further actions against North Korea. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> recommended that since
								Humphrey “enjoys great prestige in Korea” he could caution the
								Koreans against such actions and demonstrate that the “matter has
								come to attention of highest levels of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.” (Telegram 2119 from Seoul, October 27, and
								telegram 61160 to Seoul, October 27; both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. After an exchange of greetings, the Prime Minister stated that during
							his recent visit to Washington President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had voiced concern about North Korean
							infiltration into South Korea. At that time the Prime Minister
							understood that a Bill authorizing three destroyers for Korea had passed
							the House of Representatives, and been forwarded to the Senate Armed
							Services Committee. He has recently learned that the request for two of
							these destroyers was cancelled by the Armed Services Committee of the
							Senate. This will have unfortunate political repercussions in Korea as
							these three destroyers are badly needed to patrol their 600-mile coastal
							area. In view of the relationship of Korean public opinion to the
							Vietnamese war, the loss of the two destroyers is actually less
							important than the decline in the morale of the Korean people. If the
							Korean Government should in the future attempt to <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0317"/>increase its troop strength in Vietnam,
							the opposition can effectively use this destroyer issue to criticize the
							government and weaken its position.</p>
                        <p>2. The Vice President stated that he would check into this matter of
							destroyers carefully. The U.S. has received a number of requests for
							destroyers and for modern jet airplanes recently, including requests
							from a number of South American countries. There has been a general
							reaction in the Congress against excessive military assistance in the
							past, and this has resulted in a tendency to refuse all requests. The
							Vice President counseled patience and stated that he believed the matter
							could be worked out.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">The Korean press
								reported that “Humphrey had agreed in principle that the US will
								provide two destroyers.” <persName>Bundy</persName> labeled the
								statement a “mischaracterization” that was “tantamount to an attempt
								to blackmail us” and one that could jeopardize Congressional
								reconsideration of the matter. (Telegram 64926 to Seoul, November 4;
								ibid.) Noting he would bring the matter to the attention of the
								Prime Minister as soon as possible, <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> also explained that the “use of press by
								[Korean] government is most trying aspect of doing business here,”
								since high-level officials “endeavor to make themselves look good in
								press by representing statements of Americans and others in manner
								bearing little resemblance to facts, and designed, as you say, to
								blackmail us.” (Telegram 2256 from Seoul, November 6; ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The Prime Minister stated that he hoped so as this had become a matter
							of great urgency in Korea during the past year. 450 South Koreans had
							been killed during the past year. The Korean Government is incapable of
							countering espionage activities along the sea coast because when they
							detect North Korean attempts, they cannot catch them because they do not
							have the fast boats required. They anticipate that North Korea will
							accelerate its attempts to disrupt the internal security, the political
							stability and economic growth of South Korea in the next several years.
							Whereas the North Koreans trained 900 guerrillas this year, they are
							planning to train 2,500 next year for the purpose of sabotage in South
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>4. The Prime Minister confirmed that Korea had received the
							communications equipment and radar requested earlier. General
							Westmoreland assured the Vice President that Korean forces in South
							Vietnam received the same equipment as American forces. The Vice
							President asked the Prime Minister directly if the U.S. is failing to
							provide anything the Koreans expected. Is the U.S. keeping up with
							shipments of equipment to the regular forces in Korea?</p>
                        <p>5. The Prime Minister expressed appreciation for the continued presence
							of U.S. forces in Korea, and expressed the hope that deliveries on the
							equipment promised—such as trucks and jeeps could be speeded [up].</p>
                        <p>6. As of this date only 30 percent of the total commitment has been
							fulfilled. Also the Korean troops are using outmoded weapons <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0318"/>and hope to be able to obtain modern
							weapons soon. In response to the Vice President's question he stated
							that he was talking about M16 rifles. The Vice President said that
							although we have had a supply line problem on rifles, we intend to keep
							our word on this. In response to the Prime Minister's specific
							expression of their interest in helicopters, the Vice President said
							that we would review this but that the Prime Minister should understand
							that General Westmoreland has first priority on helicopters. The Prime
							Minister said he hoped that Korea would have second priority. He stated
							that he would be happy to pass the word to President Park that Vice
							President Humphrey “would take care of this matter.” The Vice President
							said it would be more accurate to say that “he would look into it.”</p>
                        <p>6. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] The Vice President expressed the
							gratitude of American Government and the American people for the Korean
							participation in the Vietnam war. He is aware that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> has been talking to President
							Park about the possibility of additional troops for Vietnam. He knows of
							the political problems that this might cause and has not been sent by
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to make any
							request for additional troops. But Korea is among the few close and
							trusted allies the U.S. has in Asia, and Korea is among those countries
							that will benefit from the increased commitment which the U.S. has made
							to Asia. We have no desire to tell Asians how to run their lives, but we
							both need each other. In such a situation there is no doubt that we will
							need more help in Vietnam. The details of this subject can be discussed
							in Seoul. When the world knows that we all stand together in Asia, the
							Communist forces will draw the appropriate conclusion. The Prime
							Minister should know that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> stands by his friends and helps those who help
							us.</p>
                        <p>7. The Prime Minister stated that Korea is not afraid of any sacrifices
							that are required. Korea will stay with the U.S. till the final victory
							in Vietnam and this is important not only for Vietnam but for Korea and
							the United States.</p>
                        <p>8. The Prime Minister referring to the recent demonstrations in
							Washington against the war, stated that we might want to send those
							demonstrators to Korea and have them brainwashed there. Perhaps at the
							next Seven Nation Conference it would be well to mobilize 200,000 people
							in all the nations in support of the war to offset the demonstrations
							against the war.</p>
                        <p>9. The Vice President stated that the U.S. is aware of the great problem
							presented by the infiltration from North Korea. But South Korea must not
							respond unilaterally, must not act without consultations with General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> or if necessary
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>. On this
							matter, as on all others, we must think and act in concert. We are aware
							of the pressures to respond to these provocations, but unilateral action
								<pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0319"/>can only lead to
							misunderstanding. He asked the Prime Minister to pass on this message to
							President Park. The Prime Minister made no response to the Vice
							President's remarks on this subject.</p>
                        <p>10. The Prime Minister expressed concern about the possibility of
							restrictions on the importation of Korean goods into the U.S. For the
							past 18 years, U.S. officials have encouraged Korea to increase its
							exports. Korea has succeeded in doing this and now its exports total
							$350 million. They hope to continue increasing their trade so they can
							eventually end their reliance on U.S. economic assistance. But to be
							self-sustaining they must have the possibility of increased trade.</p>
                        <p>11. The Vice President stated that there is increasing protectionist
							sentiment in the Congress, from industries such as steel, textiles,
							glass and others. We have to take a look at our textile situation and
							possibly we might want to consider discussing extending the present long
							term agreement on textiles, to permit both nations to share in the
							growth of the market for man-made fibers. There are strong pressures
							here, but the U.S. will not act precipitously in this matter.</p>
                        <p>12. The Prime Minister also asked why the U.S. is so strict about its Buy
							America policy. Korea expected to benefit considerably from off-shore
							procurement but has in fact realized very little. In 1966, offshore
							procurement for Vietnam amounted to $30 million while for 1967 it has
							fallen off to $6.5 million.</p>
                        <p>13. The Vice President encouraged the Prime Minister to think in terms of
							competitive trading. The Koreans should have trade missions and not rely
							wholly on the American market. We hope to maintain the American market
							as an open market, but nevertheless the Koreans might do well to find
							new outlets for their production. The Koreans should also use their
							special position with the U.S. public to explain their problem to the
							U.S. Congress and Senators. As one who worked hard for the success of
							the Kennedy Round, the Vice President stated he would do all he could to
							resist protectionists' pressures in the U.S. but this would not be
							easy.</p>
                        <p>14. Addressing General Westmoreland, the Prime Minister asked if it might
							be possible for the American logistics command in Vietnam to hire
							Koreans for maintenance positions from the groups of Koreans who have
							completed their military service in South Vietnam. This has now become a
							problem for Korean veterans returning from Vietnam who do not always
							have suitable opportunities for employment in Korea.</p>
                        <p>15. The Prime Minister stated that he had been told that the U.S. is
							agreeable but that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is opposed to
							this. He had discussed this with Prime Minister Ky in Feb. and although
							he agreed in principle, nothing has happened. This has been discussed
							many times during the past year but with no results. General
							Westmoreland responded <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0320"/>that he
							had recently instructed his staff to look into this matter. With a new
							government coming into power, and a new draft law which would absorb
							65,000 more men, he believes that the situation is now more hopeful. He
							has the matter under detailed study and believes it possible that
							something can be worked out in the near future.</p>
                        <p>16. In conclusion, Westmoreland expressed to the Prime Minister his great
							admiration for the performance of Korean soldiers in Vietnam and for
							their leaders. He specifically praised General Chae and presented the
							Prime Minister with a highly favorable report on the Korean forces which
							had been prepared by his staff.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister stated that North Korean harassment of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							troops along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> was taking place on
							a large scale <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0321"/>and that
							infiltration of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> further south by
							North Korean agents was a serious problem. When asked by the Secretary
							to explain North Korean motives, Choe replied that he thought the North
							Koreans were attempting to accomplish two objectives. The first was to
							slow down the rate of economic progress in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the second was to stimulate tension within the
							country.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether any changes had been noticed in the
							deployment of the North Korean armed forces. <persName>Choe</persName>
							replied that new airfields were being built in the North and that the
							North Korean forces were being equipped with new Soviet equipment.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">As recorded in Part VII, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested to Choe that other
								governments in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command should
								be discreetly apprised of the situation. Cautioning that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should respond to North Korean
								actions with considerable restraint, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reminded Choe of the consequences of any
								significant North-South conflict and stated that “if any such clash
								occurred the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should appear to
								be the victim of aggression” since the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> “needs the support and sympathy of many foreign
								governments” and, therefore, should keep its record clean. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> also instructed Kohler to

                        <p>In view of the North Korean activities which he had just described, the
							Foreign Minister urged greater effort in improving the capability of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to counter the North
							Korean activities which he had just described. He urged that the
							equipment of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces be
							modernized and referred specifically to the need for fast patrol
							boats.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> pointed out that the
							fast patrol boats referred to were in the process of being delivered to
							Korea. Ambassador Kim countered by stating the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> possessed only one destroyer and needed more. The
							Foreign Minister emphasized that in view of the establishment of
							small-scale guerrilla forces by the North Koreans, there was need for
							anti-infiltration equipment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> pointed out that a great deal of such equipment
							had already been provided to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government and that more was on the way.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Joint Working Group</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then referred to the establishment of the joint
								US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> working group in Seoul, with
							military and economic sub-committees, to explore the extent to which the
							commitments made in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s letter of March 4, 1966, had been carried out.
							He reported that the military sub-committee had worked out a project for
							providing additional equipment and he hoped that the working group's
							report, including this project, would soon be ready for submission.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Participation in Viet-Nam </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister pointed out that the working group was also
							considering the problem of increasing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> participation in programs in Viet-Nam. He said that
							although <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> exports in general were
							rising, his government wished to increase its exports to Viet-Nam.
							Participation was also desired in the pacification program in Viet-Nam.
							Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> pointed out that
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> receipts from Viet-Nam,
							including remittances, for the first half of 1967 totaled $60 million,
							which was equal to the total receipts from the same sources for all of
							1966. The Foreign Minister did not deny the accuracy of these figures
							but said that his government keenly desired to increase exports to
							Viet-Nam. It also wished to participate in the pacification program and
							it had proposed a Korean Logistic Service Corps designed to relieve for
							combat duty troops now serving in rear areas. The Secretary asked if the
								<gloss target="#t_KLSC1">KLSC</gloss> was intended to be a military
							unit. The Foreign Minister replied that the intention was to have it
							comprise civilian reservists who would act as guards, drivers, etc., in
							the rear areas.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then referred to his government's desire that Korean
							firms be given a chance to participate in bidding on contracts for
							delivery of goods and services in Viet-Nam. He alleged that Korean
							troops in Viet-Nam were wearing underwear manufactured in the United
							States and that Korean textile-makers should be given the opportunity to
							bid on such items. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>
							reminded the Foreign Minister that certain actions had been taken above
							and beyond the commitments of the March 4 letter. He cited specifically
							the provision of Korean combat rations to the Korean troops in
							Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the present situation in Viet-Nam was that
							large bids went to U.S. firms and small bids to Vietnamese firms. If the
							Koreans tried to compete on the small bids, it might cause difficulties
							with the Vietnamese. Therefore, they desired to share some of the
							contracts which now went to U.S. bidders. He said the National Assembly
							had set a deadline of mid-November, after which it had threatened to
							begin interpellations of the government on these subjects. He hoped,
							therefore, that the joint working group's report would be finished by
							that deadline.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> commented that he was
							certain that the working group's report would show that the U.S.
							Government had performed very well in living up to its commitments.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Recent developments indicate <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							domestic political situation may soon be restored to something
							approaching normalcy. This raises question of when and how we approach
							Pak on additional troop dispatch for Vietnam. We have been deferring any
							real pressure on him in recognition of his domestic political problem.
							However, time is approaching when this should no longer be overriding
							consideration. Before proceeding with Pak, believe we should reevaluate
							prospects for and consequences of additional troop dispatch in light of
							recent developments and present conditions.</p>
                        <p>2. Situation with respect to further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							contributions is not the same as it was for earlier dispatches or even
							last spring and summer. Since Vice President's visit and <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> mission, the picture here has changed
							sufficiently to warrant examining the desirability of a further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> contribution, particularly in light
							future disadvantages and difficulties it may create for US in our total
							relationships with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>A. Recent statements by US officials on better prospects in Vietnam,
							including prospects for troop withdrawal and lessening need for
							additional US troops have been noted here and may lead Pak and his
							advisers, and Korean public as well, to question need for additional
							dispatch in light of pressures along Korean <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and perhaps other areas of country next spring. General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName>'s talk with Pak this
							week, for example, clearly reflected optimistic view on military outlook
							in Vietnam which Beach had received in Saigon.</p>
                        <p>B. Increased <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> activity during past year
							along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and interior has disturbed
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Govt and the Korean people. They
							now anticipate greater North Korean efforts at infiltration, subversion
							and sabotage next year and are exhibiting considerable concern over
							security in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. In past, <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> was prepared send troops to Vietnam
							if this did not impair ability handle threat from the North. In light of
							anticipated increase <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> activity,
							important sectors of opinion are already saying <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0324"/>that troops cannot be spared and any
							dispatch would spur North to increase pressure against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s not likely to be in position to
							act on any new troop dispatch until early next year since National
							Assembly action would be required nor could troops be deployed until
							well into year due to planning and implementation lead time required. In
							meantime, announcements of increase by Thailand, New Zealand and
							Australia will have become past history and if you decide that I should
							maintain pressure, it may look as though <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> alone is being subjected to pressure from US.</p>
                        <p>D. There has been growing feeling in <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and Korean public that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop dispatch to Vietnam has strengthened “special
							relationship” between US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> which
							justifies having their desires, whether in political, economic or
							defense area, being given special and unique consideration by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. They display considerable assuredness
							in presenting this theme and complete insensitivity to problems that
							granting special treatment would create for US domestically and
							internationally. They are uninhibited in expressing their demands or
							their disappointment when they do not meet with specific encouragement.
							In short, they see the 50,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops
							in Vietnam as their “Alladin's Lamp” to make all their dreams come
							true.</p>
                        <p>E. Pak will have domestic political problems particularly in the National
							Assembly if he seeks to send additional troops. Though he and other
							government spokesmen have carefully hedged their statements on dispatch
							of troops, they continue to give opposition and public grounds to
							believe <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has strongly implied if
							not pledged that it will not send additional troops. Opposition will
							seek to take issue with any troop dispatch proposal in effort to
							embarrass Pak and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. Opposition will
							find greater public acceptance of their arguments because of pressures
							mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>F. On size of any possible dispatch, we are not as optimistic now as when
							we were considering matter earlier. We are inclined to believe that Pak
							is currently thinking more in terms of another brigade and supporting

                        <p>2621. Subj: <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Internal Security.</p>
                        <p>1. In recent weeks there have been a number of developments relating to
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> preparations in internal
							security field for next spring's anticipated intensified <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> infiltration effort.</p>
                        <p>A. President Pak has disapproved Korean National Police plans to double
							size of combat police forces from 23 companies to 46 companies and to
							improve coastal watch organization. Police plan submitted to Pak would
							have required a won 1.1 <persName>Billion</persName> supplemental budget
							as well as about $5 million in equipment (commo, transport, patrol
							boats, helicopters etc.) to be furnished by U.S.</p>
                        <p>B. President Pak has approved for planning purposes strengthening of
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army for counter-infiltration
							activities by 8 new counter-infiltration battalions in each of 8 reserve
							divisions under second <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army. <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> plan presented to Pak points out that
							this would require by contrast with police plan a supplemental budget of
							won 317 million and that equipment for battalions is on hand in reserve
							divisional stocks.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> Kim on Nov 22 sent letter to
							COMUS/K advising him of plan to organize 8 battalions, stated that
							personnel strength of these battalions will be temporary augmentation of
							present authorized strength of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army.
								<gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> has not requested COMUS/K
							concurrence of this augmentation but requested concurrence for use of
							equipment from <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army stocks for new
							battalions.</p>
                        <p>D. At briefing given to senior U.S. personnel by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> on military counter-infiltration
							plans, as tentatively approved by President Pak, <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> said <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military would
							assume control of <gloss target="#t_CI1">CI</gloss> operations in those
							areas and situations where experience shows that police lack capability
							to cope with infiltration situation.</p>
                        <p>2. Understand President Pak disapproved increase in police and approved
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army battalions because
							use of military was budgetarily much cheaper. On basis information
							available to him Pak believes North Korean infiltration threat south of
							the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> will be of magnitude that will
							require the use of military forces and even augmented police will be
							unable cope with this level <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> activity.
							Pak <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0327"/> concerned by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> sabotage efforts aimed at <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> industrial base and at govt
							organization, including use of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							military “suicide squads” for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military now submitting requests
							to COMUS/K for assist- ance on variety of projects to improve
							capability. To assure coordinated U.S. efforts in dealing with requests
							from the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military and civilian
							agencies and to assure that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							develops the soundest possible plan for dealing with the intensified
							infiltration next spring, Country Team has established a special
							committee chaired by <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> to include
								<gloss target="#t_USFK1">USFK</gloss> Chief of Staff, Chief, <gloss target="#t_PROVMAAG1">PROVMAAG</gloss>/K, Deputy <gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> Director [<hi rend="italic">less than
								1 line of source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: We see problem of dealing with
							internal security matters to be responsibilities of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> providing such assistance as it can. We also continue
							believe that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilian agencies,
							primarily augmented <gloss target="#t_KNP1">KNP</gloss>, are best
							instrument for dealing initially with various aspects of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> activity in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> outside of forward areas under <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military control and that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military effort should be focused along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, coast and offshore as collateral
							activity to their regular military missions and providing spot
							assistance to civilian authorities when requested. We believe present
							concept reportedly accepted by Pak that military forces be applied if
							dimension of threat such that civil agencies cannot handle is sound. Pak
							of course will decide when and if to bring military power to bear on
							problem, but for reasons connected with population, training problems,
							and eventual expense arising from military participation, we hope his
							judgment will be measured in this matter.</p>

							might ask in return, so that we can provide Locke with instructions and

                        <p>3. To minimize visit appearing wholly as solicitation of additional
							contribution, we would in any event wish to depict it as normal
								US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> consultation on Viet-Nam
							situation. Depending on Tokyo's judgment, we might also schedule short
							visit in Japan, recalling that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has
							expressed interest in reports on Viet-Nam situation. Possible schedule
							might take Locke to Tokyo on December 4 and 5, with visit to Seoul on
							December 6 and departure from Seoul during day December 7.</p>
                        <p>4. Request urgent Seoul and Tokyo comment on this schedule and basic
							outline. You should not approach host governments until we have final
							exchanges. Your comment should cover receptivity of host government,
							date problems, and whether you see additional elements that could be
							used effectively to further the general picture of routine consultation
							on a regularly scheduled consultation return to the US. For example,
							would it be useful or the reverse to depict Tokyo visit as related to

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Text of Cable from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> (Seoul, 2769)</p>
                        <p>The result of a two-and-one-half-hour conversation today between
							President Park, the </p>
                        <p>Prime Minister, the Minister of National Defense and the Foreign Minister
							on one hand, and Locke and <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
							on the other, was that the South Korean Government has agreed to make
							available one “light division” to augment allied forces in South
							Vietnam. The timing of the availability of these additional troops is to
							await South Korean Government assessment of Assembly willingness to pass
							enabling legislation. In the meantime, <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and the Minister of National Defense may open
							conversations to determine “arrangements” which will permit activation
							of such a light division.</p>
                        <p>Park, who clearly maintained control of the essentials of the
							conversation for the Koreans, said that when the Minister of Defense
							turned in a report indicating he was unable to recommend the dispatch of
							more troops because of Korean security problems, the President had
							returned the report to the Minister, telling the latter to find a way to
							meet the obvious needs of the Vietnam situation. He also made clear to
							the Minister he wished to help President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. Locke went through the points cited in a State
							Department telegram,<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">Not found.</note>
							putting special stress on the current coming U.S. troop contribution,
							the need to increase pressure on the enemy at this point when his
							problems are severe, the excellent effect additional Korean contribution
							would have on the situation, and on public and Congress in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>President Park revealed that the Defense Minister had replied to his
							request for re-study of the possibilities by indicating that if rear and
							logistical elements now supporting Korean troops in Vietnam could be
							replaced by civilians, enough combat troops would be gained to form a
							“reinforced regimental combat team.” Additionally, Park continued, this
							regiment could be found in Korea which would bring the total new
							contribution to the level of a “light division.”</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister then spoke in turn. Both
							opposed sending more troops. The former said his opposition resulted
							from the assurances given by the Americans that the previous <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0330"/>troop dispatch was the last which would
							be requested and because such assurances had been passed to the Assembly
							and the public. He qualified his resistance to a new dispatch, however,
							by stating that something must be found which would enable his President
							to face opponents of the new dispatch, adding that he had been
							disappointed by the American refusal thus far to “take initiative” in
							that sense. Locke replied that we, too, had exceeded what Congress
							expected in way of troops for Vietnam because no one could predict
							requirements, but that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had faced up to leadership problems in the
							matter.</p>
                        <p>The Defense Minister said that in addition to his opposition on grounds
							of security, he had been very disappointed by the American performance
							on March 4, 1966 undertakings, that whereas the Koreans had sent every
							man they had agreed to send, the Americans had not kept their
								promises.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>'s March 4, 1966, letter
								detailing the military and economic assistance extended to the
								Koreans in exchange for troops for Vietnam; for a draft, see <ref target="#d76">Document 76</ref>. Regarding the letter as sent,
								see <ref target="#d76fn9">footnote 9, Document 76</ref>. The Embassy
								issued periodic progress reports on the extent to which the United
								States had met its commitments relative to the 1966 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop deployment. (National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69,
								DEF 19 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-US, DEF 19 US–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>, and DEF 19–3 US–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> replied to this rather
							characteristic pitch in low key, (knowing Park fully aware of
							performance figures), and said we would endeavor to phrase future
							commitments in more precise terms. Locke assured the President that the
							U.S. is greatly concerned with maintenance of Korean security and
							economic welfare. He related our intentions re the Military Assistance
							Program in the coming year, support fund level, and the $10 million
							program loan.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then made a statement which related to his own
							success in turning off Assembly inquiry into the matter of
							implementation of the March 4, 1966, agreement. He also referred, as did
							the Defense Minister, to the “anti-infiltration measures commitment of
							$35 million” which, he said, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> indicated he had not received from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and would consider when he did.
							Rather than get into a bargaining session then and there, we indicated
							that this was a matter we could discuss later and perhaps General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> would have some
							comments on it when he returns. The Ministers' performance may have been
							intended to permit Park to assume a constructive role. If so, it was
							well designed for its purpose.</p>
                        <p>Before the discussion ended, Locke asked Park if we could set a date for
							discussion of the “arrangements” to support the “light division” he had
							mentioned. Park replied that <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and the Minister of Defense could arrange for a
							mutually convenient time to open conversations.</p>
                        <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0331"/>
                        <p>I recommend very careful handling of this matter. Park's problems will be
							greatly increased if the Assembly or the press learn of the foregoing,
							which they would surely interpret, Korean aid, as a commitment. This is
							a matter of real concern to me in view of local predilection for press
							leaks.</p>
                        <p>I will seek an appointment with the Defense Minister immediately after
							Ambassador Locke has an opportunity to discuss the matter in Washington
							and I have your comments.</p>
                        <p>Our arrangement with the President's staff about the press is that the
							meeting will be described as a general review of the Vietnam
							situation.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> visited me
							yesterday and provided a complete rundown on the situation in Korea.
							There is definite information that Kim Il Sung has embarked on a course
							of drastically increased conflict along lines proposed by Che Guevara.
							Based on the theory that the United States cannot support more than one
							“Vietnam” at a time, he hopes to create a situation that will prevent
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> from sending more troops to
							Vietnam, cripple the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy, cause
							the United States to withdraw, and eventually communize the country. A
							force of special agents, commandos, and guerrillas specialized for
							various locations in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, already
							averaging about 25,000 strong, is being trained and is already operating
							into <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Action has occurred throughout
							the country, at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and in
							mountainous regions in the Northeast and Southwest of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. The latter two are supported by sea
							infiltration, which constitutes over 60 percent of the total. To date
							there have been vastly increased attempted penetrations, firefight
							incidents, and UNC casualties, all up about tenfold from last year.</p>
                        <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0332"/>
                        <p>Later plans of Kim Il Sung include severe disruption of our <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>, cowing the population by terror, and
							placing U.S. installations under siege. He then might open the option of
							conventional air strike and ground attack a la Israel, assuming we would
							not use nuclear weapons. This is expected to heat up considerably by
							next summer.</p>
                        <p>To counter this threat, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> has organized a mixed line and mobile defense
							in depth along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and around the
							coasts. Although his resources are meager, he is strengthening
							anti-infiltration defenses at sea, along and behind the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d138fn2">Additional
								information concerning the barrier system along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> is in airgram A–297 from Seoul,

							U.S., on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. The United

                        <p>He has submitted, through <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to
								<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, a plan for modest inputs of
							added defensive equipment (cost, $40M) to augment his strength. This is
							designed not to detract from the Vietnam effort. He is confident he can
							turn back the attack, but believes he has barely enough resources to do
							so. We are skeptical that $40 million is enough even as a starter, but
							he is trying to keep his requirements minimal.</p>
                        <p>We discussed with him, and are examining, the various ways in which
							R&amp;D might help. A counterinfiltration system design effort is
							already underway in ARPA and the Services.</p>

                        <p>The President began by putting a series of questions to President Park
							about the morale of his troops; whether the Vietnamese were improving;
							and the quality of American support and leadership for the Korean
							forces.</p>
                        <p>Park said his own troops were in good spirits; felt that progress was
							being made; judged that the South Vietnamese were in fact improving; and
							felt that U.S. support and leadership for his forces were admirable.</p>
                        <p>The President then turned to the critical issue; namely, his judgment
							that we need more men quickly in South Vietnam. He described the
							movement of 10,000 U.S. forces and 600 tons of equipment in 17 days,
							ending Dec. 18. He said that Westmoreland would have 102 of his 106
							maneuver battalions by Christmas. We know that parts of 2 divisions are
							moving south. The President observed that he was glad Park was here
							today for the service for Harold Holt. Holt looked at things the way
							President Park and President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> did. There are now fewer of us and we must stick
							closer together.</p>
                        <p>Park thanked the President for sending extra food to help overcome the
							drought in South Korea. President said he was glad to do so and asked
							about the kimchi. The bureaucracy in Washington gave him more hell about
							the kimchi than it did about the war in Vietnam, but he managed to get
							it. Park said he was gratified the kimchi would arrive starting at the
							beginning of 1968. It would certainly lift the morale.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> explained that
							the problem of canning the kimchi had delayed arrival. It was being sent
							as fast as possible and the VC would never be able to hold the Koreans
							once it arrived.</p>
                        <p>President Park then asked President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> if he had received a report of Amb. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>'s talks about troops on the
							working level.<note n="2" xml:id="d140fn2">Not further
								identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President said that he had read the report with great pleasure; but
							he had expected Korea to respond to the need for additional forces. It
							had been the staunchest and most forthcoming of the allies.</p>
                        <p>President Park understood that if the U.S. were to get out of Asia, the
							Asian countries could not stand alone and would then wish they <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0335"/>had fought side by side with
							the U.S. If President Park hadn't done what he had in Vietnam, his job
							would have been unbearable.</p>
                        <p>President Park then explained his domestic situation with respect to the
							additional forces. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
							was working with his counterpart. He needed additional U.S. equipment
							because the pressure by the North Koreans had somewhat changed the
							attitude of South Koreans with respect to sending forces to South
							Vietnam. He had to be able to demonstrate to his Assembly that in
							sending additional forces to South Vietnam he was, simultaneously,
							getting equipment which would represent at least equivalent protection
							against North Korea. That is why the requests were focused on
							anti-infiltration and anti-espionage equipment. President Park repeated
							that he had to base his sending of additional forces to South Vietnam on
							the grounds that this would not detract and might increase South Korean
							security against North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President said we were working on Korean request now. Our <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program has been cut by a third in the
							Congress. Korea, Australia, and other allies must understand that if
							they don't put enough now into South Vietnam, the President may not be
							able to hold the line and then they will face a much more serious
							situation. President went on to say he would give urgent attention with
							view to favorable action on the Korean request. But he wanted Gen.
							Westmoreland to have the troops soon; and Park should start moving them
							on faith in the U.S. response. He said that <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>'s cable of his talks in Seoul<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">See <ref target="#d137">Document 137</ref>.</note>
							had come in just as he was leaving. He hoped for a full additional
							division from Korea. He would instruct that we get one destroyer to
							Korea to help as soon as possible. He would have his staff look into the
							possibility of a second destroyer. We would get the counter-infiltration
							equipment request by Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> there as fast as possible. Although <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> has been cut from $620 million to $400
							million, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> has
							ordered that the Korean level be maintained and cuts be taken
							elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> repeated that he
							would look next week into Korean requirements and let Park know as soon
							as possible. In the meanwhile, Park should bear in mind that in the
							movement of the troops, speed is of the essence.</p>
                        <p>President Park said he shared wholeheartedly President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s purpose, but, unlike
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, he must get an
							explicit authorization from his National Assembly before he can move his
							forces. At the moment, the National Assembly is filibustering on the
							budget. He could deal with the National Assembly easier if the U.S.
							commitment was firm.</p>
                        <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0336"/>
                        <p>President then asked what information does Korea need on U.S. aid?</p>
                        <p>Park said that he needed the equipment to strengthen his security against
							North Korea before probes along the 38th parallel were revived next
							spring when the snow was off the ground. He will send Korean forces, if
							possible, next March—in any case, before May, if the requested material
							is in Korea.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said that by
							January 1 Park will know the amounts and delivery dates of the equipment
							we can supply; but he wanted President Park to get his men there on
							March 1. President Park agreed to that deal.</p>
                        <p>President then went down the list: one destroyer in 10 months, but we
							shall try to do better than that. We shall also look into the matter of
							a second destroyer. Although <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds
							have been cut 30% there will be no cut in <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. Counter-infiltration equipment will be sent. Park will
							have a response after the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> review of
							his request in Seoul by January 1. But President Park will target March
							1 as the date for putting in his additional forces. Park said he would
							ask his Defense Minister how soon he could get his forces in and he
							replied April was the earliest possible.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> then said:
							That's why you've got Presidents: to make Defense Ministers work harder.
							It is a President's job to do the impossible. The possible is easy. It
							is the impossible that Presidents must deal with. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> recalled various examples of
							actions which were initially opposed by his ministers; for example, the
							kimchi; sending of patrol boats to Korea; and certain bombing operations
							in the North which he and President Park had discussed at Manila.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> said he would
							daresay that if President Park had listened to his Ministers, there
							would not now be Korean troops in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Park said, finally, if I have a reply by January 1 I shall see what we
							can do.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> repeated that we
							have got to get additional 100,000 forces to Gen. Westmoreland from
							U.S., Korea, Thailand, and South Vietnam. And he promised that Amb.
								<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> would deliver our
							response by January 1.</p>
                        <p>President Park then said he would do his utmost to speed up the arrival
							of the troops. He said that sometimes Korea could move faster than the
							U.S. when it made up its mind; and he would try his utmost to meet the
							target date.</p>

                        <p>1. A letter from you to President Park which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> would deliver personally on
							January 1.</p>
                        <p>2. Detailed instructions to <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
							which he would present to Park after Park has read your letter.</p>
                        <p>3. Instructions to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> on how to
							pay for this package of additional assistance. Also attached are the
							pertinent messages which give the background for the package we are
							recommending.</p>
                        <p>I believe it is a good package.</p>
                        <p>1. They ask for two destroyers: we are giving them one out of the Fleet
							Reserve for spring delivery and are reactivating another and will
							deliver it as early as possible. (Cost—$6 million not counting the value
							of the ships.)</p>
                        <p>2. They ask for three helicopter companies: We are giving them one for
							delivery in 1968, and this is difficult in view of helicopter shortage
							in Southeast Asia. (Cost—$3 million. In addition we have delivered 18
							helicopters to Korea in the last two months and all of these will be
							available for counter-infiltration service.)</p>
                        <p>3. With our military, the Koreans worked out a counter-infiltration
							counter-guerrilla plan which requires a great deal of new equipment. We
							are approving the plan and agreeing to provide the needed equipment.
							There may be some difficulty on delivery dates but we are undertaking to
							do our level best to deliver as much as possible by the spring.
							(Cost—$32 million.)</p>
                        <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0338"/>
                        <p>4. The Koreans want <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for 8
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> battalions for use in
							counter-infiltration activities: We are agreeing to use Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to support these units.</p>
                        <p>5. They ask for additional artillery: We are agreeing to provide one
							battalion of self-propeller 8-inch Howitzers for 1968 delivery. This is
							less than they ask for, but probably as much as they expected to get.
							(Cost—$3 million.)</p>
                        <p>6. They ask to set up a 5,000-man civilian logistics corps in Vietnam at
							highly advantageous pay scales: We are agreeing to the creation of the
							5,000-man corps and will negotiate the pay scale level. These civilians
							will replace Korean soldiers now on logistics duty. (Cost—an additional
							$5 to 20 million depending on the pay scale.)</p>
                        <p>7. They ask that we support their additional forces for Korea—a light
							division of 11,000 men along the same lines as their recent deployment:
							We are agreeing. (Cost—$62 million.)</p>
                        <p>We are not agreeing to:</p>
                        <p>1. Their request that we provide heavy equipment for the construction of
							a limited access divided multilane super highway from Seoul to
							Pusan.</p>
                        <p>2. Their request for one F 4C air squadron. We are agreeing to look into
							the possibility of using some Korean pilots in Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>They do, however, want some help with their domestic Parliamentary
							problems. The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister want to come to
							Washington to see you “for a few minutes,” preferably around the middle

							of the Vietnam situation. They want no conversations with any other
							officials and no official greetings or ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this trip is to move the Prime Minister and Defense
							Minister in the front of this problem so that Park can take the position
							that they have convinced him of the need for more troops in Vietnam. Put
							another way, it takes the emphasis off your conversations with Park in
							Australia and reduces the ability of the Parliamentary opposition to
							argue that Park jumps when you say “frog.”</p>
                        <p>State is against the visit (draft cable at Tab A).<note n="4" xml:id="d142fn4">None of the tabs is printed.</note> State thinks

                        <p>—would involve the President too directly in Korean domestic political
							squabbles;</p>
                        <p>—would make the dispatch of additional troops too directly a response to
							the U.S. President's wishes rather than the result of Korean
							determination to do its full share. I do not agree with State's
							position. 11,000 men are important to us, and if a brief interview helps

                        <p>I believe that such a visit would be put in a better light, however, if

							and thereupon were asked by Park to consult with you.</p>
                        <p>Although State seems not to be confident that the visit is Park's idea,
								<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> (Tab B, last

							a device to move the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defense
							to the forefront in coming Assembly consideration, and to permit Park
							himself to adopt a position of having been convinced of the need for
							more troops by the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Defense
							as a result of their Washington consultation.”</p>
                        <p>I think we should have Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> make certain that the visit is desired by

                        <p>On January 6, 1968, President Pak presided over an emergency conference
							on internal security at the Korean Army Headquarters at Wonju. In public
							statements President Pak announced that the conference would focus on
							combating an expected “tenfold increase in [North Korean] agent
							infiltration whose purpose is all out guerrilla warfare.” The President
							reportedly called the meeting to discuss counterinfiltration measures
							and to promote a new Civil Defense Bill scheduled for legislative
							consideration. Approximately 160 senior officials from the national and
							provincial governments, the military and police, and the Korean Central
							Intelligence Agency attended the well-publicized conference. (Telegram
							3308 from Seoul, January 9, National Archives and Records
							Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 KOR <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0341"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Embassy later reported that the
							meeting was intended to generate a high level of publicity “to impress
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> with readiness of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to deal with infiltrators and other
							subversive activities, to alert Korean people to seriousness of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> infiltration threat this spring, and to
							dramatize to Korean people preparedness of Pres. Park and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to protect security of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.” (Telegram 3447 from Seoul, January
							17; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>In addition to furthering those objectives, the Embassy reported that the
							government intended to use the Wonju meeting to “create public climate
							in favor of controversial Civil Defense Bill.” (Ibid., and telegram 3308
							from Seoul, January 9; ibid.) The Embassy advised that the pending bill
							was “almost unanimously condemned by press and academic groups for wide
							powers it gives govt. and consequent fears for individual rights.” The
							political opposition had voiced its intention to defeat the bill when it
							came before an upcoming special session of the National Assembly.
							(Telegram 3308 from Seoul, January 9; ibid.)</p>
                        <p>The conference produced a revised counterinfiltration plan establishing
							interagency control under the overall authority of provincial governors
							and the Prime Minister to meet specific threats. According to the Prime
							Minister, the program would advance Korean interests in “maintaining
							civilian control over counter-infiltration operations” and in “limiting
							use of troops and their contact with local population during
							operations.” (Telegram 3447 from Seoul, January 17; ibid.) In the days
							following the conference the Minister of National Defense outlined to
							the Korean press additional counterinfiltration measures, including
							creating new rapid-response teams and helicopter and patrol-boat units,
							installing new radar systems, as well as constructing a fence across and
							defoliating the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. (Telegrams 3350 and

                        <p>In the late evening hours of January 21, 1968, approximately 30
							well-trained and well-armed North Korean infiltrators perpetrated an
							attack on the Blue House, killing several South Koreans civilians and
							members of the Korean National Police. At least five North Koreans were
							killed by defensive gunfire, and at least two were captured and taken
							into custody. (Telegram 3532 from Seoul, January 22; National Archives
							and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) According to an excerpt of the interrogation of one of
							the infiltrators, the mission was to enter the Blue House, to kill the
							security forces encountered, “to chop off President Pak Chung Hee's <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0342"/>head and to shoot to death his
							key subordinates in that building.” (Telegram 3649 from Seoul, January
							26; ibid.) The United Nations Command responded by immediately calling
							for a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission to protest the
							action. That meeting was scheduled for January 23. (Telegram 3532 from
							Seoul, January 22; ibid.) Hostile encounters between North Koreans and
							combined United Nations and Republic of Korea forces continued for
							several days after the incident at points along the Demilitarized Zone.
							Documentation concerning those encounters is ibid.</p>
                        <p>Less than 48 hours after the raid on the Blue House, North Korean forces
							seized the U.S. intelligence-gathering vessel USS Pueblo on January 23
							and arrested its crew. The United States protested the incidents at the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council and met with
							North Korean representatives at the Military Armistice Commission in
							Panmunjom in an attempt to gain release of the ship and crew.
							Documentation focusing on the interaction between the United States and

                        <p>In addition to bringing both incidents before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council, the South Koreans requested that the
							United States and the 15 other military participants in the Korean War
							reaffirm their commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea as set
							forth in the 1953 Armistice Declaration. Although the United States
							willingly declared its commitment to the Republic of Korea, it opposed
							pressing the other nations to do so. The United States believed, since
							the international situation had changed during the intervening years,
							that a unanimous declaration of support reaffirming the Declaration was
							unlikely, undesirable, and could only demonstrate to the North Koreans
							and other Communist countries a deficiency in international support for
							positions advanced by the United States and Republic of Korea within the
							United Nations. (Telegram 113543 to Seoul, February 10; National
							Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69,
								<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–14 KOR/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) Subsequent discussions between the United States and
							the 15 countries demonstrated the general reluctance of those nations to
							reaffirm the Declaration. (Telegram 120026 to Seoul, February 23; ibid.)
							Although apprised of that situation, South Korean representatives
							continued to discuss their request with the countries in question.
							Although many were sympathetic to Korea's plight, few were prepared to
							satisfy South Korea's wish. Documentation detailing Korean efforts and
							U.S. responses to that request are ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US; <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. President Park reacted strongly to representations made to Prime
							Minister to effect that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
							avoid reprisals against North Koreans. He asked me to call this
							afternoon and kept me for hour and half. He opened with request for
							statement of position as I knew it, with emphasis on <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident. I recounted facts as they have been
							transmitted to us as well as attitude we took in MAC meeting this
							morning. I also told him of naval movements and said he could rely on us
							to remain in contact with him as this affair developed.<note n="3" xml:id="d145fn3">Documentation on the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meetings with the North Koreans and the movement of
								naval vessels into the region is in the compilation on the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crisis.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Park commented immediately on fact that we had asked North Korea for
							apology and immediate return of the ship. To this we should have added,
							he said, that we wanted assurance that there would be no more raiding of
							any kind into South Korean territory. I said UNC had asked for <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting because we wanted to get at
							North Koreans on subject of the raid, and the ship affair had developed
							later. He could be sure that raid would figure prominently in exchange
							at Panmunjom though we had no precise indication from <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government prior to my conversation
							with him as to what it desired. Park said that the problem would become
							acute when North Koreans say first, that there was no raid, that attack
							on Blue House in Seoul was simply a peoples' uprising; and second, when
							they reject our request for apology and refuse to return the ship. If we
							try to minimize the affair from then on, American prestige will fall
							greatly as matter has gone too far on both sides.</p>
                        <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0344"/>
                        <p>3. I said the matter has to be considered very carefully and that we must
							think about rather than react immediately to the enemy's initiatives.
							The enemy had taken these actions at times and in places of his own
							choosing. He was not undoubtedly in an alert posture, and there were
							many reasons why we should not accommodate him. It was this which led us
							to make representations to the Prime Minister this morning on subject of
							reprisals.</p>
                        <p>4. Park said vehemently that we seemed to be more worried about reprisals
							by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government than we are about
							getting satisfaction out of North Koreans. He said he respects the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command and the wishes of the
							American ally and he will not undertake unilateral reprisals at this
							point. He wanted to make it very clear, however, that retaliation will
							become inevitable if there are any more attacks by the North on South
							Korea. He said objective of the raid was to kill the President and his
							family and they had very nearly succeeded. He knows that there are 2400
							additional men in North Korea with similar training and purpose. These
							men have been taken from North Korean Army and given special training.
							They are located in six centers and he would like to strike them and
							eliminate entire unit in one blow. He said he is convinced that this
							will have to be done sooner or later or they will come down here again
							and again, striking at many different targets.</p>
                        <p>5. Park said that if United States gets no satisfaction in matter of the
							Pueblo we should strike North Korean naval ships along east coast after
							first neutralizing North Korean air power. The South Korean Government
							would be glad to cooperate in such a venture.</p>
                        <p>6. When he paused I said his friend President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> would be pleased to have his assurance that
							there would be no unilateral action against the North by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. I said we understand that
							he has been subjected to great provocation but that he would be measured
							in United States and everywhere else throughout the non-Communist world
							by restraint he shows in these difficult circumstances. He repeated
							again his view that we are going to have to do something because of the
							attitude we have taken in demanding apology and immediate return of the
							ship, and he wants added to that in any way we can get it across that
							there must also be assurance to the South Korean Government that there
							will be no more forays from the North. He is convinced that if we have
							to act against North Korea, Chinese internal troubles will keep them
							from moving provided they are given assurance that there will be no
							threat to their territorial integrity.</p>
                        <p>7. Meeting terminated on note of reiteration that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government would engage in no unilateral reprisals in
							connection with this incident. I assured him that we would consult fully
							with him as developments occur.</p>
                        <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0345"/>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I think we have what we want from him
							in the way of assurance, but if there is another incident all bets are
							off. I suggest you consider brief message from President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to Park admiring his restraint
							and statesmanship and assuring him of close cooperation and
							consultation.</p>

							(U).</p>
                        <p>1. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) This is an attempt by me to draw
							some conclusions regarding North Korean posture from events of last few
							days.</p>
                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) First conclusion is that these
							events, the strident outpourings of propaganda from Pyongyang echoed
							from Moscow, and North Korean statements at today's Armistice Commission
							meeting all tend to confirm previous reports from this headquarters that
							North Koreans intend to wage in earnest an advanced version of “porous
							warfare” combining unconventional warfare, continuously reiterated
							propaganda themes, psychological warfare and subversion and sabotage.
							The pattern seems clearly to indicate that Kim Il-Sung is a determined
							practitioner of the concepts advanced by Che Guevara in his article on
							“Many Vietnams” published 12 August 1967 in the Tricontinental, a
							publication of the Havana-based “Afro-Asia-Latin American People's
							Solidarity Organization.” There are also additional evidences that he
							still suffers from belief that U.S. military effort so extended in
							support of Vietnam that U.S. unable adequately assist <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, except perhaps by nuclear weapons
							which he seems to believe would not be used in current context of
							dissidence and antiwar feeling in U.S.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Blue House raid on night of
							20–21 January confirmed in accurate detail the previous intelligence
							reported from here that <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314" facs="0346"/>North
							Koreans had trained and developed “30 man suicide teams.” Information
							obtained from the one agent captured indicates 2400 men in special units
							had been under arduous training for two years and that later raids may
							be undertaken by teams of company size. Credibility this sole captive
							not corroborated from other sources established but he has provided much
							information and retraced on the ground the infiltration route of his
							team with confirmatory external evidence.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Current propaganda blasts adhere
							strictly to same basic themes reported from here over past year.
							Essentially the two themes are: (a) U.S. imperialists with <persName corresp="#p_PC1">Park Chung Hee puppets</persName> are aggressors
							vying to provoke new Korean War and (b) subversive and guerrilla raids
							south of <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> are manifestations of
							revolutionary South Korean patriots and not conducted by North
							Koreans.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Continuing evidence crop up in both
							North Korean actions and statements that Kim Il-Sung may be suffering
							from serious miscalculation as to U.S. capacity to react in Korea at
							same time war continues in Vietnam. This contains seeds of real danger
							if credibility of U.S. deterrent against overt action remains in
							doubt.</p>
                        <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Our estimate of North Korean
							capabilities and effectiveness of their “porous war” tactics is
							undergoing continuing reevaluation and we attribute even high
							capabilities now than previously given them. I am considering at the
							moment employing another battalion plus from the 7th U.S. division to
							reinforce local defense capabilities of Nike/Herc sites and special
							weapons storage areas. There have been today numerous fire fights and
							sightings of smaller agent groups in I Corp area north of Seoul,
							probably remnants of the original Blue House raiding team. A number of
							casualties have been suffered by both sides. We anticipate increasing
							team infiltrations in near future to include agent boat landings. In
							this connection, in my discussion with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> this morning I found him seriously
							concerned at what he called his “underestimation” of numbers and
							effectiveness of well-trained North Korean teams. He wishes to present
							to UNC/<gloss target="#t_USFK1">USFK</gloss> in near future plan for
							rotating mobilizations within rear area security divisions to provide
							16,000 men for coast watching and associated counter- landing
							operations. Will report later on this when concept clearer.</p>
                        <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In summary, I believe North Korean
							pattern of operations is proceeding along lines previously predicted in
							numerous messages from here and as briefed in Washington at army
							commander's conference, <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>, etc. My
							concern, however, is that while some of our predictions have seemed “far
							out” the North Korean actions have exceeded them and at higher
							tempo.</p>
                        <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The original North Korean objectives
							of: (a) diverting efforts from Vietnam, (b) harassing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economic development, and (c) the
							underlying theme regularly stated by Kim Il-Sung of encouraging South
								<pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0347"/>Korean revolutionaries and
							achieving unification—on Communist terms—before or in early 70's seem to
							be making headway, at least with respect to the first two
							objectives.</p>
                        <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In light of above, recommend
							expeditious decision regarding some augmentation U.S. Eighth Army,
							particularly for local security reinforcements. We are also reviewing
							sea infiltration threat and may soon recommend that to extent feasible
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Navy and Air Force resources
							involved be further supported by additional U.S. Navy sea surveillance
							flights and possibly assistance of two U.S. destroyers.</p>

                        <p>2. I met with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> this morning (270200Z). I started
							out by saying now it more important than ever that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US military work closely together
							with mutual trust and confidence. One objective Communist actions is to
							disrupt excellent US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations. I
							then updated them, on broad basis, of US actions within bounds of
							cautions contained in numerous incoming action messages. I had not
							received guidance regarding informing them on drone flight<note n="2" xml:id="d148fn2">Flights over North Korea were authorized to gather
								information on the whereabouts of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
								and its crew.</note> by time of meeting so excluded same.</p>
                        <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>3. Important points made by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s were as
							follows: First, need for them to be adequately and timely informed on US
							intentions because they affect their mobilization planning, national
							emergency planning, martial law plans and numerous other vital plans
							conducted by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government.</p>
                        <p>4. Second point was expression of strong feeling at all levels of the
							republic, that US at our governmental level had taken no adequately
							drastic action following attempt attack on President and Blue House.
							However, seizure <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> we had reacted
							drastically. They all expressed views along this line, making plain
							their object was not obstructive but that they were speaking as real
							friends of the US in whom they have great faith and trust. They
							reiterated nevertheless that actions taken by US in and from Korea
							should stress point that we view attack on Blue House—“The national
							symbol of the republic”—equally as important as <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. They said mere oral protestation to this effect would
							not correct Korean opinion but that we should take immediate, tangible
							steps such as “air lifting immediately into Korea increments of <gloss target="#t_CIGCOREP1">CIGCOREP</gloss> equipment,” make firm
							announcement of commitment to deliver destroyers and other actions which
							can be taken within days.</p>
                        <p>5. The third point was expressed by all in one way or another. This is
							importance of taking clear, punitive action to teach Kim Il-Sung a
							lesson. Defensive action only within <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							alone would, they said, insure continuation and increase in North Korean
							infiltration and raids up to 10 or 100 times current levels. Several
							expressed concern that US would mount massive effort until <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew returned but then would not
							continue to press to insure the stop of North Korean subversive war,
							they feared build-up and carrier task force would be retracted from
							Korea and vicinity when <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident settled.
							This, they said, would have grave effect of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/US relations and only encourage Communists. I attempted
							allay their fears and pointed out none of resources which might be
							directed to Korea were being supplied from Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. All the chiefs seemed deeply to appreciate the meeting and their
							expressions above were obviously sincere and well-meaning. They
							unquestionably need more information on basic US intentions with regard
							both <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident and Kim Il-Sung's subversive
							war activities. None seemed alarmed over imminence North Korea would
							take overt large-scale aggressive action unless these develop as result
							continuing actions.</p>
                        <p>7. I would like to operate on basis of informing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on close-hold basis of all intended
							moves we plan to make except those in which message traffic explicitly
							prohibits discussion with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. I will
							proceed on this basis unless I hear to contrary.</p>
                        <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0350"/>
                        <p>8. I wish to emphasize, from other sources as well as <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, that concern lest US reaction is
							only in regard to <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> is widespread and
							serious in many circles of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government and public. I concur in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							statement at end para 4 above and recommend feasible action to this
							end.</p>

                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> has asked
								<gloss target="#t_CINCUSARPAC1">CINCUSARPAC</gloss> for an increase
							of 5161 in the U.S. Army Korea ceiling. His message of January 21<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">Not further identified but summarized

                        <p>b. “To improve and maintain a credible deterrent posture to cope with the
							enemy's increasing improvement in conventional war capability.”</p>
                        <p>2. On January 25 the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>

                            <hi rend="italic">Note:</hi> Their calculations are wrong, as will be

                        <p>3. On January 29 the Secretary of the Army<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">Not further identified.</note> presented four alternatives to you
							for increasing strength in Korea, ranging from 5,200 to 18,500. The
							first coincides with General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>'s request. The others are based on the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> “manning level increase” concept. The
							Secretary <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0351"/>of the Army
							recommended that any increase approved for Korea be matched by an
							increase in Army end-strength.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comments</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">“Manning Level” Increases</hi>. (Please see the
							attached chart.)<note n="5" xml:id="d149fn5">None of the attachments is
								printed.</note> Keying a Korean augmentation to an increase in
							manning level of the aggregated TO/TD structure spaces is not sound.
							Last year we thought we had about 65,000 TO/TD in Korea. As the result
							of the Army's efforts to account for all of its TO/TD structure, about
							6,000 more TO/TD structure spaces have been found in Korea. (This did
							not result in an increase in the total structure for which we are buying
							equipment. Compensating reductions were made elsewhere to assure
							consistency with our division force planning factor and the <gloss target="#t_DPM1">DPM</gloss> control figures.) The Army commander in
							Korea is probably not even aware of the total TO/TD strength which he
							has. He simply uses the people he has and makes adjustments in his force
							structure to maintain his principal combat units at a reasonable manning
							level. Some low priority structure is undoubtedly “deactivated” or kept
							at very low manning, perhaps even cadre status.</p>
                        <p>The sensible questions to ask here are: (1) What are the jobs that the
							Army in Korea must do that it's not doing now? and (2) How many more
							people (if any) does it take to do them? To answer these questions
							requires a careful audit of the status of each unit and a description of
							its job. Manning level increases might be justified on an individual
							unit basis, but certainly not across the board.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Army End-Strength Increases</hi>. There are several
							points to be noted.</p>
                        <p>a. We don't know how much the transient population can be reduced from
							current Army projections through control of leave taken during PCS
							moves. There are different levels possible, depending on the degree of
							national emergency and the inconvenience to which we are willing to
							subject personnel.</p>
                        <p>b. We believe that the training establishment is larger than necessary,
							but we don't know how much.</p>
                        <p>c. An increase in end strength would not help to provide an immediate
							augmentation in Korea, owing to the lead time in generating trained
							strength. However, steps that could be taken are: (1) an arbitrary
							contraction of the transient population; (2) extension of tours in Korea
							(4,000 men leave there each month); and (3) diversion of planned <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> deployments temporarily to Korea.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Whether to Increase Korea</hi>. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> says that the enemy is
							getting stronger and is planning to step-up infiltration and sabotage.
							He says nothing about how much the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Army has improved. It seems inconceivable that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s can't take care of themselves, at <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0352"/>least against the North
							Koreans. It also seems inconceivable that 52,000 U.S. troops can't
							protect themselves and their equipment.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations</p>
                        <p>There are two courses of action: (1) deny the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> request on the assumption that the U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces now in Korea should be able to
							handle the situation; (2) defer the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
							request pending their analysis of the force structure and presentation

                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> supported the
								second option and notified the appropriate military officials of his
								decision in a February 1 memorandum. The JCS submitted their

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Principal item discussed by President Park during my call on him (at
							his request) yesterday evening was along lines previously conveyed <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0353"/>to you, i.e. their pessimistic
							view of likelihood that they, and perhaps U.S. as well, will get no
							satisfaction from North Koreans. This time, however, something new was
							added: He said that if <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> does not
							get guarantee that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s will desist from
							their aggressive activities, and there is another incident, <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will take retaliatory measures.</p>
                        <p>2. Park said he knew that the Communist side is hoping to bring about a
							split between US–<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> cooperation, and
							that uncoordinated measures would make American Congress and people
							unhappy, but basic fact of matter is that unless and until North Koreans
							are hit sharply they will continue to create disturbed conditions and
							kill his people.</p>
                        <p>3. I said he knows my government is taking many steps to strengthen the
							position here. Whatever circumstances may prevail, and regardless of
							very real provocation to which <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has
							been and may yet be subjected, we are counting on full and complete
							consultation with him and his government prior to any action they might
							be considering. This was what we had been careful to do with them in the
							present crisis and we expect no less from them. The seriousness of
							uncoordinated action lay in fact that it would undermine mutual
							confidence and its bad effects could outlast that of any particular
							incident. (President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s
							statement on Park to press yesterday just received. It is most useful at
							this point and is being taken to Park immediately.)<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">These comments were made during a news conference
								on February 2. (<hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of
									the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1968–69</hi>, Book I, pp.
								155–163.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Park said he did not mean to impart doubt of his closest ally in any
							way, but he does have worries as to the position <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will be in, particularly if <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew returned and North Koreans
							continue their raids on the South. I reminded him of statement I had
							made to him (which was based on para six of reftel), <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s will clearly understand that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew are not end of problem and that
							we will remain equally concerned about gravity of armistice violations.
							I said I hoped his army had been instructed to avoid incidents along
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. He said that army has strict
							instructions in that sense and that we have his assurance that there
							will be no <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> unilateral action in
							present circumstances. The remarks he had just made apply to the future
							position, I said I had made our position as clear as I possibly
							could.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This exchange was very firm, but
							without heat. He was telling me and I was telling him. His remarks
							reflect hard line of many of his ministers, party elements and the
							generals. We are the counterweight to the type of pressure they are
							exerting. I expect our views will continue to prevail unless there is
							another severe raid though there is always danger that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> unit will make unauthorized thrust
							across <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. There may be a certain
							amount of bad humor and discontent <pb n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0354"/>here later, but that should pass as we implement <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and other programs already under

							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to President
							Park:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin text:</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. President: The attempt to assassinate you and your family and
							our Ambassador is the latest and most shocking act against your country
							by the North Korean communists. I thank God that this unspeakable
							attempt has failed.</p>
                        <p>That the leaders in Pyongyang would order such a desperate measure shows
							their awareness of what your courageous leadership has meant to your
							country. I doubt that their failure will bring any respite in their
							efforts to introduce armed agents into your Republic, and to cause as
							much trouble as possible.</p>
                        <p>These attacks on your country have greatly increased during the past
							year, and you and I have done a lot to improve your ability to deal with
							them. I know you have given much thought to new ways in which this
							infiltration can best be met, and I, too, have been thinking of more
							ways to help you. Several of my top advisors have been working on this
							matter with even greater urgency than before, and I hope to be able to
							share our specific ideas with you at an early date.</p>
                        <p>I want you to know that we are urgently considering how to strengthen the
							equipment of your forces to meet this increased campaign from the North.
							I am giving this my personal attention and expect to be in touch with
							you soon about this matter.</p>
                        <p>You have been kept fully informed of the details of the recent seizure by
							the North Koreans of our naval ship, the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>,
							and its crew. I know you share our concern. We shall continue to press
							hard <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0355"/>for the earliest possible
							release of these men and their vessel. If progress toward this end is
							not soon forthcoming, we shall have to consider what additional measures
							will be necessary and appropriate.</p>
                        <p>I have no doubt that the increased incidents along the Demilitarized
							Zone, the seizure of our ship and the recent effort to attack you, are
							part of North Korea's program to create maximum tension in the area.
							They may hope, thereby, to help their friends in Hanoi. They may think
							that by raising tension in Korea they can force us to divert our
							attention from the campaign of aggression against South Viet-Nam. They
							will not succeed in that effort. The movements of planes and ships to
							the Republic of Korea in these last days have been from our active
							forces in the United States and in the Pacific. None has been taken from
							Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>The events of this past week in Viet-Nam have demonstrated anew how
							important it is for us all to remain strong there and to stand fast. I
							have no doubt we shall continue to do so. And we shall continue to stand
							strong and together in your country against any efforts, however
							desperate, by the regime in the North.</p>
                        <p>Our mutual objectives of peace, security and progress in Asia require us
							to make it entirely clear to the men in Pyongyang and in Hanoi that
							terror and lawlessness will not succeed and that their diversionary
							tactics will have no effect.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly grateful that we have been able to keep in such close
							contact through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, who has been able to keep me current with your
							views. In these difficult days for both our countries, it is good to be
							able to share one's thoughts with a trusted friend and ally. Sincerely,
							Lyndon B. Johnson </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. President Park was clearly moved by message contained <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>. I have not seen him affected in
							this way before now and he made no effort to hide his feelings as he
							heard President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s
							solicitude for him and his family, lengthy discussion of mutual problems
							and finally the warm reference to him as trusted friend and ally. One
							may occasionally make him smile and even laugh, but it is a very rare
							thing to see his emotions stirred as they were by the President's
							message.</p>
                        <p>2. He kept me for almost two hours, during which I took occasion to brief
							him on the US/<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> meeting this
								morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3">Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>, representing the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command, and General Pak, head of the
								North Korean delegation, met in closed meetings at the Military
								Armistice Commission to discuss issues relative to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the release of its crew.</note> He
							was greatly interested in fact that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							rep put questions to US concerning augmentation of our air and naval
							forces, and troop alert. He said this another indication of their
							preoccupation with strength and their need to ascertain whether it might
							be used against them. He feels they will probe to determine our
							intentions and if and when they believe we have additional measures in
							mind, they will meet our demands for return of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew. They will not alter their policy of
							deliberate humiliation of US, he said, if they do not sense
							determination on our side.</p>
                        <p>3. He asked me what I thought. I said it looked to me as though the
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s may be approaching something like
							the North Vietnamese “you-stop-the-bombing-and-we'll-talk” ploy. In
							their case the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s may tell us
								“you-withdraw-your-naval-and-air-strength-from-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-
							and-we'll-talk-about-your-ship-and-crew.” In neither case, of course,
							was there much prospect of anything substantial. I said this was my
							off-the-cuff reaction and was not an official estimate, as I had not yet
							heard from you on the subject.</p>
                        <p>4. Park said we must be careful, that they had proved time and again that
							they cannot be trusted. Humiliation of the US is their goal, he said,
							and “your prestige is <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> prestige.”</p>
                        <p>5. He then took up matter of public opinion, and the National Assembly
							view of the situation, all of this along lines known to you, <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0357"/>but with certain ideas added. He
							remarked that the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>/US private meetings
							are stirring up adverse comment here and expressed a preference (I would
							not say it was stronger than that) for future meetings in public, or, if
							closed meetings continue to be necessary, a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> representative should be present. Public meetings, or
							closed meetings with a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officer
							present, would do much to reassure the public. Fact of matter, he said,
							is that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> side of problem, i.e. <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> violations and raids by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>, not being discussed in any forum at
							present.</p>
                        <p>6. I said that he knew we deeply appreciated his patience in all these
							matters, and his concurrence in meetings we found it desirable to have.
							He can see key position occupied by men of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							in this problem and his understanding of that enabled us to sound out
							the adversary when other channels had failed. It is sometimes necessary,
							I went on, for Presidents to withhold information temporarily in the
							public interest, to face press and public criticism while they are doing
							so, and this seemed to be one such case. I would of course transmit his
							comments and, as he knew, they would command attention at our highest
							levels.</p>
                        <p>7. I said I would comment now, however, on the matter of a public <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting. These usually turn into
							propaganda displays and as such cause important matters to be drawn out
							for weeks and months longer than might be necessary were they dealt with
							in closed session. True, as he said, the correspondents could be present
							and could at least publicize our statements. Trouble is, they usually
							give as much time and space to the propaganda of the adversary and we
							end up no better off. I would sound out my people on this general
							subject and would come back to him. (See comment below on advisability
							of trying to set up open <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting to
							discuss <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> violations only.)</p>
                        <p>8. I did not comment on suggestion that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might be present at closed meetings. We are likely to
							make more progress with <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s if there is
							no <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> presence at these meetings.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Please give me your views on
							desirability of another open <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting
							on <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> violations only. It is possible
							that such a meeting would evoke <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							riposte with <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> statement, but also possible,
							if we made no mention of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, that they would
							take that as indication we wish continue private talks with them on that
							subject. What I am trying to do is find device which will meet Park's
							public opinion (Assembly, party, intellectuals, military) problem here
							without interfering with our <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> contact
							on <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>10. It would also help us greatly if you could arrange early delivery to
							Kimpo Airport by largest airplanes available of substantial amount of
							counterinsurgency items already promised <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, if they are presently available. We would take care to
							have adequate presence of elements mentioned above, as well as all
							elements of local and foreign press. <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0358"/>This kind of thing, if properly handled, might also aid
							us in our palaver with the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s. Please
							comment soonest on this possibility.</p>
                        <p>11. The excellent support you have given me has made all the difference
							at this end.</p>

							personnel. In total, the Air Staff estimates that approximately 9000 Air

							$150 million depending on the extent, density, and sophistication of the

                        <p>3. Improve roads, railroads and other lines of communication, and
							munitions and material depots in South Korea ($50 million could be

                        <p>4. Reduce vulnerability of aircraft and airbases in Korea (shelter 180
							U.S. and 180 Korean aircraft for $50 million).</p>
                        <p>5. Give South Korea 25–50 F–4 fighters for air defense at a cost of
							$75–150 million.</p>
                        <p>6. Deploy 5,000 U.S. soldiers in addition to the approximately 520,000
							Korean and 50,000 U.S. soldiers there now.</p>
                        <p>7. Increase ammunition immediately available to land and air forces in

                        <p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I received an advance copy of your letter of February 3<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note>
							through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
							yesterday and I thank you sincerely for your keeping me informed of your
							views through your Ambassador here.</p>
                        <p>The recent seizure by the north Korea of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the infiltration of the armed Communist raiders
							into Seoul have demonstrated to the world anew the aggressiveness and
							lawlessness of the Communists. These acts have also arisen a serious
							problem to our prestige and a grave threat to our security.</p>
                        <p>I would like to take this opportunity to extend once again my expressions
							of sincere sympathy to Your Excellency, the people of the United States
							and the families of the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Also, I would like to express my great admiration and deep respect for
							your perseverance shown in seeking diplomatic solution to the problem
							and for your resolute determination as evident in your outright action
							taken in the movements of the United States forces.</p>
                        <p>I am very grateful that you are urgently considering measures to
							strengthen the defense capabilities of the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>In the wake of these incidents, we have made our views known to each
							other through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>.</p>
                        <p>And I quite agree with you that our two countries, at these difficult
							hours, should stand in closer unity and deal with the situation with
							concerted might. The traditional friendship between our two countries
							and the unchangeable, particular relations between our two peoples
							should bid us to do so.</p>
                        <p>What we should do first will be to have the vessel and the crew back and
							to seek a guarantee that the north Koreans cease their aggressive acts
							against the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0362"/>
                        <p>These, if devoid of one of the two, will not be complete in attaining our
							common goal.</p>
                        <p>How long our efforts for peaceful and diplomatic settlement should be
							kept going will, as you have pointed out, be our problem.</p>
                        <p>However, I sincerely hope that you understand my conviction that the
							problems should be solved by all means before the public opinions of the
							world which have stood with us may cool down.</p>
                        <p>It has been fifteen years since the Armistice Agreement was concluded and
							during this span of time, the north Koreans have constantly threatened
							us, their violation of the Agreement totalling some 5,000 cases. The
							threat has become even more serious during the past sixteen months,
							culminating in the aggressive intrusion into Seoul on January 21.</p>
                        <p>I should mention that in dealing with the Communists, indefinite efforts
							for peaceful solution will only bring advantages to them rather than to
							us. I can say through our own experiences that the Communists should be
							taught a lesson that any aggressive action cannot escape due punitive
							action.</p>
                        <p>If we had taken any punitive action whenever the north Koreans violated
							the Armistice Agreement in the past, we could have forestalled the
							situation which has ensued on these breaches.</p>
                        <p>In other words, I think the situation which we are facing today has
							resulted from our inaction to meet effectively the violation of the
							Agreement by the north Koreans.</p>
                        <p>To the north Koreans, therefore, we should show our resolute stand and
							determination that they cannot commit an aggressive act free of
							punishment. It should be remembered this alone will provide a corrective
							measure for the habitual aggressiveness of the north Koreans.</p>
                        <p>I have already made my views known to you on the secret negotiations
							between the United States and north Korea through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and I am not repeating them
							here.</p>
                        <p>Please accept, Your Excellency, my best wishes for a full measure of
							success in your endeavors.</p>
                        <p>With my kindest personal regards,</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>4008. 1. <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> and I were
							called to meet with Prime Minister, Ministers of Foreign Affairs,
							Defense, Information and Chief of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
							this morning. Meeting lasted approximately one hour twenty minutes.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> opened by saying he wanted
							to make clear the attitude of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government, that this was the time to think calmly and consider all the
							facts. At present time feelings of population quite different from
							periods of normalization of relations with Japan or when troops for
							Vietnam matter being considered. The government had adopted a cautious
							attitude to avoid helping the enemy or exciting the people. They had let
							no one know meeting with US being held. (When we arrived there were at
							least 100 correspondents in anteroom outside <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s office.)</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said closed or secret
							meetings at Panmunjom have been taking place. He is aware that
							Ambassador has been reporting to President Park on all these matters.
							Public understanding, however, was lacking. People believed that United
							Nations would continue to protect sovereignty and security of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> had
							sent raiders trying to overthrow <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government. Nevertheless meetings were going on between United States
							and North Korea at Panmunjom which is <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory. Is it reasonable that talks should be held
							in such a place between US and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>?
							Parties must abide by agreements where international law is
							nonexistent.</p>
                        <p>4. There had been innumerable violations by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> and only <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is abiding
							by international agreements, as all the world knows. But <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has no means of retaliation because
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command ties <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government's hands and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops cannot retaliate. This is far
							from ideal situation, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
							said.</p>
                        <p>5. Meetings between US and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> create
							public suspicion. Public feels that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							sovereignty is being discussed without <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s presence. So far the government has been quiet in
							order not to arouse public on this score. If Cuba raided Washington and
							attacked White House and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> then began
							separate talks with Cuba, what would be the US attitude in such
							circumstances?</p>
                        <p>6. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> got
							permission of President Park for the talks and has reported regularly to
							the President on them. President's agreement was only in principle for
							humanitarian purposes, and even <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0364"/>though President consented in principle, close cooperation is
							necessary. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> would like to make
							recommendations.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName>Chong</persName> then said that if one or two more closed
							meetings are necessary US should try to include <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> representatives, even though <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is not signatory to Armistice Agreement. There should
							at least be consultation with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							representative after which US representative should act accordingly. If
							secret meetings continue and suspicion continues that matters pertaining
							to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> sovereignty are discussed, there
							will be complications in our relationships. Ambassador and General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> should be
							reporting in strongest possible terms of real feelings of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public. Any Korean questioned about
							meetings at Panmunjom will give one answer only and it will be against
							such negotiations. Instead of closed or secret meetings <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government feels open meeting should be
							held. It is true that both sides would be militant in such meetings but
							people would know what was happening. They support their government in
							this most critical problem since the armistice. Even if closed meetings
							succeed in bringing about return of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and
							crew, there may be bad after effect. Much ill feeling had been created
							by division of the country years ago and current US talks with <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> touching on sovereignty of the country
							make it impossible to predict how <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							people will react. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> wanted to
							be frank about all this. If US is forced to bow to North Korea to save
							our soldiers, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> would continue to try to
							decrease US influence and prestige.</p>
                        <p>8. United Nations has condemned <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> continued, and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces are here to act as police men, but
							if they fail to do job, what will be result? <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was not saying that there should be closed or open
							meetings or that joint meetings should not go on. The government's
							preference was for open meeting but if it essential to have closed
							meetings they should be in cooperation with ROK representatives. Topics
							of discussion should not be limited to <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> but
							also to raid on Blue House which happened prior to <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and should be given priority in discussion. President
							Park has asked about guarantees for the future. Americans should know
							that if President had not given order against it, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would have retaliated on limited
							basis. If North Koreans had succeeded in hitting Blue House there would
							have been all-out war. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> operational
							control is for purpose of protecting <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							security. If <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> remains passive, PriMin
							asked, is this the wisest course? All <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Ministers present had strong impulse after raid to bomb
							Kim Il-Sung where he stood. Without guarantee of security should the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s simply try to prolong their
							existence or face up to a showdown? They have considered this more
							seriously than anyone else. If there is another incident should they
							stand still?</p>
                        <p>9. Considering relationships between US [and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>?] basic policy remained unchanged. If there is another
							incident, however, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will have to act.
							They are preparing limited retaliation measures.</p>
                        <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0365"/>
                        <p>10. I then replied by saying that we will discuss carefully with our
							people ideas which <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> put forth
							concerning meetings at Panmunjom and I would hope to come back to him
							with some comment on them in near future. He was entirely correct in
							saying that I have reported fully both in advance and after the fact on
							the meetings. I recognize that because of unusual aspects of this
							problem the ministers are having a difficult time with Assembly and the
							press, and we are searching for ways to help them. However, it was not
							within my authority to carry on ordinary type discussions, though I wish
							to be of help and do everything I could to ease the ministers'
							situation. With regard to feeling that only <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> has been discussed at the meetings, this is not
							correct. As recently as yesterday we had mentioned first aggressive
							North Korean actions against the Republic of Korea as being responsible
							for situation that had been created.</p>
                        <p>11. Finally, in my comment, I said that we recognize that they are under
							great provocation. We have expressed complete solidarity with them in
							current situation. Regardless of nature of any provocation which they
							may yet experience, I wanted to make it clear that we expect complete
							consultation in advance of any action they may contemplate. This is what
							we had given and this is what we expect. The adverse effect of
							uncoordinated action could far outlast that of any incident and it is
							absolutely necessary for us to remain in full consultation regardless of
							type of provocation to which they might be subjected.</p>
                        <p>12. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then said that two weeks
							have passed since raid on Seoul. Because of their dependence and trust
							he would request General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> to take up protection of the country. However,
							it looked to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that US is so
							involved with <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> as not to be concerned with
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security.</p>
                        <p>13. Gen <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> recounted at
							length (see <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>'s
							message KRA 0451 to <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> and
								<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>)<note n="2" xml:id="d156fn2">In KRA 0451, February 6, <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> reported that the

							measures taken by UNC in cooperation with Ministry of Defense against
							infiltration and to protect country. There are many matters under
							consideration he said which would reassure them although it is still
							premature to get into detail until they fully considered. Bonesteel also
							laid great emphasis on requirement for complete consultation with us on
							their plans and intentions.</p>
                        <p>14. Foreign Minister then made brief statement to effect problem is to
							avoid public suspicion of what is going on, that open meetings <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0366"/>at Panmunjom were the answer.
							Until now he did not know that there was any discussion of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> violations of Armistice and public
							believes there is none. I commented that in addition to assurance I had
							just given him that matter was mentioned yesterday at Panmunjom by US,
							there was substantial history of our statements giving proper emphasis
							to raid on Seoul and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> violation of
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, which if properly used in
							dealing with public and Assembly would do much to correct impressions
							and allay suspicions he mentioned. I cited statements in US, President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s statement on
							television on this subject, and said there was much additional material
							if they would but use it.</p>
                        <p>15. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then said they would say to
							press and Assembly only that meeting had been held and that they had
							made their viewpoint clear to us. We then adjourned from this “secret
							meeting” and departed through most disorderly press gathering I have
							seen here, which is saying a lot.</p>
                        <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Meeting was of course stated in part
							to show Assembly, press and military that government telling us the
							score. Despite threats of unilateral retaliatory action it does not
							change my opinion that at this point Park and closest advisors, despite
							their natural inclination, recognize need to restrain hotheads, among
							whom I include <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>. They have permitted,
							and probably encouraged, some turbulence in Assembly and among public,
							however, which may sweep them along toward retaliatory action if another
							incident occurs. Underlying fact that they have not used material we
							have provided to save their face in connection with Panmunjom meetings
							is, we believe, deep down feeling that this may be moment to reunify the
							country and that if opportunity is lost, it may not come again.
							President Park's personal regard for President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, restraints we have built into
							system of command control here, as well as those we are exerting
							currently, have thus far paid off, but at this point <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s need carefully watching.</p>
                        <p>17. Within day or two, or sooner, depending on how matters develop, I may
							give you some comment concerning desirability of special envoy.</p>

                        <p>110828. Personal and Eyes Only for the Ambassador from the Secretary. As
							one who has been intimately involved with Korea since the drafting of
							Japanese surrender terms, I am deeply disturbed by the present
							atmosphere of our relations. I know that we are dealing with an
							especially sensitive people, sometimes called the “Irish of the Far
							East.” I also am aware of other moments of tension even worse than the
							one we have today, particularly when I think back to the Syngman Rhee
							period. I think I understand fully the genuine concerns of the South
							Koreans even though I get impatient about their super sensitivity.</p>
                        <p>The one thing which is not tolerable back here is their suspicion about
							our basic motives and purposes. We have invested over 33,000 battle
							deaths, 20,000 non-battle deaths, and over 100,000 wounded in the
							security of an independent Republic of Korea. We have maintained large
							forces in that country for 17 years. We have invested over six billion
							dollars (almost half the total <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Marshall</persName> Plan) in economic and military assistance. We
							have recently massively reinforced our air power in Korea and the
							immediate adjoining areas. We have carried the banner for Korea in the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> over and over again. You should
							find ways to make it clear that Korean suspicion against this record is
							simply incomprehensible to the American people. The danger is that it
							will be deeply resented back here with potentially disastrous results
							for both countries.<note n="2" xml:id="d157fn2">On March 7 <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reiterated this message to

                        <p>3. To get this distinction across to Park we are transmitting <gloss target="#t_Septel1">septel</gloss> text of another personal letter

							craft naval vessels, combat and other vehicles and self-propelled
							artillery. The availability of equipment should be kept in mind in the

                        <p>6. It seems from here that for maximum political benefit this info should

                        <p>8. Final Caveat: You should convey to Park in whatever words you find
							appropriate that loose talk in Korea about pulling back some forces from
							Vietnam has not been well received here. We cannot believe that any

                        <p>111264. You are authorized convey following message from President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to President Park:
							“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> has transmitted
							to me the text of your thoughtful letter of February 5.<note n="2" xml:id="d159fn2">
                                <ref target="#d155">Document 155</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>He has also given me your views, expressed orally to him, on the conduct
							of the negotiations between the United Nations Command and the North
							Korean Senior Members of the Military Armistice Commission.</p>
                        <p>I am keenly aware of your desire that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							seizure and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> complaints against North
							Korea not be treated as unrelated matters. I agree fully that a solution
							of the one without a solution of the other would be incomplete. I would
							like, therefore, to give you my further views as to how the two problems
							should be related. I believe that we can separate the short question of
							negotiating tactics from the longer run and continuing problem of
							ensuring the security of the Republic of Korea against attack from the
							north.</p>
                        <p>First, let me refer to the negotiating problem. Delicate negotiations of
							this kind cannot hope to succeed if conducted in public; they would
							degenerate to the level of propaganda exchanges characteristic of
							Military Armistice Commission meetings in the past.</p>
                        <p>We do not object in principle to your other suggestion, that the UNC
							Senior Member be joined by a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> member
							in future meetings with the North Korean Senior Member; however, we
							doubt very much that the North Korean side would agree, and we do not
							wish to risk a breakdown in these discussions.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I realize that the method of private discussions
							between the UNC and the North Korean Senior Members has created a
							political and public relations problem for you. The Korean public, the
							press, government officials, military officers and even members of your
							cabinet, have concluded that the US is engaging in those private
							discussions in order to reach an agreement on the problem of the Pueblo
							seizure separately and to neglect the broader range of problems posed
							for the Republic of Korea by North Korean violations of the Armistice
							Agreement.</p>
                        <pb n="340" xml:id="pg_340" facs="0372"/>
                        <p>Our reasons for wanting private discussions, moreover, are not easy to
							explain to the Korean public, and they do not suffice to allay the
							suspicions that are mounting and that threaten to impair our usually
							close and friendly cooperation. It is clearly not enough for your
							government and mine to explain that the success of the current
							negotiations for the release of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and
							crew will depend on secrecy. It is important that the immediate problem
							of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure and the longer-run problem
							of ensuring the security of the Republic of Korea against attack from
							the north be presented in somewhat different perspectives.</p>
                        <p>The seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> presents an immediate
							challenge to the United States which must be dealt with promptly and
							decisively. The measures to deal with this problem are not necessarily
							the same as the measures to deal with North Korean aggressive actions
							against the Republic of Korea. The United States will not, I assure you,
							humiliate itself or the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to obtain
							redress. But we cannot leave unexplored the possibility that secret
							negotiations, against the backdrop of increased military strength in the
							area, will achieve our immediate goal.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> problem, for which we must have
							an immediate solution, the security of the Republic of Korea against
							attack is a continuing problem. It will still exist after the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew have been released. It will
							not be solved by angry words uttered in the Military Armistice
							Commission, or by negotiations. It will require tangible and continuing
							measures to strengthen the Republic of Korea militarily. And if the
							Republic of Korea, as a result of North Korean threats against it, is
							visibly strengthened in its military stance, by the kind of measures I
							have already indicated to you, and which I shall outline in detail
							below, the North Koreans will have suffered a moral and psychological
							defeat in the current crisis.</p>
                        <p>If we succeed both in obtaining redress in the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure and in strengthening the security of the
							Republic of Korea, then we will indeed, in your words, have completely
							attained our common goal.</p>
                        <p>I am confident that you will see that the long run interest of your
							country in strengthening itself against possible attack is more
							important to you than the immediate problems of negotiating tactics and
							propaganda. I therefore want to give you more complete information on
							the measures I am proposing for the permanent strengthening of your
							military posture.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> already has
							discussed with you our willingness to provide certain equipment to
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Korea in conjunction
							with the deployment to Viet-Nam of additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. The equipment includes.</p>
                        <p>1. A $32 million counterinfiltration ‘package' which was jointly devised
							by your Chiefs of Staff and General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>. Certain key <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0373"/>items in this counterinfiltration package have been
							authorized for air delivery and many of these items will arrive in Korea
							within the next 15 days.</p>
                        <p>2. Two additional destroyers for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Navy, one of which will come from the active US Navy fleet. This
							destroyer is now undergoing overhaul, and will be delivered to the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Navy no later than April 30. The
							other is being activated from the US Navy reserve fleet and will be
							delivered after overhaul in 12 months or less.</p>
                        <p>3. A self-propelled 8 in. Howitzer artillery battalion.</p>
                        <p>4. A company of 12 UH–1–D helicopters.</p>
                        <p>In order to provide new programs of help, I have decided to increase
							military assistance to your forces in the current fiscal year by an
							additional $100 million.<note n="3" xml:id="d159fn3">On February 8
								President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> requested
								Congress approve the additional funds as part of his foreign aid
								program for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1969; see Department
								of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, March 4, 1968, pp.
								322–329.</note> This further amount will fund other items of
							equipment which should leave no doubt either in the minds of your people
							or in those of the North Koreans of our determination to see that you
							are in an even stronger position to withstand and repel further
							aggressive acts they might contemplate.</p>
                        <p>I trust, Mr. President, that the foregoing will amplify and support my
							previous assurances to you that my government's vital concern for the
							security of your country is undiminished. I hope that with this tangible
							evidence of support you will redouble your efforts to allay the
							suspicions of some of your countrymen that in the current crisis the
							United States is selfishly pursuing its own ends and neglecting its long
							standing commitments to the people and the government of the Republic of
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> stand ready, I
							am sure, to assist in this effort through their normal channels to the

							attitudes by KRA 0452,<note n="2" xml:id="d160fn2">In telegram KRA 0452,
								February 6, <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>
								warned against keeping Korean officials, other than Pak, unaware of
								U.S. intentions toward the crises in Korea. He also reported having
								obliquely reminded the South Koreans that the U.S. was not obligated
								to defend the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, should the latter
								deliberately provoke war. <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> described the atmosphere in South Korea as
								an “orgy of emotionalism,” in part deliberately incited by the
								government. He noted that a situation was rapidly developing “which
									<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> commies could exploit with
								explosive results. If they should make one or two big raids with
								some success, it is highly probable <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would retaliate instantly and that would really
								put the fat in the fire.” (Ibid.)</note> following is gist of
							private meeting requested by Gen <persName>Chang</persName>, CS, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>- AF with Gen Friedman. As expressed by
							Gen <persName>Chang</persName> he fears that speculation in press
							leading <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> people to demand punitive
							action against <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> for recent
							transgressions. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> silence on actions
							and intentions causing unrest and loss of confidence on part of Korean
							people. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> people harbor no
							anti-American sentiment; however, <persName>Chang</persName> fears that
							public pressures may cause “certain persons in high positions” to accede
							to popular demand. <persName>Chang</persName> concedes that punitive
							action taken unilaterally could spell military disaster for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. He told Friedman he has made this
							point with higher authorities on many occasions but was not sure that he
							could continue to hold the line too much longer. He fears he may be
							directed to direct airstrikes against <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							unilaterally. He urgently requested Friedman make known his concern with
							view to urging <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to clearly establish
							its position versus further <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> Armistice
							violations and thereby relieve unrest. Friedman commended
								<persName>Chang</persName> on position taken and assured his concern
							would be voiced through proper channels.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I conveyed message contained Ref A to President Park this morning. He
							expressed appreciation for the increased military aid which he said
							would be useful in present situation. He is convinced that military
							buildup alone, however, is useless when dealing with person like Kim
							Il-Sung. He said American policy seemed to consist of efforts to extract
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew and buildup on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> side, which means <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s must remain passive here in face of
							continual provocation. So far the anger of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> people has been contained because his government does
							not want war, but it will be impossible to remain passive when another
							incident occurs and he feels this is most likely.<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> reported on his seemingly effective
								efforts to persuade the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Joint
								Chiefs of the “unwisdom of a unilateral, uncoordinated, rash action
								taken in anger by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s alone,” but
								added that he remained unconvinced that the “emotional reaction from
								top <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s can entirely be
								controlled.” (Telegram KRA 0490 from Seoul, February 8; <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library, National Security
								File, Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident,
								Military Cables, Vol. II, February 1968 to March 1968)</note> That
							will start a war in Korea again.</p>
                        <p>2. He had examined closely military posture and readiness of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							forces and they are certainly not ready for war as compared to North
							Koreans. This means they would perhaps suffer heavy damage initially but
							they would suffer even more if they await attack and do not take
							preventive measures. He has given US assurance that he would not take
							unilateral action and he wants prior consultation with the United
							States. He also has faith in competence and authority of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command, but lack of combat readiness
							disturbs him. He realizes that General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> has not been given a war mission but fact
							remains that entire position on our side now is such as to encourage Kim
								Il-Sung.<note n="4" xml:id="d161fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> recommended
								that U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces
								begin considering ways to improve vulnerabilities, such as
								constructing additional airfields in more secure locations, and
								examining ways “to insure North Korea cannot continue to enjoy
								complete sanctuary in its territory if it engages further in
								suicide-team raids against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.” He
								commented that “if we can develop a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ‘porous war' totally black method of insuring no
								sanctuary for <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> held under joint
									US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> control, this would
								really face up to gut problem remaining between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has many things to recommend it.”
								(Ibid.)</note> He said an example of our unpreparedness is that
							approximately <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0376"/>200 US military
							aircraft had come into country and cannot be accommodated. There is even
							a problem of takeoff, and ROKAF planes were inferior to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> planes. A MIG–21 needs only to have a
							button pushed to take off, whereas the F–5 cannot start without
							auxiliary assistance. It is bad thing to have to sit and await attack.
							What would United States have done if he and his family had been
							assassinated? Would we have proceeded to negotiate?</p>
                        <p>3. Foregoing indicates pent-up emotions of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> President at this point and he gave me two-and-a-half
							hours of it. I replied to his various points, emphasizing as I had done
							twice before that we depended on his leadership, restraint of hotheads
							and undertaking consultations in advance with us regardless of
							circumstances. On question on Kim Il-Sung I gave him report of recent
							developments to be reported separately.<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">Not
								further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Before I got to subject he launched into strong denunciation of our
							move of Enterprise southward. Enterprise should have been moved
							northward, he said, with other carriers and placed off port of Wonsan.
							We should have announced port was closed until we got men and ship back.
							If this brought no action we should go in and take ship, and neither
							Russians nor ChiComs would interfere.</p>
                        <p>5. When he finished this aspect of his statement I gave him para seven of
							Ref B. He brushed this aside, saying that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> closest ally of United States but our recent
							negotiating tactics are only encouraging Kim Il-Sung and creating
							distress among Korean people. Kim Il-Sung is a pirate and a thief, and
							he took a ship and raided Seoul in a criminal manner, and now the US
							expects to get results by talking to him. What makes US think such
							tactics will work?</p>
                        <p>6. I said I know he understands that our commitment in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is to protect the integrity and
							security of South Korea. That we are intent on doing, as he could see
							from the very generous measures being taken, but we are not going to
							give up possibility of achieving settlement of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident through peaceful means. If population here is
							disturbed it is, as I told Prime Minister and other ministers, because
							proper use had not been made of all of the statements of solidarity and
							support and all of the evidence of it provided by United States since
							this crisis developed.</p>
                        <p>7. There was a great deal of repetitive material of similar nature in his
							remarks, and he made a special point of asking that they be transmitted
							to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. I said the
							President had made it clear in public announcements that President
							Park's views are heard and considered and acted upon on a daily basis.
							And he could rest assured <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0377"/>that
							this would continue to be the case. However we do expect him to
							understand, as the message said, that the two matters of <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> violations and the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> have to be handled separately. We are convinced that
							this is only rational way to go about it.</p>
                        <p>8. Interview terminated and I left President's office to find that Prime
							Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs had been sitting outside with
							rather obvious ill humor for an hour. Shortly thereafter I received
							phone call from confidential interpreter Cho who stated that President,
							after rereading President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s letter, wished to make it clear that he is against
							closed meetings at Panmunjom. I said I took note of this.</p>
                        <p>9. He had made no mention of this except in general terms of meetings at
							Panmunjom and did not voice to me his opposition to closed meetings. I
							did say to him at beginning of our interview that there would be mention
							of Panmunjom in message from President but, as he knew, I would be
							discussing this matter as necessary with Prime Minister and did not
							intend to get into it unless he wished to do so himself. Of course
							during message itself and subsequent conversation dealing with our
							general negotiating tactics he made frequent reference to Panmunjom and,
							as he put it, the distrust aroused locally by our tactics.</p>
                        <p>10. I am seeing Prime Minister shortly, who will probably reiterate their
							opposition to closed meetings. I intend to make it clear that we cannot
							see our only line of contact cut on this subject. Comment: We have had
							suggestions from various quarters that if we could accept <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officer at Panmunjom, not to
							participate but for show purposes, this would do much to allay their
							suspicions and would help with public. I am not certain of value of this
							argument because underlying all the heaving about is something else
							which we have described to you, which is their hungering desire, which
							Park shares, to close with the North Koreans. However, if you feel you
							can authorize this on an absolutely non-veto, non-delay basis, I would
							like to offer it to them.</p>
                        <p>11. Your Ref B suggests meeting be set up tomorrow. We can do this but I
							would like your comments on this message if possible before proceeding
							because it is quite possible that we may be approaching showdown stage
							with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s on issue of closed meetings at
							Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>12. On most important matter of restraining <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, we may well be at point where we should repeat
							injunction to Syngman Rhee who at one time also felt need to go north.
							There is enough danger now without more provocation from <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s but situation will become very much

                        <p>1. Prime Minister requested me to call this afternoon. Foreign Minister
							and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s Principal Secretary Hong
							also present. This meeting revolved almost entirely around their pleas
							to save their face through some kind of arrangement assuring <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> presence at Panmunjom private meetings.
							I told them that we cannot risk having this channel cut off, and we felt
							quite certain that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>'s would refuse to
							participate if we insisted on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							presence. Instead of urging something of this kind they should be taking
							lead with all the material we had furnished to face their Assembly and
							form press opinion. It seemed incredible that fact that we wished to use
							only channel available to us to try to get release of crew and <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> should cause such a stir in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and I told <persName>Chong</persName>
							we looking directly to him and his colleagues to get matters back in
							hand. We would all find ourselves in much worse condition if we tried to
							introduce <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> representative into closed
							meetings there and encountered as a result <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> refusal to meet.<note n="3" xml:id="d162fn3">The evening
								of February 8 the Presidential Secretary phoned the Embassy and
								“indicated reluctant recognition of fact that closed meetings at

								Koreans were ready to accept the situation. (Telegram 4090 from

                        <p>2. They inquired about Secretaries meetings and I said these are called
							as they seem necessary. Could we call one? I said I would look into it.
							They apparently draw some comfort from fact that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> representative is present at such meetings.</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister said that we could really turn heat off of this issue
							here if we would consider distinguished special envoy coming directly
							from President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. I knew
							they were thinking in this vein, which was reason I mentioned subject in

							the atmosphere here at this point and there would be little purpose in
							having such a visitor encounter demonstrations, hostile press comment
							and the like. <persName>Chong</persName> was most vehement in his
							assurance that there would be no problem of this nature, he and Foreign
							Minister reiterating time and again that a high-level visitor would
							solve the problem.</p>

                        <p>4. These ministers displayed none of the tough attitude I encountered in
							President Park earlier in day. They did not touch on any aspect of need
							for military measures against the North, being solely concerned with
							drubbing they are receiving from Assembly and press.</p>
                        <p>5. It is true that announcement of high-level visitor would preoccupy
							Assembly and press as we proceed with our closed meetings at Panmunjom
							during next few days. I am unable to assess at this point what lasting
							value it might have. If things worsen here, it could very well be of
							great assistance to us to have President Park and his friends told what
							consequences of any uncoordinated action against the north would be. On
							balance I favor such a visit provided a prestigious public figure would
							be available to make it.</p>

                        <p>On February 8, 1968, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> received instructions from the Department of
							State to “inform President Pak in confidence that we are giving urgent
							consideration to sending an envoy to talk with him.” (Telegram 112452 to

							Library, National Security File, Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident—Cactus IIa, Cactus Seoul Cables, February 10
							to February 28, 1968) The action was in response to a request made by
							Korean Foreign Minister <persName>Choi</persName> through Ambassador Kim
							to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> on January 31. The Foreign Minister believed that
							by sending a special presidential envoy to Korea to address the crises
							brought on by the Blue House raid and the seizure of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> the United States <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0380"/>would demonstrate its commitment to
							South Korea and affirm the strength of the bilateral relationship.
							(Memorandum of conversation, January 31; National Archives and Records
							Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US) When informing the United States Embassy
							in Seoul of this conversation, Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> noted the Department of State's
							initial reluctance to send an envoy out of concern that the move “would
							arouse wide speculation as to why he was sent and why normal channels
							were to be reinforced, and even rumors that we contemplating military
							action.” (Telegram 109068 to Seoul, February 2; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> also expressed reservations,
							noting that sending an envoy to Korea presented no clear advantage to
							the United States. (Telegram 3902 from Seoul, February 3; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US)</p>
                        <p>Although the South Korean request initially received a cool reception,
							the Department of State and the White House continued to consider the
							request as events unfolded within Korea. In telegram 120315 to Tokyo,
							February 24, briefing the Ambassador on a possible mission, the
							Department noted that the raid on the Blue House followed by the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident had “caused consternation within
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and emotional fury on the part
							of the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> leadership, particularly
							President Park, who became increasingly obsessed with the desire to
							strike back across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.” U.S.
							diplomatic efforts to address the crises in the United Nations and
							through the Military Armistice Commission caused the South Korean
							leaders to view U.S. intentions with increasing suspicion. Within a
							short period of time relations between the United States and the
							Republic of Korea had seriously deteriorated. In light of those
							developments, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							decided to send a special envoy to South Korea. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/VANCE)</p>
                        <p>On February 9 President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
							wrote to President Pak confirming the appointment of Cyrus R. Vance as
							special envoy. Vance's instructions from the President were to discuss
							“current common problems, to inform himself on the current critical
							situation, and to report back to me his findings and recommendations.”
							(Letter from President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> to
							President Pak, February 9; <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library, National Security File, Head of State
							Correspondence, Korea, Park Correspondence, Vol. I) Immediately after
							release of a White House announcement of the appointment, Vance left for
							Korea. He was accompanied by Colonel Abbott C. Greenleaf, Military
							Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and by John P. Walsh,
							Deputy Executive Secretary, Daniel A. O'Donohue, Foreign Affairs
							Officer, and Maria E. Gardosik, Secretariat Assistant from the
							Department of State. The Vance mission arrived in Seoul on February 11
							and departed on February 15. (Vance Mission to Korea, Chronology,

                        <pb n="349" xml:id="pg_349" facs="0381"/>
                        <p>The importance of and the delicacy surrounding the Vance mission's
							objectives of easing tensions and buttressing U.S. relations with the
							Republic of Korea was underscored by the Department of State's rejection
							of the request by the Embassy in Japan for Vance to return to the United
							States via Tokyo to brief the Japanese on his findings in Korea.
							(Telegrams 5513 from Tokyo, February 10, and 113554 to Seoul and Tokyo,
							February 11; both National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,

							In addition, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>,
							General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>, and Vance
							agreed that the latter should travel directly from Seoul to Washington,
							rather than proceeding to Saigon as President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> wished, so that the purpose of
							the mission was not diluted by other stops and issues. Because of the
							“depth of emotions in Seoul” and to eliminate any risk of affronting
							President Pak and other Korean leaders, Vance was to report the findings
							of his mission personally to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> immediately upon his return to the United
							States. (Message from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to

                        </p>
                        <p>1. With regard to the development of a joint <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> Group, as
							recommended in ref A, I asked Gen <persName corresp="#p_BGDE1">Beach</persName> for his comments. He has submitted the following
							analysis in which I concur.</p>
                        <p>2. The growing impatience of the South Koreans with lack of US direct
							action and our declining prestige as a result thereof are recognized.
							The question to be addressed is whether a combined <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US unconventional warfare (<gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss>) planning staff and the conduct of black
							operations <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0382"/>will effectively
							stem this criticism without engendering more serious problems for the
							United States. This question must be reviewed in light of other
							significant measures being undertaken, including the major increase in
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, the air movement of <gloss target="#t_CIGCOREP1">CIGCOREP</gloss> equipment, and the permanent
							stationing of additional US forces in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Is the US willing to collaborate in deliberate violations of the
							Armistice Agreement of 1953, and if so, will <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations against North Korea (<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>) have any reasonable prospects for success? The
							advantages-disadvantages of the establishment of a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss>
							planning group are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Advantages:</p>
                        <p>A. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have a capability in <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> already developed and may employ it
							unilaterally. A combined <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> planning
							staff may bring operations more under US control.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations are less expensive in
							personnel, equipment, and funds (gold flow) than purely defensive
							measures. They are, however, no substitute for such defensive
							measures.</p>
                        <p>C. North Koreans understand retaliation and may slow down their
							incursions if successful <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations
							can be conducted.</p>
                        <p>D. The establishment of a combined planning group may help convince the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> top level that the US will not
							tolerate <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provocations and it may raise
							US prestige with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders. It may
							temporarily pacify them.</p>
                        <p>E. If the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders are convinced, some
							controlled and favorable public reaction in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is possible.</p>
                        <p>F. Controlled black raids are not likely to provoke initiation of
							hostilities and they might forestall ill-conceived <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliation efforts.</p>
                        <p>G. Possible training advantages could accrue for US <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> personnel.</p>
                        <p>H. If successful, <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations may
							increase our intelligence holdings on <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I. The probability of success, although low, would be improved with US
							participation in planning.</p>
                        <p>Disadvantages:</p>
                        <p>A. Establishment of a combined <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> planning
							group effectively commits the US to eventual conduct of <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations. To plan but never implement
							such operations would further lower <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							leaders' opinion of US resolve. It would convince the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s that unilateral action is the only
							answer.</p>
                        <p>B. Conduct of black operations would violate the Armistice and, if
							exposed, would subject the US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							to violent <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> propaganda attacks in
							international media and forums.</p>
                        <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>C. Types of <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations of most impact
							would require deep penetrations. The <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							security environment, unlike that in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, makes prospects for success very remote.</p>
                        <p>(1) Experience with pure intelligence operations, which run less risk of
							exposure than <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss>, has demonstrated the
							difficulty of penetration and travel in <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>. In 1963 all US intelligence penetration operations and
							support to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> operations were cancelled
							because agent loss rates exceeded 50 pct. Resumption of
							combined-intelligence operations in late 1964 reduced the loss rate but
							only one successful deep penetration has been conducted in past three
							years.</p>
                        <p>(2) Results of six known retaliatory piston-type operations conducted
							unilaterally by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> agencies since
							October 1966 are not known but they have failed to dissuade <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> from its aggressive infiltration program.
							D. Because of necessary close hold on <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss>
							planning and operations, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public
							would not be influenced favorably toward the US. Unsuccessful operations
							would be exposed publicly by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> and
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public opinion would be
							adversely affected. Overt strengthening of US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense forces would better serve to influence <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public opinion.</p>
                        <p>E. US operations are unlikely to dissuade <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> from its program of aggressive infiltration. Agents have
							been trained, plans and reconnaissance have been made and the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> leadership is callous toward its losses
							and lack of success in 1967–68. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> will
							continue and possibly step up its activities. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations
							essentially would become revenge motivated.</p>
                        <p>F. <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> forays across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> would cause a tightening of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> security efforts to the detriment of
								US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> intelligence operations.</p>
                        <p>G. <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations are counter to US policy
							and to the current <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> policy of the “iron hand in the
							velvet glove.”</p>
                        <p>H. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations that are compromised and exposed would have
							very adverse political repercussions in the United States and the free
							world.</p>
                        <p>I. Guerrilla, subversive and their counter-type training have been in
							progress in Communist countries for more than a decade. Under the
							current situation in <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>, it is unlikely
							that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US efforts in this field could
							achieve any measurable success.</p>
                        <p>J. US collaboration in planning joint <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss>
							operations but without implementation would strengthen the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s present conviction that their
							dissatisfaction with the US is justified.</p>
                        <p>K. Exposure of <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations will further
							adversely affect relations with the USSR and will prejudice relations
							with our allies and neutral nations.</p>
                        <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0384"/>
                        <p>L. <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations will divert <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US efforts to an area which even if
							successful has very little prospects of calming situation. In fact, such
							operations may well aggravate the tension which now exists.</p>
                        <p>4. Conclusions: A. The benefits to be derived from US participation in a
							combined <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> planning group are likely to be of limited value in
							satisfying <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leadership and public of
							[1 or more lines of text missing on the source text].</p>
                        <p>[B.] tion of other overt measures being taken to enhance the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>- US defense posture will be more
							effective in restoring confidence in US determination.</p>
                        <p>C. There is very little prospect that meaningful <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations can be successfully conducted in the tight
							security environment of North Korea.</p>
                        <p>D. Participation by US in the planning and conduct of <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations against <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> entails a major reversal of US policy without the
							promise of commensurate returns.</p>
                        <p>E. Our US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> policy, patience and
							steadfast determination over the past 15 years have been instrumental in
							preventing the reopening of hostilities in Korea and reducing the
							possibility of WW III. Emotional retaliatory actions will risk
							deterioration of present US discussions and may negate the gains
							achieved in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> over this long
							period.</p>
                        <p>5. Continued emphasis should be placed on keeping key military leaders
							advised of measures that the US is taking to strengthen the US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defense posture.</p>
                        <p>6. Concurrently, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders should be
							warned of where the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> stands without
							US backing. It should be made clear that the US will not start WW III on
							the basis of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provocations of the
							present scale. They should be reminded that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> itself has much to suffer if hostilities are
							renewed.</p>
                        <p>7. Efforts must be continued to convince the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s of the benefits of enlisting world opinion against the
							illegal aggressive actions of the Kim Il Sung regime. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US launched <gloss target="#t_UW1">UW</gloss> operations would risk forfeiture of the advantageous
							reputation that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> now enjoys.</p>
                        <p>8. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> recommends that
							development of a joint US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							unconventional warfare group to conduct operations in and against North
							Korea be held in abeyance and not approved at this time.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I called on <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> this morning to
							discuss with him our plans for open and closed meetings. Foreign
							Minister also present.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName>Chong</persName> was obviously pleased at thought we would
							have open meeting, which might provide photographs and new comment
							sufficient to obscure in part at least fact of closed meeting. Foreign
							Minister again declared <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> opposition
							to closed meetings which I countered with statement of our need keep
							this channel open.</p>
                        <p>3. They pressed me hard on question of envoy, saying his early arrival
							crucial in present situation. For first time they seemed as much
							concerned about President Park's state of mind as with Assembly and
							public opinion. I told them that matter of envoy being considered and I
							might have something to say to them in near future. They then went off
							to see the President.</p>
                        <p>4. After their interview with him, Foreign Minister asked me to come very
							urgently to his office. He was alone and obviously in very agitated
							state of mind. He was still concerned about closed meetings and read me
							statement which he said he had written down at President's request and
							which expressed <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> insistence that we
							hold only open sessions of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> at
							Panmunjom. If open sessions are inconvenient in our effort for regaining
							wounded and crew of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and U.S. Government
							needs to continue closed meetings, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government insists that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officer
							should accompany UNC representative to closed meeting. Their position
							has not changed on this. The Foreign Minister said he did his best but
							President used “very strong words” and position remained unchanged.</p>
                        <p>5. I said it was incomprehensible to us how <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> friends could insist on a move which would close the
							only channel available to us. Their alternative to this, as he knew, was
							to face their public opinion in Assembly, announce the full consultation
							we had had on this subject and state their agreement with us. He pleaded
							that at least we postpone the next closed meeting until after the
							envoy's arrival. (<hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: On <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0386"/>this last point I need to know your
							wishes soonest for we are withholding request for both open and closed
							meetings until hearing from you.)<note n="3" xml:id="d166fn3">The
								Department of State rejected the request, emphasizing that it was
								imperative that the United States “proceed with private seniors
								meeting as often as necessary to keep heat on North Koreans.”
								(Telegram 112650 to Seoul, February 9; National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. <persName>Choi</persName> then made lengthy statement on very
							frustrating position that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
							finds itself in. “We have six hundred thousand men and we are not doing
							anything,” he declared, obviously reciting President's line. (This was
							new for him. Hitherto he has been concerned only about Panmunjom
							meetings.) He declared President's position is intolerable and that
							President does not know what United States will do if another <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> raid takes place.
								<persName>Choi</persName> declared that we should quickly “negotiate
							pieces of paper” which will state exactly what would happen in way of
							retaliation in such circumstance. He said there should also be a direct
							joint public warning to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> stating
							clearly what would happen if there is another incident. This man was so
							distraught after his visit with President that I merely commented mildly
							that if we did what he said we would be signaling our intentions in a
							way which could benefit only the adversary. He said he could resign but
							that would not solve anything and he wanted to impress upon me that the
							things he was saying to me might be a “last warning.”</p>
                        <p>7. Here I recalled to him my statement to the President, to the Prime
							Minister and to the Foreign Minister earlier that in any circumstances
							regardless of provocation we expect full advance consultation on any
							measures they might envisage. He said that President Park kept repeating
							that every time he mentions need for retaliation I talk about advance
							consultation and the President feels very frustrated. I said that might
							be true but we have obligations to each other which we must not
							forget.</p>

                        <p rend="center">Special Instruction</p>
                        <p>You should arrange for a secret conversation with President Park with
							only his interpreter and/or personal assistant, Yi Hu-rak present. You
							should decide who should accompany you. You are to convey the following
							in any manner and with any elaboration you deem desirable.</p>
                        <p>1. The immediate release of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its
							crew is required to reduce quickly the tension in the area and the
							danger of war. This is of transcendent importance. But there is another
							aspect that is extremely important to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. The country and the Congress have welcomed the President's restraint
							in the face of this great provocation, just as it has welcomed President
							Park's restraint in the face of the Blue House raid. If the crew and the
							vessel are not returned quickly, this will not only become a very
							serious matter between the U.S. and the North Koreans, but it can become
							a very serious matter on the American political scene. President Park
							knows the problem of free elections. This is an election year in the
							U.S., and the issue could become a major one in the campaign in such a
							way as to affect U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations and
							our position in Southeast Asia. This is the second reason why the U.S.
							must do its utmost and use every possible means to obtain the immediate
							release of the crew and the vessel. The private meetings channel is at
							present the only one which offers any prospect of obtaining release and
							we must give it every opportunity to show whether it will produce
							results. We cannot throw this matter into open meetings of the Military
							Armistice Commission, or insist on a Republic of Korea representative
							attending the public meetings, which would certainly produce a breakdown
							of these talks.</p>
                        <p>3. The President is deeply appreciative of the closeness of the exchanges
							which have been taking place in this very grave situation. It reminds
							him of the close and continuing contacts between President Roosevelt and
							Prime Minister Churchill during World War II and he <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0388"/>wants to keep it that way. The
							President understands President Park's domestic problems and he wants
							President Park to understand his. There is no substitute for this
							personal trust and confidence at a time like this.</p>
                        <p>4. We are not going to abandon the Republic of Korea when the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew are returned, but we will
							remain in Korea in even stronger force than before. President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> urges President Park to be calm
							and patient, not to permit any of his officers to engage in rash acts
							which might lead to fighting on the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>,
							which would create a wholly new set of problems and dangers and strains
							on our alliance, as well as interrupt the great progress that the
							Republic of Korea has been making under President Park.</p>

                        <p>KRA 0513. 1. I have been deeply disturbed over last several days at
							growing irrationality in certain areas <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, most especially in President Park himself. Inputs in
							last day have confirmed that Park is almost irrationally obsessed with
							need to strike now at North Koreans, with sort of “apres moi le deluge”
							philosophy accentuated by our secret talks with <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> at Panmunjom. You will see, I trust, AmEmb's and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
							reports on today's developments<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">See <ref target="#d166">Documents 166</ref> and <ref target="#d170">170</ref>.</note> but these are confirmed to some degree by
							inputs from <gloss target="#t_MI1">MI</gloss> sources indicating
							directives for planning for immediate retaliation in event <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> raids, and info from CS/ROKAF that he
							fears he may receive orders from Blue House for unilateral air strikes,
							which he knows would be suicidal. We are taking all feasible preventive
							measures, which cannot be 100 percent, and I feel, or at least hope,
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Chiefs of Staff would disobey
							such orders, due to numerous talks with them, except after violent
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provocation.</p>
                        <pb n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0389"/>
                        <p>2. However unreasonable Pres. Park's obsessive drive may appear to
							Washington, I wish to state frankly that we have given him no real idea
							of what we intend to do or alternative courses, and so I believe we have
							brought large part of it on ourselves. It is absolutely essential, to my
							mind, that we give certain <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s,
							including chiefs of services, some concept or strategy as to what we
							intend to do. They know we are making contingency plans, but they do not
							know what, where, when or why and in meantime our actions are highly
							confusing to them. Responsible <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, and
							I include military chiefs among these, are scared at recent turn of
							emotions in Pres. Park's and a few others' minds. They know full well
							that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> cannot survive without genuine
							US support.</p>
                        <p>But they have no clear idea what we mean to do, and suspect we do not
							either, on next phases of action. This is not fear only of US compromise
							but equally that we might take some militarily provocative action that
							would precipitate war without their having taken even most elemental
							steps to safeguard their population or to mobilize their military
							strength. The only plan that we advance to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s is first a peaceful try to get back <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew (which does not impress anyone here as moving very
							fast especially since we seem to be withdrawing military power) while we
							build military power, then second, if <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew
							not returned some sort of action.</p>
                        <p>3. One Korean wag characterizes our concept of “the steel fist in the
							velvet glove,” as “the silken fist in silken glove.”<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">Reference is to the U.S. policy adopted toward the
								North Koreans in the wake of the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>; see <ref target="#d237">Document 237</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Our inscrutable policy combined with Kim Il-Song's speech last night
							on 20th anniversary of Korean Peoples Army (reported by FBIS and on news
							service broadcasts) in which he says, among other things, that
							“situation shows war can be touched off by US imperialists any
							moment”—these two factors do not help <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> sanity at moment. (We can see effective psywar of
							nerves in Kim's speech, but not all <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							are so “sophisticated.”)</p>
                        <p>5. UNC/<gloss target="#t_USFK1">USFK</gloss> have studied <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> TS <gloss target="#t_Noforn1">Noforn</gloss> message 030154Z Feb 68<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">Not found.</note> and believe US military contingency planning is
							fine but can find in it no inkling of strategic concept we could express
							to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s which would enable them to know
							what mobilization or civil defense planning or implementation steps to
							take [garble] when to take care of their 30 million people, their homes
							or their industry. Only guidance I have is State message saying do not
							let them mobilize their reserve divisions at this time. I fully agree
							with guidance, but would like to be able to give <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s some rationale.</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0390"/>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_Noforn1">Noforn</gloss> messages we get do not seem
							to appreciate there are at least three, not one, unknowns in situation
							here. Most seem oriented primarily on what would happen if <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s took certain overt initiatives. We in
								<gloss target="#t_USFK1">USFK</gloss> are not flapping here, but we
							would like some greater consideration of, first, what if <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s take unilateral initiatives. Second,
							what if <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s deliberately provoke <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> unilateral initiative, and third, what
							if US actions, which we have not conveyed to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s in sufficiently timely fashion, provoke unexpected
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> reaction. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s are most scared of possible <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> unconventional guerrilla raid offensive and believe this
							inevitable if US does not take strong stand soon.</p>
                        <p>7. I have tried for some days now to express in more formal language the
							Mad Hatter's tea party atmosphere among high-level <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s here. Forgive my reverting to the
							vernacular, but most seriously it will be very important that Cy Vance
							come here prepared to answer in some way the questions of what the US is
							prepared to do, particularly re stopping <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> infiltration threat by threat of force if necessary, and
							the what, when, where and why type of questions including some of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> mobilization and civil defense. He
							should also be prepared, if necessary, to talk turkey re unilateral
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliation at this time.
							Finally, if we could turn the visit into a sort of a minor session like
							Roosevelt-Churchill strategy talks at Argentina early in WWII some
							constructive results may be obtained. What is happening in Saigon is not
							making Pres. Park any more calm.</p>
                        <p>8. I have not shown this message to Amb <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> tonight but will show him first thing
							tomorrow.</p>

							the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew, and one involving
							the Republic of Korea in the face of North Korean provocations. The
							provocations against the Republic of Korea are a problem for both
							countries, not just the Republic of Korea, and the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> is not just our problem but requires South Korean
							cooperation to be resolved.</p>
                        <p>3. To explain to Park that we are committed to using peaceful means to
							resolve both sets of problems and until we have clearly abandoned hope
							for a peaceful settlement we must reserve judgment as to further courses
							of action.</p>
                        <p>4. To ask Park publicly and privately to associate himself with our view
							that he too seeks a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>5. To obtain a reaffirmation that the authority of General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> and the chain of command
							will be absolutely observed.</p>
                        <p>6. To impress on Park that just as we will not take unilateral reprisal
							actions against the North Koreans in the present, tense situation
							without full advance consultation with him, we expect that no unilateral
							reprisal actions will be taken by the Republic of Korea, organized or
							spontaneous, without full advance consultation with us, and to inform
							him that such <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> actions could well
							alienate American and world opinion and destroy the very foundation of
							both the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> case and our case and
							endanger support for our alliance.</p>
                        <p>7. To convince Park that we must pursue private meetings with the North
							Koreans to obtain release of crew and vessel, until we are convinced
							that further talks of this kind are fruitless and we must look to other
							courses of action.</p>
                        <p>8. To make Park understand that the attachment of a South Korean to the
							private meetings is impossible because the North Koreans will not accept
							it and if we make an issue of this it will terminate the private
							meetings.</p>
                        <p>9. To make Park understand that open meetings of the Military Armistice
							Commission will not solve either the provocation problem or the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. It is a propaganda forum.</p>
                        <p>10. To make Park understand that when the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							Case is settled we will not return to the status quo but by our actions
							in providing additional military and counter-infiltration assistance and
							by keeping augmented forces in and around South Korea we will display
							our determination to stand with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>11. To stress to President Park that the continuing public evidence of
							differences between us, any threat to return units from Viet-Nam, any
							indication of unilateral action by South Korea against the North will
							only play into the hands of the North Koreans.</p>
                        <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>12. To show Park that we have played the game with him in full trust and
							confidence and we expect full trust and confidence from him.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I went to Blue House this morning to receive letter which President
							Park proposed to send to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in reply to message contained reftel. After
							reading text I said that as friend I wanted to make some comments to him
							and particularly with regard to phrases demanding immediate retaliatory
							action and warning of punitive action by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces if <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s do not
							acknowledge their aggression, apologize and give guarantees for future.
							I said such phraseology was not well designed to meet problems of my
							President and I had suggestions to offer. (These suggestions of course
							involved considerable toning down and elimination of phraseology, and
							after hour and half of wrangling I finally induced him to hold letter
							and reconsider entire approach.)</p>
                        <p>2. He burst out on several occasions declaring that I was emasculating
							all of his ideas. I said all of his ideas expressed orally had been
							transmitted and were receiving attention highest levels in Washington,
								<pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0393"/>but I had to emphasize to
							him that it was a mistake to put these things in writing. To mention but
							one complication reference to the UNC automatically involved many
							friendly nations and this had to be considered very carefully. I left
							them (President and SecGen) with understanding they would redraft letter
							but I am not sure that Park will not reinsert phraseology which he
							personally inserted in first place. It may be that they will hold the
							letter until after Vance visit or may even try to hand it to Vance to
							carry to the President.</p>
                        <p>3. He expressed appreciation President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> sending Mr. Vance here but made it clear that he
							is hoping for some indications of decisive course of action.</p>
                        <p>4. We will transmit text of draft letter separately for your information.
							I repeat it was to be redrafted and was not signed when I was at Blue
							House.</p>
                        <p>5. To enable <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to properly

                        <p>1. In various dispatches, the latest of which is Ref A, you have
							expressed a need to inform the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s of
							our strategy in the present situation. In paragraph 5 of Ref A you
							indicate that you believe US <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0394"/>
							military contingency planning as expressed by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> in Ref B is fine but can find
							in it no inkling of a strategic concept you could express to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>2. In the wealth of dispatches regarding the current situation, which are
							too numerous to tabulate, it would seem to me that our strategy is
							clear. I will give it to you briefly as I see it. The United States
							intends to accomplish the return of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							crew by diplomatic means without becoming embroiled in a second front
							war in Korea. We also hope to have the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							itself returned through diplomatic means, although return of the ship is
							less important than return of the crew. We do not intend to take any
							military course of action for return of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew because we know of no action that offers any
							promise of getting the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew back alive.
							The buildup of air and naval units is designed to support our diplomatic
							efforts while at the same time increasing our readiness.</p>
                        <p>3. You have not been permitted to discuss our strategy with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s because such discussion would run the
							risk of upsetting our careful and deliberate course of action. When the
							United States decides to use its military force, if it does, you will be
							notified in time that you may further notify the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. Until that time you will need to keep higher levels
							of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government calmed down to the
							best of your ability.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States does not want any unilateral action by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s which would upset negotiations for
							return of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew or involve the United
							States in armed action in Korea. It should be further apparent that
							United States Armed Forces are fully employed in Vietnam and that people
							of the United States are not prepared to see their country involved in a
							second war.</p>
                        <p>5. I am sure you realize as I do that we have no intention of allowing
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s to get us involved in a war of
							their choosing, and we expect to control the situation to insure that
							they don't. Our participation in any armed action that they start is not
							automatic. One of your greatest chores at the moment is to keep things
							calmed down and under control and I realize perfectly that you are not
							able to convey much information to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s that will assist you in satisfying them.</p>
                        <p>6. US strategy as I have outlined it to you in the paragraphs above is
							not the result of any specific guidance from the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> but rather my own estimate.</p>

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin text</hi>. Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, I received your kind letter which has given details of your
							views again through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I understand your view that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident, a
							question of immediate concern to you, should be dealt with separately
							“in somewhat different perspectives” and with differing tactics from the
							longer run question of ensuring the security of the Republic of Korea as
							you have termed.</p>
                        <p>However, the North Korean commandos' intrusion into Seoul has given such
							a particular and serious impact upon my people that an alien would find
							it hard to grasp it fully and the indignant feelings of my people
							against the North Korean Communists seem to have reached the apex.</p>
                        <p>Although it is understandable to me that you are seeking an earliest
							possible solution to the question of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>,
							you will no doubt know that my personal understanding cannot be equated
							with that of my fellow countrymen as you may have experienced yourself
							in dealing with various problems such as the Vietnam war. If Your
							Excellency considers it absolutely necessary to have further closed
							meetings with the North Koreans in order to have the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> back, it is <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0396"/>likewise necessary for us to have your assurances on
							the following points:</p>
                        <p>1. The problem of the North Korean raiders' incursion on Seoul, as
							separate from the question of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, will be
							brought before the Military Armistice Commission meetings in the
							immediately near future.</p>
                        <p>2. And we lodge a protest with the North Koreans; press them to admit the
							aggressive act, apologize for it and pledge that such an act will not be
							repeated in the future.</p>
                        <p>3. In case the North Koreans refuse to accept this:<note n="4" xml:id="d173fn4">The final version contained the added phrase “and
								change their attitude.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. The United Nations forces take an immediate retaliatory action;<note n="5" xml:id="d173fn5">This paragraph was changed to read: “The
								Republic of Korea and the United States Forces take an immediate
								retaliatory action in accordance with the provisions of the Mutual
								Defense Treaty between the two countries.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. And at the same time, issue a formal warning to them that the United
							Nations forces will take immediate punitive action should they continue
							to make resort to such actions in the future.<note n="6" xml:id="d173fn6">This paragraph was revised to read: “And at the
								same time, issue a formal warning to them that the Republic of Korea
								and the United States Forces will take immediate punitive action, if
								the North Koreans make resort to such actions again in the
								future.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>These, I believe, are the minimum measures<note n="7" xml:id="d173fn7">In
								the final version the word “required” was inserted here.</note> for
							ensuring the security of the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>I know Your Excellency is concerned with the security of our country more
							greatly than anyone else and are taking measures<note n="8" xml:id="d173fn8">This phrase was changed to read “and have taken
								measures.”</note> to strengthen our national defense. This I
							appreciate always.</p>
                        <p>But a fact remains that the infiltrations by the North Koreans into the
							South have increased, not decreased, since the Armistice although we
							have done our utmost to strengthen our defense capability. Therefore, I
							want you to understand the increasingly keener awareness among my people
							that increased defense capability alone will not<note n="9" xml:id="d173fn9">This section was modified to read “that
								strengthened defense alone will not.”</note> be complete in solving
							the problem of our security.</p>
                        <p>If we are to dissuade the North Koreans from their aggressive acts,
							simultaneously assuaging the wrath of my people, we should make the
							North Koreans fully recognize our resolute determination that we will
							not allow them to commit an aggressive act without subjecting themselves
								to<note n="10" xml:id="d173fn10">In the final letter the word “our”
								was inserted at this point.</note> immediate punitive action.</p>
                        <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>What I have so far outlined above is related to the measures for ensuring
							the security of my country, for which you have shown such a great
							concern, and I do not think that there may be any point of disagreement
							with you.</p>
                        <p>In summation, I am sure, that the security of the Republic of Korea rests
							on:</p>
                        <p>1. Strengthening<note n="11" xml:id="d173fn11">At this point in the final
								letter the word “of” was inserted.</note> our defense capability to
							such an extent where we maintain an absolute supremacy over the North,
							and</p>
                        <p>2. Driving it home to the North Koreans that an aggressive act will be
							met with immediate, stern punitive action.</p>
                        <p>If the North Koreans feel free that they can act on a premise that
							aggression against the South can be committed with impunity, no increase
							in our defense capability will give complete solution to our cardinal
							problem, an effective guarantee against any re-invasion by the
								North.<note n="12" xml:id="d173fn12">President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> responded to this letter on

                        <p>4142. Subject: <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> Plans for Vance
							Visit.</p>
                        <p>1. Stating he acting on instructions from FonMin, <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss> International Affairs Bureau Director
							called Pol Counselor to his office to discuss subjects <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s will wish to raise with Vance.</p>
                        <p>2. He led into this subject by stating that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is placing great expectations on Vance's visit, which
							could be real turning point in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/US
							relations. He said <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and entire
							Korean people hoped that Vance, a special emissary of President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, would not let <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> down, and in this context he referred
							to “failure” of 1953 visit under similar tense circumstances by Asst
							Secty Walter Robertson.</p>
                        <p>3. He then alluded to the fact that <gloss target="#t_MOFA1">MOFA</gloss>
							had been instructed by Blue House to prepare position paper for Vance
							and general outline of joint Park/Vance communique and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							joint declaration. He said that latter two should deal with three major
							points:</p>
                        <p>A. The question of Operational Control: He said that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s understood need to have CINCUNC retain
							operational control of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces but
							that there should be some change in rules of game. It seemed strange, he
							said, to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that when intruders
							penetrated deep into <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory,
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military commanders should have
							to seek CINC's permission to use <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							combat troops to destroy intruding forces. System should be changed to
							permit <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> commanders immediately to
							deploy against intruders, perhaps notifying CINCUNC that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces had been withdrawn from his
							operational control for such purposes. Furthermore, when intruders
							ventured into <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory and were
							engaged by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US forces, rules of
							game should permit application of principle of hot pursuit; <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s should not have to stop south of
								<gloss target="#t_MDL1">MDL</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. Punitive Measures: US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should
							make it clear to enemy and to rest of world that they will not permit
							North Korea conduct aggressive acts against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> without fear of retaliation. US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should announce that if intrusions
							continue, they will physically punish <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							by striking at root source of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							aggression. Not only should this <pb n="367" xml:id="pg_367" facs="0399"/>warning be made unequivocally clear in words of the governments, but
							some punitive action must be taken next time North Koreans strike. He
							suggested that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> guerrilla training
							camps might make suitable targets and said that if they were wiped out
							it would not mean local much less general war.</p>
                        <p>C. US Commitment: He said that most sophisticated Koreans are aware that
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> has authority
							to order US forces into combat without explicit Congressional approval
							and that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RVN1">RVN</gloss> would not exist today were this not so. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> populace, however, suffers from trauma
							from Korean War which has been reopened by US unwillingness to take
							military action following Blue House raid and <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident. People doubt that US will actually commit its
							forces to defend them in case <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							aggression continues and are especially concerned over language in
							Mutual Defense Treaty which says that each party will act in “accordance
							to its constitutional process.” What is needed, he said, is some flat
							statement in document to which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is
							party which spells out fact that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> can commit US forces without time-consuming
							Congressional debate and approval.<note n="2" xml:id="d174fn2">In a
								later discussion with <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
								the Foreign Minister referred to a 1953 secret agreement between the
								United States and Korea of which <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> had no knowledge. (Telegram 4177 from Seoul,
								February 12; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
								Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR
								N–US) Other <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials and the
								Korean media made reference to a U.S. arrangement with the
								Philippines as well as to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
								agreement, both of which committed the United States to respond
								automatically to any acts of aggression against those partners. The
								Koreans wanted the same type of unequivocal statement in their
								defense agreement with the United States. (Telegram 4159 from Seoul,
								February 12; ibid.) The Department of State responded that the U.S.
								Government had “made no secret defense commitments to either Korea
								or Philippines” quoting official statements that an armed attack
								against the Philippines would be considered an armed attack against
								the United States, which it believed the Koreans may have had in
								mind when making their demands. (Telegram 113906 to Seoul, February
								12; ibid.) The issue continued to be raised by Korean officials.
								(Telegram 4596 from Seoul, February 29, and airgram A–431 from
								Seoul, March 7; both ibid., DEF 4 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>-US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. Pol Counselor led him carefully through all the difficulties which
							surround each of propositions. Director agreed that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> was aiming high, but held firmly to
							position that something dramatic of nature he had described must come
							out of Vance's visit.</p>

                        <p>113671. <gloss target="#t_TOVAN1">TOVAN</gloss> 12. Eyes only for Vance
							from <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Please ask Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> to
							show you my <gloss target="#t_Nodis1">Nodis</gloss> 110828<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">
                                <ref target="#d157">Document 157</ref>.</note> as background for
							your talk with President Park.</p>
                        <p>2. The views contained therein are a fair reflection of the problems of
							public and Congressional opinion toward Korea which we would have here
							if the Koreans themselves are not careful. This type of material should
							not be used by you as a direct threat from one President to another but
							it should be used with great force to expose the kinds of problems which
							our President will face in trying to maintain our support for the
							Republic of Korea. On that basis, you can be very tough indeed because
							the problems are real.</p>
                        <p>3. If the matter of reduced <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							participation in Viet-Nam comes up, you should not hesitate to point out
							that that would require a reduced US participation in Korea. A <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division in Viet-Nam can only be
							replaced by a US division now in Korea. Further, Viet-Nam is where the
							battle is, and from a military point of view the problem of infiltration
							can be handled by the large forces present in South Korea. Of course, if
							North Korea launches an all-out invasion, that is another ballgame. But
							it is not in our interest, or in the interest of the Republic of Korea,
							to have another all-out war in Korea. Hence, it is folly for the South
							Koreans to take steps which would translate an infiltration problem into
							general hostilities. It's easy to get into such hostilities but very
							hard to bring them to a successful conclusion.<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> also wanted to instruct Vance to “request
								Korean permission for Westy [Westmoreland] to redeploy Korean forces
								if necessary; and indicate urgency of requirement for extra Korean
								division in Viet Nam.” (Memoranda from Rostow to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, February 12; <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> Library, National Security
								File, Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident,
								Vance Mission to Korea(B), February 9 to 15, 1968) <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> opposed adding the issue to
								those already to be raised by Vance. The President agreed “most
								reluctantly” to send this cable without an instruction to raise the
								question of the additional division. (Memoranda and draft telegram,
								February 12; ibid., State Department Cables, Vol. II, February
								1968)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. If President Park attempts to extract commitments which go beyond the
							terms of our Treaty of Alliance, you should state quite simply that no
							alteration of that treaty lies within the constitutional <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0401"/>power of our President. The treaty
							stands as agreed and is the primary source of the Republic of Korea's
							ability to maintain itself as a secure and independent nation. It is
							elementary, for example, that our President cannot remove the phrase “in
							accordance with its constitutional processes” from a Treaty of Alliance.
							We cannot entertain suspicions about the loyalty of the United States to
							its alliances at a time when we have just lost 900 killed in a ten-day
							period in Viet-Nam in the course of demonstrating our fidelity.</p>
                        <p>5. Your object is to combine an assurance to President Park of our
							steadiness and seriousness of purpose with an understanding on his side
							that we, too, have national interests engaged in the safety of his
							country and in peace in Northeast Asia. We expect from him the same
							degree of cooperation that he expects from us. If we each have internal
							public problems, which differ somewhat, the point is that our two
							Presidents should in consultation decide how to proceed in a way to deal
							with both sets of problems. We cannot give overriding priority to his
							problems if, by doing so, we undermine the very basis of US support to
							the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>6. All this means (a) we must maintain our war effort in Viet-Nam (b) we
							must use available channels at Panmunjom to free <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew (c) we must act together to insure security of
							Korea (d) we must not take action on our side to convert infiltration
							problem into a major war if it can be avoided and (e) we must each give
							leadership in our own countries to press and public opinion in the
							interest of our common purposes.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Lengthy session provided useful relief value for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> emotions. Tensions gradually eased as dialogue was
							established. Park reiterated at length themes made familiar by reports
							of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> in fatalistic
							and simplistic terms. While the President's sincerity was not in doubt
							it was evident that his specific proposals were the product of emotion
							rather than finished staff work.</p>
                        <p>Park charged with deep conviction that <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
								Il-Sung</persName> is on path of war. The rate of violation of the
							Armistice Agreement has increased markedly. The attack on the Blue House
							designed to kill him and his family and the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> were acts of war. The North Koreans have
							thousands of trained infiltrators and further serious penetrations are
							inevitable in the spring. They intend to harass the South Korean people,
							disrupt the economy and, when the country is sufficiently weakened,
							resort to all out war. They will only respect counterforce. They should
							be warned of the consequences of further violations, asked to apologize
							for past actions, and requested to promise not to violate the armistice
							agreement in the future. In addition we should publicly state that any
							future violations will be met by immediate retaliation. All courses of
							action in the present situation are dangerous but Park did not believe
							that retaliation would provoke the DRNK to war. Firmness and resolution
							are imperative in the present situation. The US world position depends
							upon firmness in face of Communist pressure. If we are weak here we will
							pay for it in the form of Communist aggression elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>On the Panmunjom issue, Park feared <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
								Il-Sung</persName> would delay and stall the negotiations in order
							to humiliate the US and therefore <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
							He wished to know what the US would do under those circumstances in
							order to calm his people. He was worried and displeased by the
							indications by high officials that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							could have been in North Korean territorial waters and by Senator
							Mansfield's recommendations that the issue be submitted to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss>. These statements and the absence of
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> participation at Panmunjom
							aroused <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> suspicions about the
							negotiations. Nevertheless, he would not oppose the continuation of
							secret talks providing he had an assurance that infiltration would
							stop.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the lengthy discussion Vance calmly and sympathetically strove
							for a dialogue with the President, probed for specificity, pointed out
							the weakness and dangers of Park's options, explained US <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0403"/>policy, reiterated the commonality of
								US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> interests, warned of the
							dangers of precipitate and unilateral action, and sought for a common,
							satisfactory course of action.</p>
                        <p>While the jury remained out at the end of the session, the atmosphere was
							friendly and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s appeared to
							recognize that we would not agree to a policy of retaliation. Despite
							press reports to the contrary, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							did not raise issue of revision of Mutual Defense Treaty or of seeking
							to disengage from the operational control of CINCUNC. Clearly, however,
							we have much serious talk ahead of us before we will know the outcome of
							this mission. We will submit a draft communique tonight.<note n="3" xml:id="d176fn3">Telegram 4178 (<gloss target="#t_VANTO1">VANTO</gloss> 7) from Seoul, February 12, stated that the draft
								communique “will fall far short of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ambitions and a substantial wrangle is in the
								offing.” In telegram 114006 to Seoul (<gloss target="#t_TOVAN1">TOVAN</gloss> 20), February 12, the Department of State
								forwarded cleared language for use in the communique. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US) The Embassy later

                        <p>1. We assume that major North Korean purposes in stepping up <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> incidents, infiltration and sabotage,
							and staging Blue House raid were to unnerve South Koreans, get them to
							return their forces, or some of them, from Viet-Nam or inhibit them from
							sending additional forces.</p>
                        <p>2. If these assumptions correct, North Koreans would crow with victory if
							South Koreans fell into this trap. North Koreans would propa gandize <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0404"/>that rising popular dissension
							in South Korea forced the Pak government to give up plans to send more
							troops to Viet-Nam and even forced them to bring back South Korean
							forces to put down a popular uprising.</p>
                        <p>3. It follows from this thread of argument that when things settle down
							in South Korea, Pak could win a moral and psychological victory over
								<persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName>, show his
							contempt for Kim, and confidence in himself and his country, if he could
							announce that additional forces will be sent to Viet-Nam. If Pak stands
							firm in Viet-Nam, and avoids precipitate action in Korea all that North
							Koreans will have achieved will be greatly heightened worldwide
							understanding of North Korean harassment of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, large increase in US military assistance to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with resultant strengthening of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military and anti-infiltration forces,
							and augmentation of US deterrent forces in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>4. A second purpose of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName>
							in stepping up violence against North [South] Korea was to interrupt its
							social and economic progress. Since South Korean people support Park and
							are active in informing police and military of presence of strangers,
							the North Koreans have no chance of successfully establishing guerrilla
							units in the south. Raiders are nasty business, but no real threat to
							the stability of South Korea, since most of them are killed or
							captured.</p>
                        <p>5. The temptation to strike back in reprisal is understandable,<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2">During a February 12 meeting the Prime
								Minister told Vance that “the real issue is to determine what lies
								behind these two North Korean actions” and raised the question of
								“whether the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should delay
								making an appropriate response or whether it should ‘strike now at
								the source of the problem.'” (Telegram 4170 from Seoul, February 12;
								ibid.) Similarly, the Foreign Minister stated that the two incidents
								were of such seriousness as to be “tantamount to invoking the Mutual
								Defense Treaty.'” (Telegram 4171 from Seoul, February 12; ibid.)
								Vance made no direct response to those comments.</note> but it will
							produce no decisive outcome. The danger in retaliatory or punitive air
							attacks against North Korea is that they could invite air attacks
							against the South. If Pyongyang or other <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> site is hit, what is to prevent an attack against Seoul
							or some other site? Action and counter-action could lead to resumed
							fighting along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, but both sides
							are too strong to move successfully against each other in this area. The
							end result would be to call off the reprisal policy, after physical
							damage had been done to both sides and a period of fighting in the
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> with no decisive result (it
							would not end infiltration), or move to full scale war. None of these
							outcomes is in the South Korean or our interest.</p>
                        <p>6. We may in the end be forced to take reprisal actions, but they should
							be deliberate not hasty, and South Korea's defenses and cities should be
							prepared for the possible consequences.</p>
                        <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0405"/>
                        <p>7. South Korea has made magnificent economic, social and political
							progress in these last years. All this would be interrupted and
							endangered by an escalation of violence due to reprisals or limited war.
							Private American investors are already hesitating to move into South
							Korea until the situation clarifies. Is not the best course, therefore,
							to return to the uneasy situation that existed prior to the seizure of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the Blue House raid, strengthen
							further the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> capacity to deal with
							raiders, and make it even more costly to the North, strengthen the
							military arm of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, keep a stronger
							US force in the area if tension persists as an additional warning and
							deterrent, send the new Korean forces into Viet-Nam, and continue with
							South Korea's economic and social progress.</p>
                        <p>8. Assume you are thinking along the same lines, but we pass them to you
							for your consideration.</p>

                        <p>4207. <gloss target="#t_VANTO1">VANTO</gloss> 8. Cyrus Vance, accompanied
							by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>, John Walsh and
							Colonel Greenleaf met for 2 and 1/2 hours this morning with the Prime
							Minister, Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, Information Minister,
								<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director, and Chief <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Session was intense, frank, spirited,
							and we believe helpful to both sides. Under existing circumstances each
							side felt constrained to get certain issues out on the table. This was
							done without excessive rancor.</p>
                        <p>The discussion, which was identified by the Ministers as consultations
							under our joint mutual security treaty, ranged widely over varied
							aspects of US commitments and performance in the postwar world, the
							origins of the Korean War, US-Korean relations, US assistance to Korea,
							Korean participation in the Vietnam struggle, problems of Korean public
							opinion, Panmunjom Communist objectives, overt and covert Communist
							threats to Korea, and the tactics of dealing with indirect North Korean
							aggression. After several hours of give-and-take, the <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0406"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s expressed full confidence that the
							US would respond in the event of overt aggression and that further
							discussions would be limited to the problem of indirect aggression and
							the method of dealing with it.</p>
                        <p>Vance at this point said the next question to be addressed was whether it
							was possible to define in advance what degree of indirect aggression
							required counter reaction which of course carries with it the risk of
							war. Vance said he had long reflected on this problem and had concluded
							that it was impossible to do so. He had therefore concluded that the
							best course to pursue in the event of further incidents of indirect
							aggression is to consult and then jointly determine what action should
							be taken in light of all existing circumstances. Furthermore, he said,
							in our democracy we must operate under the Mutual Defense Treaty
							ratified by Congress. President can only take action under this treaty.
							For the moment, at least, the Koreans seemed to agree.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the meeting the Foreign Minister presented two documents to
							Vance, an “agreed minutes” and a “joint defense declaration.” These
							documents which are transmitted in septel raise most serious legal and
							funding issues.<note n="2" xml:id="d178fn2">The texts of the documents
								were transmitted in telegram 4208 from Seoul, February 13.
								(Ibid.)</note> After pointing out the serious legal problems
							embodied in these documents, Vance agreed to study them and discuss them
							in a meeting scheduled for tomorrow. We intend reject these documents
							for the reasons cited and endeavor reach agreement on the draft
							communique contained State's 114006—<gloss target="#t_VANTO1">VANTO</gloss> 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">See <ref target="#d176fn3">footnote 3, Document 176</ref>.</note> We

                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Kim, General Im, CJCS, and several
							of their staff assistants. The meeting, which was again frank and
							candid, seemed to result in tacit agreement by the Koreans that the
							“joint defense statement” and “agreed minutes” which they tabled
							yesterday were not negotiable (see Seoul 4208). Although their reaction
							was subdued when Vance tabled our draft communique (State 114006),<note n="4" xml:id="d179fn4">See <ref target="#d176fn3">footnote 3,
									Document 176</ref>.</note> they did not take issue with its
							substance in part because the Prime Minister clearly intends to submit
							it to President Park.</p>
                        <p>The most significant exchanges took place in a short private session
							between Vance, <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, Prime
							Minister and principal Presidential Secretary Yi Hu-rak. At this
							session, Prime Minister recommended that Vance meet alone with President
							Park and explain to him that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> has grave domestic problems, similar to Park's
							and two President's should stand together at this time. Yi Hu-rak and
								<persName>Chung</persName> urged Vance to make clear to Park that he
							must not take unilateral action against North Korea. Such action would
							only destroy the economy and hopes of Korea. Furthermore, Vance should
							emphasize to Park that unilateral action would seriously endanger
							continuing US support.</p>
                        <p>When <persName>Chung</persName> stated that National Assembly pressure
							might force his government to withdraw their troops from Vietnam, Vance
							told him flatly we would reciprocate by withdrawing our troops from
							Korea. He gasped, sputtered and immediately went out and brought Yi
							Hu-rak into the meeting. Vance also made it quite clear to the Prime
							Minister that, if we fail to reach agreement on the issues before us,
							there would be serious US domestic reactions in respect to Korea.</p>

							Minister would convey this afternoon to the Mission the Cabinet's

							by <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, would meet with
							President Park tomorrow morning, hopefully at 1000 hours.</p>

									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/VANCE)</note> was in
							dramatic contrast with the meeting I had with Pak and the Cabinet when I
							arrived in Seoul. Tensions were high when I arrived. When I left, Pak
							put his arm around me and thanked me for coming. In terms of the basic
							objectives of easing tension and getting a friendly relationship
							re-established, the mission was a success. This was in evidence even
							with the press at the airport when I left.</p>
                        <p>In the long run, however, the picture is very dangerous.</p>
                        <p>The President: Before we get any further, what did we do to provoke the
							anger and hostility?</p>
                        <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0409"/>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Because we did not permit any retaliatory action on the attack
							on Blue House. The depth of feeling over that is very deep. It was
							considered a personal affront and a loss of face. They considered it
							very serious that the raiders got within 300 yards of Blue House bent
							upon killing the President and his family.</p>
                        <p>The President: Does Pak blame us for that?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Yes, to some extent, because they got through the guards.</p>
                        <p>Pak wanted to react violently against North Korea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> prevented this.</p>
                        <p>Blue House is now covered with guards and there are strict orders that
							any plane, no matter what its designation, will be shot down if it flies
							anywhere over or around Blue House.</p>
                        <p>They are also angry about the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. They wanted
							us to take out Wonsan and not doing so was in their opinion a loss of
							face.</p>
                        <p>One of their guys, the Defense Minister, is an absolute menace. He has
							organized a very elite anti-infiltration unit under his command which
							has been conducting raids across the border against North Korea.</p>
                        <p>So there is blame on all sides.</p>
                        <p>There is a very strong danger of unilateral action by Pak.</p>
                        <p>Pak controls the whole country. Nobody will tell him what he does not
							want to hear. He is moody, volatile and has been drinking heavily. He is
							a danger and rather unsafe.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister is a force for restraint. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> called in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Joint Chiefs and made it completely
							clear to them that if any unilateral action is taken that it would
							necessitate him recommending that U.S. troops be withdrawn.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>'s report of the

								February 1968 to March 1968)</note> The Chiefs took this very
							calmly. The Prime Minister told me to make it clear to President Pak
							that he can't take unilateral action. There are a few men at the top who
							are aware of this danger.</p>
                        <p>Pak presents us with some problems. I do not know whether he will stand
							still. We went into some gut issues in our meeting with <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and Pak. We got some
							commitments:</p>
                        <p>1. That they will take action to quiet their people.</p>
                        <p>2. They will stand by during the closed door sessions with North Korea as
							long as it doesn't go on for a long period of time.</p>
                        <p>3. There will be no reprisals for the Blue House or <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>4. There will be no reprisals in the future without consulting us if they

                        <p>5. The most serious thing was this. They said they will go through the

                        <p>There was an understanding that they would keep their troops in South

								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/VANCE) Vance raised several
								questions that the Department referred to Westmoreland for response.
								Vance met with Pak prior to receiving answers from Westmoreland and
								therefore did not discuss the redeployment of Korean troops in
								Vietnam while he was in Seoul. (Telegrams 4210 from Seoul, February
								13, and 114980 to Seoul, February 14; both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I made it very clear to Pak that were they even to consider removing
							troops from South Vietnam we would pull ours out of Korea.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the prospects for the future are not good.</p>
                        <p>—North Korea may try to get South Korea to take some unilateral action
							against the North to further divide us.</p>
                        <p>—There is an unstable political situation with Pak's mood and attitude as
							it is.</p>
                        <p>—There could be a serious problem raised with the possibility of
							unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>—I do not know if Pak will last. In the past, South Korea has been a
							showcase for the United States, but we must look at the cold hard facts.
							There is no longer a perfect showcase.</p>
                        <p>I would recommend that a good, small group be put together to determine
							how we proceed in the days ahead.</p>
                        <p>That is my report in capsule form.</p>
                        <p>The President: Is Pak's drinking irrationally something new?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No, this has been going on for some time. He hit his wife with
							an ash tray. He has thrown ash trays at several of his assistants and I
							was fully prepared for that.</p>
                        <p>The President: What does he want us to give him?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: He has a large shopping list. He wants:</p>
                        <p>—Six squadrons of F–4s.</p>
                        <p>—One million dollars to augment his anti-guerrilla forces.</p>
                        <p>—Four new air fields.</p>
                        <p>—Expansion of existing air bases.</p>
                        <p>—A large increase in the amount of aid.</p>
                        <p>—A promise to remove none of the air craft now in South Korea until the
							new ones he has requested are in place.</p>

                        <p>I told him I would pass this on to you.<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">Although Pak had insisted on official recognition of these
								requests, Vance and the Foreign Minister agreed merely to exchange
								letters noting the requests had been made. (Telegram 4243 from
								Seoul, February 15; ibid.)</note> The amount comes to about $1–1/2
							billion.</p>
                        <p>The President: What do you think the consequences are of the 600 raids
							that have taken place this year? Have they hurt the South Koreans
							much?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No, not except for the Blue House raid.</p>
                        <p>The President: Was the Blue House raid intended for our Ambassador
							too?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No. The one infiltrator who was captured was told to say that
							he was after Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>.
							But he really wasn't. He was told that before <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> and our interrogators got to him in order to put a
							little more political pressure on us to act.</p>
                        <p>The President: Did the South Koreans say what brought the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> attack on?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Nothing more than they thought this was part of a North Korean
							political plan to destroy morale and to harm us and the South
							Koreans.</p>
                        <p>The President: Have they asked for any more U.S. troops?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No.</p>
                        <p>The President: Did they say anything about Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No, they did not.</p>
                        <p>The President: Was there any criticism about Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No, they said their resolve was the same as it had always
							been.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Did Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> say we would pull out
							our troops in South Korea if they pull out their troops from
							Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No, I do not know if Porter said that. I made it clear to Pak
							that he should not persist in that attitude. I told him that any talk of
							that would have grave impact on the future of relations of our two
							countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: If we had started
							this consultation earlier, would we have had all these problems? Or were
							they inherent in Pak before this happened?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: They were inherent in the situation with Pak.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Do
							they continue to think we should take Wonsan?</p>
                        <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0412"/>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Yes, they went through a list of things with me that they
							would do if certain events were to happen.</p>
                        <p>The President: Doesn't Pak worry about what the Soviets or the Chinese
							might do?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Pak thinks the Soviets and the Chinese will stand aside. I
							told him that our judgment and his judgment on this matter were vastly
							different.</p>
                        <p>Pak is convinced that the North Koreans are going to try to take over
							South Korea by 1970. He said that if they tried to attack Blue House
							again that he would retaliate and that much blood would be shed and that
							there would be much pain and suffering.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: How about our
							[their?] raids into the North?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: They are conducting about two a month.</p>
                        <p>The President: Do we have a clear idea of what they have done?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: They have been operating two a month raids recently. The
							anti-infiltration units are under the command of the Defense Minister.
							They took out a division headquarters in recent attacks. An attack no
							later than March is planned across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> again.</p>
                        <p>There is much talk in military circles about this.</p>
                        <p>The numbers are not clear. They have about 200 anti-infiltration troops
							trained with each division upon the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
							and have an additional group being trained by these men now.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, there are some highly trained guerrilla units. They
							estimate there are 2400 of these in 30 man teams. They are well trained
							and tough, but they have been chopped up in the past. 80 to 90% of them
							have been eliminated, since the South Koreans turned them in
							quickly.</p>
                        <p>They have excellent cooperation from the people in turning these
							guerrillas in. The exact number of South Koreans trained is a very
							closely held secret.</p>
                        <p>The President: Is there any connection in your mind between the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the attacks in Vietnam? Is there one
							man calling the dance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: I am not clear as to the case.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Now that we have
							made a case of the 570 raids across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> aren't we in a difficult position if any of this
							information comes to light about South Korean raids into the North?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We do not
							have adequate knowledge of this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Here is a list of items right here. There have been eleven
							raids between 26 October and December.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President: When did they start?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: I do not know, although I think it has been at least a
							year.</p>
                        <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0413"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> had rumors of
							this from his advisors who are with the Korean units. Hard information
							is difficult to get.</p>
                        <p>The President: What is the purpose of these raids?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: They are
							punitive.</p>
                        <p>The President: Are any of our soldiers doing any of this?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: No, sir. It is
							routine that battalions go into the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
							and behind the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> under the Armistice
							Agreement. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>
							has talked to the Senior <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Commanders
							about the dangers of this action.</p>
                        <p>We could not even prove these raids have taken place.</p>
                        <p>The President: I would just as soon not prove it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: There are going to be some problems. Only recently a unit took
							an M–79 grenade launcher with them. If the North Koreans have it, they
							may make some propaganda out of it.</p>
                        <p>The President: Have there been any complaints from the North Koreans?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: There have been
							some on the radio and at the meetings at Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: What about the
							public unrest?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: The unrest is deep and real.</p>
                        <p>The people are personally offended. In the South Korean General Assembly,
							there is talk that we do not have as strong a mutual security pact with
							South Korea as we do with the Philippines. This particularly relates to
							incident response. They wanted a commitment from me on that. They feel
							like they have a second class arrangement. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s also feel their hands are tied since they are under
							the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command.</p>
                        <p>I met with the Speaker and the leaders of their Congress. They brought
							this up. There is some feeling in the populace about this issue.</p>
                        <p>The President: Is there any estimate of what you would recommend in the
							additional assistance?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: For next year, I would think about $200 million would be
							required. They need to increase their capability to take care of
							guerrilla-type raids in order to contain things rapidly.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> believes
							more can be done. In addition, we have to give them some F–4s. They must
							have this for public consumption.</p>
                        <p>But I made it clear that there was nothing in the woods beyond the $100
							million this year.</p>
                        <p>They do need strengthening in a number of areas. The dilemma we face is
							how much we build them up, how much we build up their strike
							capacity.</p>
                        <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We had the same
							problem with Syngman Rhee 20 years ago. How much do we give him when he
							is having to strike the North?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: I am most
							distressed about President Pak's instability. Does he have power to
							start major action on his own?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: The generals would let us know and would drag their feet. But
							if he said go, they would have to go.</p>
                        <p>One general told General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> that he was terrified of the possibility of
							unilateral action, but he said that if he is given the order, they will
							have to respond.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: This is a weak
							reed we are leaning on. We must watch this with the greatest care. We
							have got to find a means to disengage ourselves from any possibility of
							unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: President Pak will issue all sorts of orders when he begins
							drinking. His generals will delay any action on them until the next
							morning. If he says nothing about those orders the following morning
							then they just forget what he had told them the night before.</p>
                        <p>The President: Where do we get this information from?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>
							gets it. The military have the greatest amount of respect for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander and for his position.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: Is there any
							quarrel between Pak and his Congress?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Not that I know of.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>: Are the South Koreans
							developing their own teams?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: They are called AIUs (anti-infiltration units). They have 2400
							men. Beyond that, they have one airborne battalion with jump capability.
							They could be dropped in for guerrilla activity. If a war starts, they
							would be parachuted in to harass the movement of supplies and
							munitions.</p>
                        <p>They have teams for each Province.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: Did you get any
							threat at all, even a veiled threat, about withdrawing troops from South
							Vietnam?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: The Prime Minister mentioned that the legislature might ask
							for that. I told him very bluntly that we would remove our troops from
							South Korea if that happened. The Prime Minister turned ashen. It really
							shook him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: Then you think
							they are clear on that?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Yes.</p>
                        <p>The President: Walt, do you have anything?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President: What is the status of their Naval craft?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: They need more to impede infiltration. Most of the
							infiltration comes in from the sea.</p>
                        <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0415"/>
                        <p>The Vice President: Did you detect any political rivalry between Pak and
							the Defense Minister?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: No.</p>
                        <p>The President: Who is watching the situation on our behalf?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> is
							watching the President. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> will step in at any time.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: As I understand
							it, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> focuses
							on the Defense Minister and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Joint Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>: It goes back 20
							years when the military was a restraining force against Syngman Rhee.
							The senior military will talk frankly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: That is why we meet with them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I got a reassuring
							feeling from your meeting this morning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: They did say what I consider a very serious thing. If there is
							a serious incident, they will consult but they will go ahead and take
							action.</p>
                        <p>The President: Then you feel pretty well about it all?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vance: Except for the last point.</p>
                        <p>The President: Do our people feel that they are pretty well prepared out
							there?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Yes, sir, but we
							will be doing several things to improve our situation. But, with our Air
							Force out there, with their ground troops, and with the improvements in
							the ammunition supplies, the troops in South Korea could do quite
							well.</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Objectives of My Mission</p>
                        <p>Under the broad delegation of authority given me, I formulated the
							specific objectives of my Mission in the following terms:</p>
                        <p>“The objective of my Mission is to persuade President Park, and through
							him the Korean Government, that we intend to stand firmly with them in
							the current crisis and that our policy for handling the developing
							situation is soundly based. It is necessary to establish a sufficient
							level of Korean confidence in the United States to permit the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to provide the Mission with adequate
							assurances that (1) the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will take
							no independent military actions against North Korea; (2) the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> will dampen down public agitation for
							retaliatory actions; and (3) the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							will consent to our private bilateral discussions with the North Koreans
							of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> issue in order that the crew and
							ship will be promptly released.</p>
                        <p>I believe that these objectives were essentially realized. I have no
							illusions, however, of the necessity of wise and painstaking follow-up
							action by our able representatives in Seoul, working in closest
							coordination with Washington. We must not permit the Communists to
							separate us from President Park and his Government—that is the publicly
							stated objective of Pyongyang. The situation in Korea remains acutely
							dangerous to our national interest and to peace in that area.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Situation in Seoul</p>
                        <p>When I arrived in Seoul on 11 February, I found a fragile and serious
							political situation, pockmarked with tension, suspicion, and
							distrust.</p>
                        <p>President Park was in a highly emotional state. He was incensed over the
							North Korean raid on 21 January against the Presidential <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0417"/>Mansion (the Blue House) and the
							seizure of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> on 23 January. He held
							the United States partially to blame for the Blue House raid since the
							North Korean strike team had infiltrated across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> in an area defended by U.S. forces. He
							considered the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> as an
							affront to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> since, to him, it
							demonstrated the impotence of the U.S. and South Korea to thwart such
							actions.</p>
                        <p>Park doubted both the resolve of the United States and her commitment in
							Korea, partially because of U.S. involvement in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and partially because of alleged delays in providing
							military equipment to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
							forces and in modernizing those forces. He objected to the bilateral
							discussions at Panmunjom between U.S. and North Korean representatives
							since he considered them demeaning to the U.S. and therefore to the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. He also felt that the
							discussions infringed on ROK sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>Park is a distinctive leader who has wrought much good for his people.
							However, the raid on the Blue House had unfortunate psychologic effects
							on him. He felt that both he and his country had lost face and his fears
							for his own safety and that of his family were markedly increased.
							Compounding this problem has been his heavy drinking. This is not a new
							development but it may be having cumulative effects. Highly emotional,
							volatile, frustrated and introspective, Park wanted to obtain from me a
							pledge for the United States to join his Government in instant,
							punitive, and retaliatory actions against North Korea in the event of
							another Blue House raid or comparable attack on some other important
							South Korean economic, governmental, or military facility. He wanted my
							assurance of an “automatic” U.S. response in the event of another
							serious raid against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. I refused
							to give any such assurances. Park's views were mirrored by almost every
							member of his Cabinet, who, while now civilians, are mostly retired
							colonels and generals.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Meetings with Koreans</p>
                        <p>In my meetings with the Koreans, I included Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> as members of my Mission
							not only in recognition of their high competence but also in hope of
							emphasizing the importance of their positions and their stature as your
							representatives.</p>
                        <p>In subsequent days, I had two meetings with President Park (which took
							about seven hours); two meetings with the Prime Minister and other key
							members of the Government (Foreign Minister, Minister of National
							Defense, Minister of Public Information, Director of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Joint Chiefs of Staff, and their
							principal staff assistants); and two meetings with the Foreign Minister
							and members of his staff, including a ten-hour meeting over the wording
							and contents <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0418"/>of the final Joint
							Communique, a copy of which is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> In all of our meetings with the
							Koreans, we listened attentively to everything they had to say and
							endeavored to draw out of them the totality of their views, opinions,
							and concerns.</p>
                        <p>With one significant exception, we placed the onus on them to raise
							topics for discussion. The exception concerned South Korean forays
							across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> into the North. This
							information was news to most members of the Cabinet since the South
							Korean infiltration units are under the personal control of Minister of
							National Defense Kim and their activities are closely held secrets
							within the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>. We emphasized the
							provocative nature of these attacks, which, over the past several
							months, have averaged two per month. We suggested that some of the more
							serious North Korean incursions into the South may have been launched in
							retaliation for South Korean raids, in particular the November 1967 raid
							against a North Korean Peoples Army Divisional Headquarters. The
							Headquarters was apparently blown up and the twelve-man South Korean
							strike team exfiltrated without sustaining any casualties. We pointed
							out that there was no evidence that the South Korean forays had had a
							chastening effect on <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim
							Il-Sung</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Just prior to my departure President Park, the Prime Minister, and the
							Foreign Minister were most pleasant and friendly. The Foreign Minister,
							his principal staff assistants, the Secretary General of the Office of
							the President, and the Chief of Protocol also came to bid me goodbye at
							Kimpo in a complete reversal of the cool reception which greeted me on
							my arrival.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Observations and Results</p>
                        <p>I believe that the limited objectives of my mission were realized.
							President Park will not retaliate for the Blue House raid. The bilateral
							discussions between the U.S. and North Korea at Panmunjom will not be
							impeded by the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, providing they do
							not drag on for months. Korean press agitation against the U.S. will be
							dampened. No request was made for removing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Korea from under the operational control of
							General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> as
							Commander in Chief of the United Nations Command. The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has been assured that we intend to
							help South Korea in modernizing its counter-insurgency and
							counter-infiltration forces and facilities.</p>
                        <p>I believe that a necessary measure of confidence and trust has been
							re-established. The immediate threat of a serious dispute between the
							United States and the Republic of Korea has been eased. The prospects of
							the South Koreans initiating in the near future unilateral retaliatory
								<pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0419"/>actions against North Korea
							in response to infiltration of suicide or strike teams by boat and
							across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> into South Korea have
							diminished. Yet, in the longer term, the prospects of the ROKG
							initiating a unilateral attack against North Korea are troublesome,
							ominous, and dangerous.</p>
                        <p>While President Park assured me that he would first consult with the
							United States before taking any action if North Korea again mounts an
							attack on the Presidential Mansion, or against some equally important
							South Korean facility, he would not guarantee to heed our counsel if we
							recommended against retaliation. If counter-actions by the Republic of
							Korea resulted in the outbreak of war with North Korea, the lives of
							some 12,000 American civilians (most of whom are located in the vicinity
							of Seoul) would be immediately endangered. Similarly, since U.S.
							aircraft are parked wing to wing on the six <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> airfields and American military forces are deployed
							along a key portion of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>—to the
							West and North of Seoul and across two of the most likely attack routes
							into South Korea—the prospects of American troops becoming immediately
							involved in combat with North Korean forces are extremely high.</p>
                        <p>The outbreak of war in Korea could thus be ignited either by a serious
							North Korean incursion into the South or by a South Korean foray into
							the North.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials are preoccupied with the
							North Korean threat as they see it. Some of them believe that the
							situation today is very similar to that which existed in June 1950.
							While the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has emphasized economic
							development over the last few years, the North Koreans have emphasized
							military preparedness. The North Koreans have taken a number of steps to
							improve their offensive and defensive military capabilities. Underground
							facilities have been built for munitions storage and ammunition
							production. North Korean airfields have been expanded and revetments
							constructed for the protection of aircraft. Civil defense exercises are
							regularly held and a well-trained Red Guard has been formed. Food stocks
							have been augmented. With the help of the Soviets, military equipment
							has been modernized and new armored vehicles, aircraft, SAMs and
							artillery weapons introduced into the operational inventory.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps more important to understanding the current attitudes of
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials, North Korean
							Premier <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName> has
							intensified his propaganda campaign against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and has publicly declared that by 1970 he will reunite
							Korea by force.</p>
                        <p>As a companion effort to his anti-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							propaganda campaign, <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName>
							has established an infiltration force of some 20,000 men, including 2400
							specially trained soldiers who operate in small reconnaissance/stroke
							teams of seven to thirty-one men each. Last year a <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0420"/>number of these teams were landed along
							the East and West coasts of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> by
							high speed (35 to 40 knots) infiltration boats which can carry up to 40
							equipped men each. North Korea presently has 25 to 40 of these
							boats.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, in turn, is organizing and
							training its own infiltration force, and, as noted earlier, has made a
							number of forays across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> into
							North Korea. In this connection we were impressed with the thought that
							ethnic Koreans comprise the populations of both Koreas and that there
							are few “doves” or “hawks” among them; most appear to be “tigers”. It
							also appears true that a substantial percentage of Koreans, north and
							south, share a latent and compulsive desire to reunite their
							country.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is controlled by one man—Park.
							With the possible exception of Secretary General Yi Hu Rak, no
							governmental official seems willing to challenge Park or offer him
							tempered advice. Minister of National Defense Kim is impulsive and has
							little capacity to think through the possible political and military
							consequences of his policies and actions.</p>
                        <p>Throughout our meetings with the Koreans we often heard them comment on
							their inability to contain North Korean infiltration teams. The South
							Koreans are fearful that a North Korean strike/reconnaissance team will
							destroy some major economic facility, e.g., a refinery or a dam. It
							seemed to us that the Koreans lack confidence in their own political,
							economic and military achievements. Whatever the cause, be it their
							short history as a nation or their relative inexperience with economic
							development, the Koreans time and time again demonstrated their
							insecurity and lack of self-confidence.</p>
                        <p>We should consider what steps we could take to bolster their confidence
							in themselves. For example, we should strive to maintain the private
							investment momentum generated by the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Mission. We should push ahead with the task of
							strengthening their anti-infiltration system by expediting the flow of
							equipment, making available to General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> our most competent military personnel and
							techniques in the anti-infiltration field, continue modernization of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces, and call an early
							meeting of the Defense Ministries as provided for in the Joint
							Communique.</p>
                        <p>The appetite of the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> for additional
							U.S. military assistance is very large as evidenced by my attached
							letter to Foreign Minister <persName>Choi</persName> which notes the
							requirements for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> as Park and his
							ministers see them. My specific recommendations in respect to these
							Korean requests are also attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d181fn3"> Vance's
								letter and recommendations are attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0421"/>
                        <p>A major possible restraining force in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> today is the military whose chiefs understand the
							dangers inherent in the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> initiating
							unilateral action against North Korea. Yet, these same chiefs, while
							willing to keep General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> apprised of the orders received from Park,
							would probably comply with President Park's orders.</p>
                        <p>By agreeing to the issuance of a Joint Communique, after initial
							resistance, President Park is now committed to consult with us whenever
							he considers his country has been threatened. His freedom of action has
							therefore been somewhat reduced. However, his position on retaliation
							remains unsatisfactory. While he has been clearly warned of the grave
							consequences of taking retaliatory action, he has not accepted the full
							significance of this warning, nor does he, in my judgment, attach
							adequate importance to the Mutual Defense Treaties which North Korea has
							with Communist China and the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>I must also add that Park and his ministers made a number of demands
							which I rejected. I refused to commit the United States to an “agreed
							retaliation policy” involving “instant, punitive, retaliatory action”
							against future North Korean violations of the Armistice Agreement. I
							also refused to extend or modify the terms of the US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Mutual Defense Treaty, and I refused to
							agree to a suggested secret minute that would have committed the U.S. to
							an “automatic retaliatory response,” as the Koreans repeatedly asserted
							Secretary Dulles had promised the Philippines in 1958.</p>
                        <p>Further, I refused to endorse the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							request that U.S. military assistance program to Korea should be greatly
							expanded. I insisted on reserving the responsibility of determining what
							recommendations I would submit to you. I made it clear that I attached a
							far higher priority to improving the counter-infiltration capabilities
							of the ROK military forces than purchasing six squadrons of F–4s or
							other high performance aircraft. Furthermore, I warned the President,
							the Cabinet and the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
							of the severe financial consequences and the disruptive effect on
							balanced force structures of the introduction of this magnitude of
							advanced aircraft into their inventory.</p>
                        <p>While I did not raise the issue of dispatching additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to Vietnam, I made it clear that
							we expected the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to remain in
							the RNV. President Park personally assured me that he would not withdraw
							any <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. I in turn reassured the
							Koreans that the obligation of the United States under the Mutual
							Security Treaty would be met.</p>
                        <p>In my discussions with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> concerning the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							negotiations, I was told of the great problems involved in passing
							messages between the Embassy, General Bone- steel's headquarters and the
							U.S. element at Panmunjom. Instructions to our Panmunjom delegation
							received at the Embassy must be immedi ately <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0422"/>translated into Korean so that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s interpreter can read them
							into the official record. When weather permits the use of a helicopter
							from Seoul to Panmunjom, the total time from receipt of the message at
							the Embassy to delivery to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> averages 2–1/2 hours. Again, with good flying
							weather, it normally takes about 3 hours from the end of a negotiation
							session until a message can be dispatched to Washington. When bad
							weather prevents helicopter flight, another two or three hours must be
							added to the processing of both incoming and outgoing messages.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I found a highly unsatisfactory communication system in
							Seoul and between Seoul and Washington. With the approval of Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Under Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, we have now
							installed full teleconferencing and secure telephone facilities between
							the two capitals and within Seoul.</p>
                        <p>Before closing this report, I have certain recommendations I would like
							to make.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, I believe that a small
								State/Defense/<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/White House study
							group should be established to undertake an independent assessment of
							our current policy toward the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and to
							identify what our political, economic and military objectives in Korea
							should be over the next several years. This study effort should also
							assess the current and future policies of North Korea vis-e-vis the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. I consider it extremely
							important that this study group should be formed at a level in
							Government where its recommendations can be reviewed first-hand by our
							most senior policy-makers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, I believe that serious consideration
							should be given to apprising the Soviets of the dangerous political
							situation that exists in Korea on both sides of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and the pitfalls it offers for our two
							countries should North or South Korea sponsor a major raid which could
							result in war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, I believe that consideration should be
							given to exposing at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and through
							bilateral exchanges the full dimensions of <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName>'s actions against South Korea and their
							implications for area and world peace. I must point out, however, that
							this course of action is not without danger because of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> guerrilla raids on North Korea which
							could well be surfaced.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, I believe that beginning in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1969 the basic military assistance
							program to Korea should be increased from $160 to $200 or $210 million
							per year. Approximately 85 per cent of the Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program is expended for the maintenance
							of existing Korean forces and these costs are rising. The amount of
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funding available for investment
							or force modernization is therefore but a fraction of the total program.
							A sizeable portion of these additional funds, as well as of the $100
							million supplemental assistance you have requested of the <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0423"/>Congress for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>-1968, should be used for improving the
							counter-insurgency and counter-infiltration capabilities of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Fifth</hi>, I believe that consideration should be
							given to the problem of providing additional protection for our [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
							weapons sites.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Sixth</hi>, I believe that consistent with the Joint
							Communique, Ministerial meetings between the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Ministry of National Defense and the Department of
							Defense should be promptly arranged. Similarly, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> should be given standby
							authority to extend an invitation to Prime Minister
								<persName>Chung</persName> to visit the United States later this
							year if, in his judgment, such a visit would be useful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Seventh</hi>, I believe that consideration should be
							given to improving the Korean <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
							barrier.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Eighth</hi>, I strongly recommend that arrangements
							should be instituted which would permit General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> to apprise Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> monthly of all
							approved U.S. reconnaissance activities scheduled for the vicinity of
							Korea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> did not
							know of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> mission.</p>
                        <p>My final comments concern Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>, General Bone- steel, and the members of my
							mission, Mr. John P. Walsh, Colonel Abbott C. Greenleaf and Mr. Daniel
							O'Donohue.</p>
                        <p>Both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> are outstanding
							public servants. They are highly competent and are working very hard and
							courageously in a very difficult political situation which could turn
							sour overnight. They are entitled to commendation and our full
							support.</p>
                        <p>As for the members of my Mission, I cannot praise too highly the truly
							outstanding performance of Mr. John Walsh and Colonel Abbott Greenleaf
							under very difficult conditions. Their ever wise counsel and tireless

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>1. I think there are several lessons we should draw from events of the
							past month. We have tended to be pleased about economic progress in
							South Korea over the past few years, and our satisfaction at this has to
							some degree obscured the fact that we have concurrently been nourishing
							a tiger, which is becoming difficult to restrain and confine: It looks
							to me now as though Park's desire to go north is not much less acute
							than his adversary's intention, some day, to move south. As you know we
							had a difficulty with Syngman Rhee, too, at one point, back about 1954,
							when he thought the moment had come; but since that year we have
							gradually allowed ourselves to ignore the implications of our military
							aid policy in this country.</p>
                        <p>2. It is as clear as day that both sides are now preparing to have quite
							a slapping match during the coming Spring and Summer. Let's hope we can
							keep it at that level, though the effect of a major humiliation for one
							or the other in the form of a successful assassination or demolition
							will be hard to contain. In such event, we here know whom we will go for
							and, while we do not have from you yet any comment on useful restraints
							to impose on our friends, you may be sure that we will use everything
							that seems necessary in the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>3. The moment of danger in these matters comes, not a week or ten days
							later, but during the twenty-four to forty-eight hours immediately
							following the incident, when the elements of humiliation, face,
							criticism and anger prevail. One may ask for a special envoy later, but
							the immediate problem is to apply and maintain restraint. The purpose of
							the envoy, as I saw it, was to get across to Park, from President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> himself, that there
							was no likelihood of our following them into blind, emotion-packed
							reprisals, and of course, I wanted to subject someone with ready access
							to our President to the kind of gut reaction that I was encountering. It
							was not difficult for Vance to evoke from Park, who was only too
							cooperative in this sense, all that was needed to enable him to carry
							home a clear personal account of the danger. Vance <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0425"/> is a cool, practical person, and it
							was a pleasure for both <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> and me to work with him.</p>
                        <p>4. The immediate aftermath of the Vance visit has been a lessening of
							tension. The President vented his spleen, a special envoy was sent by
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, $100 million
							more were in the kitty, and Park feels secure in the knowledge that he
							is probably right—the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>'s will try
							again, perhaps even while they diddle us with the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> affair. The President is not churning up press or
							public the way he was a couple of weeks ago, but he is not letting them
							forget, either, that he has warned the United States that our policies
							will encourage <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il Sung</persName> to
							believe that more activity can be safely carried on. While he and the
							Government have allowed things to simmer down, please understand that
								<hi rend="italic">there is no fundamental change in their outlook or
								their intentions</hi>. The military chiefs closely imitate the
							President's attitude, but there is much muttering and rumbling at the
							middle levels. The exercise now for the Bureau, if I may say so, is to
							think out ways and means of transforming the tiger from one which would
							take over the northern jungle, to one which would defend his own den,
							and I would begin with fuel and ammunition supplies while giving special
							attention to the type of hardware flowing into this country.<note n="2" xml:id="d182fn2">In a March 4 memorandum transmitting this letter to
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
									<persName>Bundy</persName> doubted the United States could
								control such deliveries “to exert any leverage on South Korean
								retaliatory impulses,” but added that he would discuss the matter
								with the Department of Defense and others. (Ibid.) In late March the
								Department of State considered transferring ground ammunition worth
								as much as $100 million to Korean forces, but <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> opposed that action and
								advocated periodically supplying the Koreans with limited amounts of
								ammunition. (Telegram 138433 to Seoul, March 29, and telegram 5410
								from Seoul, April 1; both in National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, DEF 19–8 US–KOR
							</note> One of the remarkable things about Korea, something closely
							connected with American sentimentality, is that it is almost impossible
							to control, or even be consulted about, great quantities of aid that
							flow into the country.</p>
                        <p>5. Then there is the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> palaver, which causes
							as much disquiet among allies for its ineffectiveness, as it does in our
							consciences for its humiliating character. It is a curious thing that
							while we permit ourselves to be the victims of a policy of
							provocation-short-of-war, we do not use the same tactics against those
							who strike the first blow. It is becoming clear that the short-of-war
							formula is a masterful one, which can slowly but surely erode such
							prestige as we have. In the modern world, we are caught between the
							power of nuclear weapons, which world opinion forbids us to use, and the
							art of guerrilla warfare in which we are uninstructed. Our conventional
							arms cannot, as I think many now see somewhat more clearly, prevail over
							the latter. And where conventional air-sea (as distinct from land) arms
							could be used <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0426"/>in limited,
							appropriate fashion to discourage those who harass us, this is ruled out
							by the belief at home that our people, lulled by creature comforts, will
							prefer no-reaction-at-any-cost. And our people will prefer that, I
							think, until events make clear that it is their children who will pay
							the piper. No sensible person would advocate general war in retaliation
							for a <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, but it is clear that measures short
							of war could evoke, if not immediate satisfaction in this specific case,
							some caution on the part of our adversaries that in future might spare
							us similar experience.</p>
                        <p>6. I hope the Bureau was better informed about the location of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> than I was. Certainly, even I, with my
							limited technical knowledge and perhaps limited political understanding,
							would have promptly moved such a vessel out of waters contiguous to
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> after the Blue House raid. I will
							go so far as to say that technical knowledge of the field in which they
							were working would have led me vehemently to question the need for
							putting them into such waters in the first place. The moral here is
							quite clear: We should be told what is floating around, or over, or
							through, our areas of responsibility. We just might have something to
							contribute which could save us a deal of trouble. I went over this
							rather thoroughly with Cy Vance, and I think the message has been
							delivered.</p>
                        <p>7. I will spare you lengthy comment on Viet-Nam this month. There is no
							pleasure at all in assessing correctly that melancholy situation. But
							brace yourself, because more is coming. Too few seem to grasp that, to
							an enemy whose environment is the night, more men mean more compounds
							and therefore more big targets to hit. Sam's appointment as D.A.<note n="3" xml:id="d182fn3">

							needs in its present state of mind. He will be wrestling with a
							many-headed hydra, but it is an all-absorbing task, like none other in
							the Service. Undoubtedly he will be there during a very trying period,
							and I and all the others wish him Godspeed and success.</p>
                        <p>8. I hope to begin traveling toward the end of March, as I want to look
							over the anti-infiltration measures being taken along the coastline. As
							you may know, the problem is always to see what one wants to see, rather
							than what our friends want to show. But I think we'll manage.</p>
                        <p>9. As I consider the problem of restraining the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, I wonder whether I should invoke the assistance of
							Moon Myung, Founder and High Reverend of the Unification Church, into
							which he intends to absorb all other Christian churches, under his own
							spiritual guidance. (I hope he gives the Pope a job.)</p>
                        <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0427"/>
                        <p>The other day, Moon organized a mass wedding of members of his
							congregation—247 couples—at Citizen's Hall. Announcing from the stage
							that they should all consider themselves married, he then forbade them
							to engage in “love acts” for 40 days! When asked by reporters the reason
							for this “inhuman restraint,” Moon declared that it was necessary
							“because Christ prayed in the desert for 40 days and that's THAT!”</p>
                        <p>If I could only determine whether Moon's edict was obeyed (I have some
							doubts about it, myself) we might find a government post where he could
							exercise his ability to restrain their desire to go north—a much easier
							task than the one he set himself on the wedding day, I think!</p>

                        <p>1. The rapid development over the past week or ten days of the emphasis
							being placed on the homeland reserve by President Park is both
							interesting and significant.<note n="2" xml:id="d183fn2">On February 20
								the Korean Cabinet passed a decree implementing a 1961 law
								permitting establishment of a local reserve corps. The homeland
								reserve force was to be supervised by the Minister of National
								Defense, who could delegate authority to local police officials for
								use against armed infiltrators at the local level. (Airgram A–406
								from Seoul, February 26; National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–3 KOR S)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Beginnings of this emphasis appear to stem from events and discussions
							during Vance visit. Park's and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							total emphasis then was on retaliation and on need for vastly increased
								<gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, costing over a billion dollars.
							At that time we repeatedly pointed out there was a third area which
							needed attention and this was <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							self-help and <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0428"/>immediate
							improvement, using what they had now, of counter-infiltration resources
							(military and police) and internal security organization, augmented as
							feasible by incoming <gloss target="#t_CIGCOREP1">CIGCOREP</gloss> and
								<gloss target="#t_USOM1">USOM</gloss> aid. I pounded this theme also
							with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>
							and <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>. We pointed out that ROK with
							population of 30 million, very large armed forces and rapidly expanding
							national police was not exactly helpless in face of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> subversive threat. At same time <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s got some clear warnings that US was
							not going to be dragged into war precipitated by unilateral <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> “retaliation.”</p>
                        <p>3. For a long time <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have been greatly
							interested in Israel's defense organization, reserve forces, kibbutz,
								etc.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">Pak's first public statements
								addressing these themes came on February 7, when he announced plans
								to arm the nation's veterans and older reservists to always carry a
								rifle. The Embassy viewed Pak's comments skeptically, given the
								government's weapons-control policy and fear of assassination.
								(Telegram 4085 from Seoul, February 8; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 KOR S) A few days later the
								Defense Ministry announced an extension of the length of active
								service from 30 to 36 months in the army and marines and from 36 to
								42 months for the Navy and Air Force to meet internal security
								needs. (Telegram 4227 from Seoul, February 14; ibid.)</note> In last
							several weeks Israeli MA and several other Israelis have been seeing a
							lot of senior <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>4. Whatever is genesis of emphasis on using reserves or militia for
							internal security, President Park began to use the theme in speeches and
							press pronouncements beginning about ten days ago.<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">In a February 16 meeting between U.S. and Korean
								military authorities the Minister of National Defense expressed a
								similar interest in the Israeli approach of training and equipping
								its population to supplement regular armed forces and enhance its
								defenses. (Telegram 4311 from Seoul, February 17; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US/VANCE)</note> Precise theme
							has varied in details but generally stresses need for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s to build more self-reliant defenses,
							need for moral or “spiritual” reorientation of all citizens to realize
							defense of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, particularly against
							subversive and terrorist operations, is responsibility of all citizens
							and that they cannot ask allies to take care for them of this most
							elemental aspect of national existence. He has used “need for a more
							independent national defense” in some speeches, but at least for now, we
							do not interpret this to mean disengagement from UNC <gloss target="#t_OPCON1">OPCON</gloss> or any less dependence on US for
							help in defense of Korea against overt, large scale Communist
							aggression.</p>
                        <p>5. In terms of potential <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> threats
							against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> both from overt and from
							unconventional forces, I believe Park's approach makes sense. He is not,
							we think, derogating from US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							alliance and clearly hopes for continued <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support for modernization at about current levels to
							face overt threat, which he does not believe to be so imminent as
							subversive threat. At same time, however, he is now plugging to fight
							the subversive threat on maximum <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							self-help. He seems to <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0429"/>be
							trying to tighten the internal defenses and give them a greater and more
							cohesive capability to handle the many thousands of trained raiders and
							guerrilla teams which <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> has built up. He
							obviously does not want to risk <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							possible effort to harass interior of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> along lines North Vietnamese are trying in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of magnitude of dual threat—overt and covert—being built up by
							North Koreans and in light of great economic progress in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, not to mention huge investments of US
							in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in war and peace, I think
							President Park's new approach makes sense and is in US national interest
							as well as <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.<note n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">The Embassy also urged policymakers in Washington
								to fund the program. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>
								argued that Pak's commitment to the homeland reserve force
								represented a significant shift in his approach to the North Korean
								threat from retaliation to self-defense. (Telegram 4634 from Seoul,

                        <p>1. Events since last September tend to confirm the conclusions of SNIE
								14.2–67,<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">
                                <ref target="#d130">Document 130</ref>.</note> that North Korean
							activities will include a campaign of military harassment in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> area, continued attempts to infiltrate
							guerrilla teams, and the dispatch of terrorist and sabotage missions.
								<pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0430"/>The raid on the Blue House
							represents the most dramatic and flagrant manifestation of the campaign
							begun in late 1966 to disrupt political order in South Korea, to tie
							down large ROK forces, and to encourage insurgency in the South. North
							Korean handling of the Pueblo crisis reflects an intention to heighten
							tensions and exploit US preoccupations with Vietnam. Kim Il-Song's
							recent speeches indicate he is still determined to maintain a bellicose
							posture.</p>
                        <p>2. These developments have hardened Seoul's attitude and increased the
							likelihood of a major <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reaction to
							North Korean harassments. The North Koreans probably believe that the US
							will impose restraints on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and
							will be reluctant to escalate its own responses in Korea. The North
							Koreans now probably see great and continuing opportunities to
							exacerbate relations between Seoul and Washington.</p>
                        <p>3. We continue to believe that Pyongyang realizes that an intensification
							of incidents and attacks could escalate to the point of open warfare. We
							still estimate, however, that North Korea does not plan to invade South
							Korea and will not deliberately provoke hostilities on a scale which
							would amount to a resumption of the war.</p>
                        <p>4. Nevertheless, the general situation in Korea is more dangerous than it
							was last fall, since the possibilities of miscalculation are greater.
							The North Korean attitude is more openly truculent than at any time
							since 1953. The raid against the Presidential residence indicates that
							the North Koreans are willing to run high risks; they must have been
							aware that assassination of President Pak would have provoked a major
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliation. They may be
							counting heavily on US preoccupation with Vietnam, and on the deterrent
							value of their own mutual defense treaties with China and the Soviet
							Union.</p>
                        <p>5. We believe that North Korea is pursuing an independent policy.
							Pyongyang probably does not consult with Moscow and Peking on the
							tactical development of its policy against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the US. North Korea's relations with China are
							cool, and thus Peking's influence is quite limited. In any event, we
							believe Peking does not want to be involved in a new Korean War at this
							juncture. As for the USSR, recent events have probably forced it to pay
							somewhat more attention to developments in Korea. We believe that the
							USSR does not want a major war in the area. In the event of a crisis in
							Korea, the Soviets would probably be reluctant to apply immediate
							pressures on Pyongyang, lest they jeopardize the position they have
							built up there. And in any case their influence would not necessarily be
							decisive. However, we believe that if major hostilities seemed imminent
							the USSR would try to exert some restraint over North Korea.</p>
                        <p>6. Additional evidence since our last estimate suggests that North Korea
							will continue its efforts to establish guerrilla bases in the South. <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0431"/>But we believe that their
							prospects for success in this endeavor remain poor.</p>
                        <p>7. We now believe that the North Korean Navy has at least four “W”-class
							submarines, at least seven “KOMAR”-class guided missile boats and
							associated Styx missiles, and two “Shershen”-class fast patrol boats.
							Eighteen surface-to-air missile (<gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss>-2)
							sites, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
								declassified</hi>] have been identified. Otherwise, the general
							level of equipment and strength of the North Korean forces is as

							with the continuing dangers of the Korean situation. With the

							psychological consequences. Furthermore, any likely settlement formula
							at Panmunjom would probably be resented by the sensitive <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. We therefore believe that we should
							push ahead with the implementation of the Vance Recommendations,
							improving our own posture in respect to Korea and endeavoring to build
							upon the degree of trust and confidence re-established by his Mission.

							British and will endeavor to expand our bilateral approaches to other

							Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>1. For second week in a row, Prime Minister deliberately raised subject
							of additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops for Vietnam.
							(See memo of conversation dated Feb 29, 1968.)<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">Memorandum of conversation not found, but the
								conversation is summarized in telegram 4572 from Seoul, February 29.
								(National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–3 VIET S)</note>
							This time he began by asking whether U.S. would increase number of
							troops being sent to Vietnam. Ambassador said he believed we would be at
							level of about 525,000 men in very near future. Prime Minister said he
							thought that was good, but didn't <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0435"/>U.S. need more Korean troops. Ambassador replied that
							we do and that, as he had indicated a week ago, he intended to approach
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> on this subject again soon.
							Had Prime Minister's thoughts on this developed since our last mention
							of it, Ambassador asked.</p>
                        <p>2. The Prime Minister then outlined an elaborate scenario, indicating
							that he had been thinking about this subject since our last meeting,
							which involved the following: he said that he had excellent information
							to effect that within next year or so, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> of Japan would request U.S. to
							return Okinawa to Japan. This would give <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> a political advantage he would need to stay in
							power and to permit U.S./Japan Defense Treaty to remain in effect after
							1970. Meanwhile in Vietnam the war would be continuing, and he agreed
							with the Ambassador that this was a crucial year in Vietnam and there
							would be a continuing need for more troops to exert maximum pressure on
							the enemy.</p>
                        <p>3. After stressing that he was giving only his own ideas and had
							consulted no one, the PriMin said that an American victory in Vietnam is
							a victory for Korea, and an American defeat in Vietnam a defeat for the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Under certain circumstances,
							PriMin believed, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might be persuaded
							to send an additional two divisions and perhaps more. However, this
							could only be managed through a meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and President Park, perhaps in
							Hawaii. At that meeting (or perhaps beforehand) PriMin thought U.S.
							should state its willingness to:</p>
                        <p>(A) Provide necessary financial assistance to permit <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to place its three ready reserve
							divisions, which are now fully equipped, on active duty.</p>
                        <p>(B) U.S. should then bring the seven <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							rear area security reserve divisions up to the equipment levels of
							regular ready reserve divisions. This could be done at an equipment cost
							of about nine million dollars for each division.</p>
                        <p>(C) U.S., with reversion of Okinawa in mind, should construct a large air
							base on Cheju-do for use by such sophisticated aircraft as the F–4. </p>
                        <p>4. If this could be done, PriMin continued, President Park would probably
							be willing to send two regular divisions to Vietnam, perhaps replacing
							these regular active duty divisions in Korea with the three activated
							ready reserve divisions. In addition, by following through on previous
							proposal to employ five thousand civilian reservists in logistical jobs
							in Vietnam to enable the dispatch of previously discussed light <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division, it would then be possible to
							increase number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops for
							Vietnam by two divisions and the two-regiment light division. This would
							make a total of five <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions in
							Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: PriMin carefully characterized
							foregoing as entirely his own idea, which he has discussed with no one.
							It seems clear, however, that from refinements contained in this
							presentation, and <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0436"/>from scope of
							his proposal, that he has been thinking about this subject since our
							last meeting, and that he has quite probably discussed it with others,
							possibly including the President. I responded to all this by saying that
							we would think about this and would discuss subject with him again in
							near future.</p>
                        <p>6. I would appreciate your thoughts and suggestions for use in follow-up
							I should make on this subject. Also, questions which you would wish to
							have clarified in connection with it.</p>
                        <p>7. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> has seen

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CICI1">Chong Il-kwon</persName> has suggested to
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> the possibility
							that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> might be persuaded to
							send to Viet-Nam two combat divisions in addition to the light division
							which President Pak has already agreed, in principle, to deploy. The
							Prime Minister's proposal is set forth in detail in Seoul's 4784, a copy
							of which is attached. Although <persName>Chong</persName> stated that
							this proposal is entirely his own idea, it is possible that he has
							discussed it with President Pak and other <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> officials.</p>
                        <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0437"/>
                        <p>2. The pros and cons of this proposal are discussed below. Because a
							decision on this subject will have an impact upon our budget and upon
							equipment modernization for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and US
							forces, I do not believe any decision can be made regarding it until
							equipment availabilities are sorted out and decisions made regarding US
							reserve call up and possible additional deployments to Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>3. The Prime Minister has proposed that the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> deploy to Viet-Nam two regular <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army divisions, one light division (two regiments), and
							5,000 civilian reservists (the latter to free 5,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> logistic troops in Viet-Nam for combat
							duty). The result would be a total <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							force in Viet-Nam of about 97,000 men, including five <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army combat divisions, and 17 divisions
							in Korea. In conjunction with these deployments, according to Chong, the
							US Government, in addition to equipping, supporting, and paying the
							overseas allowances of deployed forces, would be expected to:</p>
                        <p>a. Finance the mobilization to active duty in Korea of the three Ready
							Reserve divisions (estimated cost $23 million);</p>
                        <p>b. Provide equipment to bring the seven <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> rear area security reserve divisions up to the level of
							regular Ready Reserve divisions (estimated cost $63 million);</p>
                        <p>c. Construct a large air base on Cheju Island (as a possible eventual
							replacement for Okinawa when that island reverts to Japanese
							control).</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US negotiations for the deployment
							of the light division and 5,000 civilians have already virtually been
							completed, with the exception of the issue of pay scales for the
							civilians. Equipment which could be used for this light division (or for
							US or <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces) is available in
							Okinawa. However, the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has not yet
							sought National Assembly approval of this deployment.</p>
                        <p>5. Deployment of two additional divisions would also require approval by
							the Assembly and its approval is by no means to be taken for
							granted.</p>
                        <p>6. In conjunction with the despatch of the light division, we have agreed
							to provide to the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>: two destroyers,
							12 helicopters, one battalion of 8-inch howitzers, operating and
							maintenance costs of 8 additional battalions constituting a
							counter-infiltration strike force, a $32 million counter-infiltration
							program, and financial support for the light division and 5,000
							civilians. Delivery on these commitments is proceeding on schedule.
							Total one-time cost of this package is estimated at $54.7 million, with
							an annual recurring cost of $77 million.</p>
                        <p>7. Implementation of the Prime Minister's proposal would have the
							following advantages:</p>
                        <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0438"/>
                        <p>a. It would provide two additional combat divisions for Viet-Nam over and
							above the light division the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have
							already agreed to supply;</p>
                        <p>b. It would be a strong demonstration to the North Koreans that their
							efforts to deter the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> from further
							participation in Viet-Nam had not only failed but had resulted in
							increased <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> participation;</p>
                        <p>c. It would strengthen the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
							forces in Korea. 8. Possible disadvantages include the following:</p>
                        <p>a. Availability of major items of equipment, such as the M–16 rifle and
							helicopters, is so limited that a choice would have to be made between
							arming US reserves activated, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
							troops, or the two <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions;</p>
                        <p>b. It would require major augmentation of US logistical personnel in
							Viet-Nam (roughly one American for every three Koreans);</p>
                        <p>c. The style of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> operations in
							Viet-Nam is such (i.e., virtually to take over the government of the
							areas in which they operate) that doubling the size of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces might have a significant adverse
							effect on Vietnamese attitudes;</p>
                        <p>d. Such a large increase in the level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in Viet-Nam (from 49,000 to about 97,000) would
							greatly strengthen the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s demand
							and expectation for active participation in strategic planning regarding
							the Viet-Nam conflict, in planning for peace negotiations and in the
							negotiations themselves. In this regard, we should bear in mind that the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s even now take a hard line in
							expecting a military victory in Viet-Nam and they would not double their
							forces unless they were determined to pursue this outcome. Thus
								US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations might be
							complicated and frictions might result which could have an inhibiting
							effect on <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> participation in
							post-Viet-Nam activities elsewhere in the area.</p>
                        <p>e. Cost—$141 million one-time cost (without including any estimate of the
							cost of building an airbase on Cheju-do) and a recurring cost of $387
							million. (Both figures include the cost of the light division and 5,000
							civilians.) 9. We have had preliminary discussions of the Prime
							Minister's proposal with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>. Our tentative conclusion is that,
							unless the equipment shortage is so acute that the equipment now in
							Okinawa and presently earmarked for the light division will have to be
							limited to US or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> use, Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> should be instructed
							to seek the early deployment of the light division and 5,000 civilians,
							without prejudice to the proposal to deploy two additional divisions.
							Decision regarding the latter will, we assume, have to await decisions
							regarding further US deployment.</p>
                        <p>10. This course of action, involving two Assembly approvals, might make
							the second approval of the two additional divisions more difficult if
							this proposal should turn out to be desirable and feasible. However, the
							light division could be deployed soon while the two divisions proposal
							is highly tentative and at best will take weeks to negotiate and months
							to implement. We conclude that it is the wise <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0439"/>course to proceed with what has already
							been agreed and not entangle it with this more complicated new
								proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">Paragraphs 1–10 were repeated

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We believe Dept has correctly identified main advantages and
							disadvantages of PriMin's proposal for major augmentation of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops in Vietnam. We could elaborate
							further on these in terms effect of proposal on NKorea's aggressive
							plans and possible miscalculations, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Vietnamese relations, command and control in both Vietnam
							and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> expectations with respect to conduct and settlement of
							Vietnam conflict, but Dept doubtless aware all these permutations.</p>
                        <p>2. Our own reaction to PriMin's proposal is that he has been trying to
							pass us a message. As we interpret it, he is saying that circumstances
							in both Vietnam and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> have been
							drastically altered by Tet offensive and <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>/Blue House raid, including their aftermath, and question of
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces for Vietnam now
							has to be viewed from <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0440"/>entirely
							new perspective: that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s want us to
							make all-out military effort to settle Vietnam conflict once and for
							all, and would be willing under certain conditions to participate in
							such major effort. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s are
							genuinely concerned. They are worried that <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and NVN may force compromise solution in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if war carries on until U.S. elections.
							This would then, they feel, encourage Asian Communists to try
							concentrate next on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe he is also telling us that because of new circumstances
							previous understanding on despatch of light division alone would be
							regarded as piecemeal effort by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							public, and Assembly and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would
							have difficulty in supporting it now. He is hinting that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> public accepts everything we have
							promised and implemented since Blue House raid/Pueblo incident,
							including light division quid pro quo items, as response to new
							situation here and that quid pro quo offered in exchange for light
							division would no longer be sufficient to justify political risks of
							proposing this relatively minor increase in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> contribution. He is pointedly stressing that what is
							needed to obtain further <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							participation in Vietnam is very dramatic program—call for a larger
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troop contribution matched by a
							larger U.S. aid program—which will clearly strengthen, as opposed to
							maintain, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength in
							country.</p>
                        <p>4. Extent to which <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s proposal
							has Park's backing is difficult to assess with certainty. If Park has
							been exposed to this plan, we doubt that it has been in more than
							general way. We feel that at this juncture proposal should be considered
							as being essentially <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s without
							Park's approval. Proposal, if implemented, has serious budgetary
							implications for <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>—a factor which
							would be of lesser concern to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
							but would give Park pause because of potential impact on economic
							development programs. We suspect origins of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s proposal are to be found in his recent activities
							in Defense and mobilization planning. In this connection <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> is aware <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces are working on concept of 30-division
							force by early 1970's which involves converting rear area security
							divisions to ready reserve divisions, and problem is how to get
							equipment for these additional ready reserve divisions. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> may feel that in light recent
							press stories on need for additional forces in Vietnam, we are preparing
							put pressure on <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> for more than
							light division and if <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s take
							initiative with generous offer, U.S. would respond in same generous
							vein.</p>
                        <p>5. Park's current attitude on light division despatch and related timing
							consideration is not clear. National Assembly action is major
							consideration. Under present planning, Assembly will meet in mid-April
							for one month, reconvene early July for one month, and then convene in
							early September for year-end session. Reverberations of Blue House
								raid/<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>/Vance mission are still strong
							enough to make <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>Park hesitate
							about going to April session for troop despatch authorization unless he
							can put it forward in rather elaborate context of additional American
							troop contribution, clear indication that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces will be built up at home and as result of
							agreement at highest U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> levels. If
							none of these factors present, believe Park would wait until July to
							seek authority for light division only. Nature and intensity of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> infiltration by July, and ability of
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s to contain it, would also have
							important bearing on this.</p>
                        <p>6. For more precise estimate I would have to probe much further than I
							have been able to so far to get clear picture of what lies behind <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s proposal and extent to which it
							is supported by President Park, and to learn Park's current attitude
							toward despatch of light division only. I feel we may have to open up a
							line of discussion fairly soon if we are to get ROK troops of any size
							before end of summer. As indicated in previous para much depends on what
							U.S. is going to do.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> planned to
							travel to Honolulu on April 4, 1968, for consultations with various
							officials on the situation in Vietnam following the Tet Offensive and
							the President's initiatives outlined in his Address to the Nation on
							March 31. (For text, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the
								Presidents of the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1968–69</hi>,
							Book I, pages 469–476.) President Pak had accepted an invitation to meet
							with President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in
							Honolulu on April 7. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King,
							Jr., on April 4 and the subsequent civil disorders that erupted in
							Washington and other major urban centers, President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> postponed his trip and
							scheduled meeting with President Pak.</p>
                        <p>Rescheduling the Presidential meeting was complicated by circumstances in
							Korea. President Pak was reluctant to agree to meet with President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> after learning he
							would first meet with President Thieu of South Vietnam. President Pak
							believed that to meet under those circumstances would cause him to lose
							face and would create the impression that he was merely a follower,
							rather than a leader of high stature. Korean officials also worried that
							the presence of both <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0442"/>Presidents
							Pak and Thieu “would make it look to world that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> had brought to Honolulu two
							leading objectors to bombing pause policy in order to force them into
							line and accept bombing pause publicly announced by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> on March 31.” (Telegram 5637
							from Seoul, April 11; National Archives and Records Administration, RG
							59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 US)
							President Pak strongly opposed President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s decision to halt the bombing in Vietnam and
							seek a negotiated settlement with North Vietnam. (Intelligence
							Information Cable, TDCS 314/06457–68, April 17, and Intelligence
							Information Cable, TDCS 314/06455–68, April 17; Johnson Library,
							National Security File, Country File, Korea, Cables, Vol. VI)</p>
                        <p>President Pak was also affected by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s announced withdrawal from the upcoming U.S.
							Presidential election. The Embassy learned that President Pak, who
							valued his close, personal relationship with <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>, was upset that he received no advance
							information about the President's announcement. Intelligence reports
							characterized President Pak as “depressed deeply over President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>'s decision not to
							seek re-election and the possible ramifications on future U.S. security
							policies toward Korea and Asia.” President Pak reportedly repeated
							frequently that with President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in office “for the first time in Korean
							diplomatic history, a major world power had treated Korea on an equal
							country-to-country basis.” (Intelligence Information Cable, TDCS
							314/06457–68, April 17; ibid.) Facing the loss of a strong supporter of
							Korea in the White House, President Pak and other Korean leaders were
							uneasy about the upcoming change in U.S. leadership. (Telegrams from
							Seoul and memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>

                        <p>CAP 80808. Following are summary briefing notes for Honolulu meeting with
							President Park. We shall have a big black book with us on Monday.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Major Topics</p>
                        <p>Park has three things on his mind:</p>
                        <p>A. Your personal decision<note n="2" xml:id="d190fn2">Reference is to the
								President's decision not to seek reelection.</note> and its effect
							on US policy in Asia.</p>
                        <p>B. Korean defense and other problems.</p>
                        <p>C. The Viet-Nam situation and negotiations.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. US Policy in Asia</p>
                        <p>Park has shown great unhappiness over your personal decision and has even
							expressed the feeling that he should have been consulted, as an old and
							true friend. Above all, he fears that without your leadership the US may
							abandon the Asian policies it has been following.</p>
                        <p>Thus, he would deeply appreciate your full comment on the political
							situation at home and what it means for our policy in Asia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Korean Problems</p>
                        <p>1. Retaliation for further North Korean incidents. Although the North
							Koreans have not engaged in significant incidents since mid-February
							(when an upsurge did occur last year), Park and all the Koreans remain
							anxious. You will recall that Park pressed Vance very hard indeed for a
							general undertaking that we would join him in immediate retaliation in
							kind. He strongly implied the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would
							go it alone if we did not join.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you stick to Vance's position—that we are prepared for joint
							discussion in the light of the facts of each case. However, we cannot
							get away from the fact that any reprisals could build up rapidly and
							even threaten major hostilities. You understand how the Koreans feel,
							but they must reckon that any major hostilities are not in their
							interest any more than ours, and that, in view of our major
							responsibility to help in their defense, we must be fully consulted.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0444"/>
                        <p>2. Building Up <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Defenses. Park will
							probably describe significant and recognized defects in the equipment of
							his armed forces and counter-infiltration agencies. We are in fact
							proceeding rapidly under the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							program, and have worked out agreement on the uses for the $100 million
							pending supplemental appropriation. These take into account his
							expressed desires.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">The $100 million
								supplemental-aid package approved by the Embassy, the Korean Task
								Force, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense
								consisted of an F–4D squadron, small arms for the homeland reserve
								force, support for the Korean National Police, and M–16 rifles for
								designated counterinfiltration units. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>, March 11; Washington

								73 A 1250, Korea 091.3 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>)

                        <p>Suggest you be prepared to go over these actions, on which we will have
							details.</p>
                        <p>3. Maintenance of US forces in Korea. Park may request assurance that US
							forces, including the additional aircraft, will not be withdrawn from
							Korea without his consent. We have told them many times that we have no
							plan to reduce the general level of our ground forces—by implication as
							long as they have forces in Viet-Nam. We have given no assurance on the
							additional aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you repeat that we have no plan to reduce our ground forces under
							present circumstances, but avoid going further than promising full
							consultation both on the aircraft and on any later plan concerning
							ground forces.</p>
                        <p>4. Amendment of Defense Treaty. Park and other Koreans have pressed us
							for an amendment of the treaty to make it automatic in the event of
							aggression. They have drawn a parallel with declarations we have made in
							the Philippines—that an attack there would necessarily involve our
							forces at the outset.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you point out flatly that any amendment of the treaty is out of
							the question, and that any declaration would have the same Senate
							problems. At the same time, you can tell them flatly that they can count
							on us if aggression actually takes place.</p>
                        <p>5. 16-Nation Declaration. Park and other Koreans have pressed us to join
							them in getting a reaffirmation of the declaration made in 1953 by 16
							nations—that they would act in the event of aggression and that
							hostilities would not necessarily be confined to Korean territory. We
							have told them that we ourselves fully support that declaration, <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0445"/>but that others—such as the
							French and even the British—would not go along with reaffirming it
							today. We have pointed out that, in the absence of unanimity or very
							close to it, a strong effort to get reaffirmation would be a net
							minus.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you stick to this position. (Our soundings, even with such as the
							Thai, confirm our fears that we don't have the votes.)</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Case. As you know, Park is worried that
							our private meetings could imply recognition of the North Korean regime.
							He is worried that we may go too far in the direction of apology. And he
							regrets that we did not take tougher action after the seizure.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you calm his fears about recognition—tell him that we will
							continue to keep him fully informed—and be prepared to review with him
							our proposed conditional apology, to which he has not objected. Repeat
							at the same time that we are not going to apologize for any alleged
							actions which we cannot independently confirm.</p>
                        <p>As to more forceful action, suggest that you note that we have examined
							many actions, but have concluded that little ones would be mere
							pinpricks, and that any major action (for example, against the North
							Korean Air Force) would almost certainly mean major hostilities. He
							understands this bind, even though he does not like it.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. Viet-Nam Issues</p>
                        <p>1. Additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Forces. Thieu has now
							formally asked the Koreans for more forces. We have been discussing a
							light division with them since last fall, and also 5,000 additional
							civilians.</p>
                        <p>Park is prepared to discuss these matters, but does not want them in the
							communique—and we have agreed.</p>
                        <p>We are uncertain at this point what position to recommend. Both the 5,000
							civilians and the light division make sense from a military standpoint,
							and would have major political advantages for us. However, the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> tentatively thinks that providing for
							equipment for these forces may cut across our top priority for <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, at least this summer. We need to
							hammer this out before you leave.</p>
                        <p>2. General Situation. Park has just had an optimistic report on the
							military situation from his own General Chae. He will want to compare
							notes across the board.</p>
                        <p>3. Negotiations and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Participation. We
							have assured the Koreans that they will be fully consulted both in
							contacts and talks. They have no plan to be at the site of contacts, but
							will certainly send a representative to the site of the talks and will
							be looking for some form of participation at that stage. We have not yet
							discussed with them our position during the contacts, nor have we gone
							into any detail on our substantive position in the talks.</p>

                        <p>A. You be prepared to go over the instructions to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> fully, but without showing him
							the actual document (which does not refer to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> participation being nailed down in the contacts).</p>
                        <p>B. You assure him categorically that our position in the talks will be
							based on the Manila communique and the 14 points. We stand on the Geneva
							Accords for both Viet-Nam and Laos, and on conditions for free choice in
							the South.</p>

                        <p>5706. 1. I am sure you have in mind fact that Park reacts sensitively to

                        </list>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>Following your December 21 luncheon meeting with Park in Canberra,
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> worked out
							agreement that the Koreans would deploy an additional brigade
							(approximately 6,000 troops) and 5,000 civilians to Vietnam. The
							civilians would free 5,000 logistic troops now in Vietnam for combat
							duty, and the result would be an additional light division.</p>
                        <p>With the January raid and resulting tension, Park shelved this, with our
							tacit consent, and has never sought National Assembly approval.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, we have gone ahead with a substantial part of the
							commitments we offered in the negotiations. All told, we had offered
							direct support and equipment costs for the light division totaling
							approximately $88 million, plus additional military assistance totaling
							about $45 million. Of the latter, we have already gone ahead with
							virtually the whole, including the $32 million counterinsurgency package
							described to you at this morning's briefing. As a matter of practical
							fact, all these items made sense, and we would have found them
							reasonable in any case. However, you should note that the $32 million
							has been funded from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> funds under an
							authority that exists only where there is a relationship to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Thus, there is basic truth in what General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> says—that we have performed a lot already, while
							they have not moved on their side.</p>
                        <p>Park's problem is quite simply that he is not at all sure of getting
							Assembly approval, in the face of a general feeling that Korea needs its
							forces at home. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> has
							reported since that they might now ask for additional commitments.
							Moreover, as General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
							pointed out this morning, the $12 million worth of equipment now set
							aside in Okinawa for the Korean light division contains many items of
							highest priority for South Vietnamese armed forces.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Suggested Talking Points</p>
                        <p>1. Suggest you start by feeling Park out on his Assembly problem, while
							making it absolutely clear to him that the additional forces would be
							most useful.</p>
                        <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>2. If he asks for additional commitments from us, you might point
							forcefully to the very large totals we are now providing under <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and service funds this year, shown in
							Tab A attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2">Attached but not printed.
								The breakdown of support consisted of $160 million, including around
								$12 million for the light division, in 1968 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds; $100 million in supplemental <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> funds; and $31.2 million for the
								counterinsurgency package.</note> The total is about $292 million.
							You could, of course, say that you would study additional requests
							within reason.</p>
                        <p>3. If he takes the opposite tack—saying that he simply cannot get
							Assembly approval unless things really cool down in Korea this
							summer—suggest you at least point out clearly how much we have already
							done under our commitments, and note that this presents us with
							something of a Congressional problem—particularly for the $32 million.
							You might go on to explore the possibility suggested by Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>—that they increase their
							forces in Vietnam simply by delaying rotation or by “rounding out”.
							While Park has a commitment to his Assembly to get specific authority
							for additional major units, he once before evaded this by a “rounding
							out” that amounted to about 2500 men. If he could use the same
							technique—up to perhaps 5000 men—it would be most useful.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">General</p>
                        <p>Suggest strongly that you take up this topic privately with him. If he
							has his Ministers in the room, the price would go up, and he paint
							himself into a bad corner.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we have already agreed—at his request—that the subject will not
							be mentioned in the communique or in any press backgrounder. We stuck to
							this agreement this morning and told the press that so far as we knew,
							the topic would not come up. Obviously, he would be highly sensitive to
							any implication that he agreed to an increase at this meeting. However,
							he is also well aware of the need—and he now has a general request for
							more forces direct from Thieu.</p>

                        <p>2. “22 [21]. The April 5 <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> plan would
							provide a force structure and equipment capability vis-e-vis North
							Korean which would:</p>
                        <p>A. Give the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ground forces an
							advantage in quantitative combat power, an advantage considered to be
							beyond the needs of a purely defensive mission, assuming adequate US
							augmentations.</p>
                        <p>B. Enable the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force to match more
							nearly the combat strength supported by a hardened base structure as
							possessed by North Korea, and give ROKAF a higher capability for
							surprise quick strike action.</p>
                        <p>C. Greatly increase the Navy/Marine offensive capability by establishing
							about a division size amphibious force with a commensurate increase in
							shore bombardment means, as well as a significant surface striking
							force.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0450"/>
                        <p>23 [22]. The implementation of the April 5 <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> plan would provide the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with an increased military capability which could,
							without US support or sanction, engage in retaliatory actions of greater
							scope and magnitude against the North.</p>
                        <p>24 [23]. If logistic needs were accumulated in advance or logistic
							support from some source assured, the force structure contemplated in
							the April 5 <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> plan could tempt the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to undertake a preemptive
							attack against the North in the belief that it could win a relatively
							short war.</p>
                        <p>25 [24]. There are therefore grounds for serious concern that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> national leadership may be
							contemplating military moves which may range from substantially larger
							retaliatory actions to a preemptive strike against the North to effect
							reunification. A move of the latter type would be initiated at an
							appropriate time but prior to the anticipated overt military action by
							the North. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s may in fact be
							counting on another dramatic raid by the North Koreans to provide the
							provocation for a justifiable retaliatory move which the proposed force
							structure would permit developing into a full-scale assault on the
							North.</p>
                        <p>26 [25]. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> national leadership believes
							that if reunification can be effected rapidly by military means, the
							great powers will not intervene and will accept the fait accompli.</p>
                        <p>27 [26]. Full US support of the April 5 <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> plan, as we interpret it, is not justified in terms of
							present US objectives in Korea because it could lead to a military force
							capable of independently taking courses of action inimical to the US
							national interest.</p>
                        <p>28 [27]. Since there are adequate indicators that the North Korean
							military capability has, in the relatively recent past, been
							significantly improved and its total defense posture enhanced, and if,
							as the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s expect, the North will
							attempt to unify Korea by overt military means in 1970 or possibly
							sooner, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/US defense posture
							requires improvement. To effect a defense posture capable of holding
							north of Seoul, in addition to the availability and timely arrival of
							envisaged US augmentation forces, certain elements of the plan would, if
							implemented, contribute to this objective. Extensive hardening of
							forward positions is necessary: improvements in infrastructure for army,
							navy and air force needs should be undertaken, particularly construction
							for airfield dispersal and hardening and to support an air <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>; facilities to permit rapid receipt and
							forward movement of external combat and logistic support should be
							provided; selected improvements in mobility and communications for the
							existing force structure are required; and, though not mentioned in the
							April 5 plan, the availability in the area and largely under US control,
							of ammunition war reserves for all services should be assured.”</p>

                        <p>(a) <hi rend="italic"> US View</hi>—At Canberra on December 21, 1967,

							On the basis of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> commitment in
							Canberra, US assistance in equipment amounting to $88 million and
							additional military assistance of $45 million was earmarked from defense
							appropriations for the use of the additional ROK troops to be sent to

							would be “impossible” for him to send more active soldiers to South
							Vietnam at present because of the situation in South Korea. He said,
							however, that it would be possible for the Republic of Korea to send one
							combat group (regimental combat team) numbering 5,000–6,000 men from
							rear areas in South Vietnam and to have them replaced by civilians. Park
							said about 1500 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> soldiers are rotated
							every month and it would be possible in about three months to send 5,000
							civilians to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. He agreed to set July

                        <p>There is a possibility that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might

							strengthened, however, it would be possible to send one or two
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions to <gloss target="#t_SVN1">SVN</gloss>. At a later point President Park said
							he would like to send 6,000 additional troops but he had just barely
							organized the local reserve corps in South Korea whose members must
							undergo training so he must wait until summer to see how the situation
							develops. The National Assembly will not (now) approve the troop

							during a private discussion with Chief Presidential Secretary Yi Hu-rak
							and Defense Minister <persName corresp="#p_CYCY1">Ch'oe

							issues of military assistance to Korea and a formal revision of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty.
							President Pak said he sensed President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> has lost considerable political power and

                        <p>6043. For <persName>Bundy</persName> from Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>1. Two weeks after the Honolulu meeting of the two Presidents, it is
							possible to assess its effect in Korea. If there is no pronounced, or
							even noticeable change in Korean thinking as a result of the meeting, it
							can be said that the top echelon, especially President Park, derived a
							considerable sense of achievement from it. Drawing their inspiration
							from the top levels here as usual, press and public alike seem to feel
							considerably reassured in the ever-vital matters of American support <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0455"/>for this country, and the
							sensitivity of the American President to their problems. As this is the
							effect we were striving to achieve, success of the meeting seems
							clear.</p>
                        <p>2. This is not to say that such successes have any permanent character.
							It is in the nature of this people and their leaders to require
							assurances and gestures periodically, and this will be especially true
							while North Korean pressure is maintained, and while candidates for U.S.
							Presidency discuss solutions for Viet-Nam problem in terms which cause
							uneasiness here and in other parts of free Asia.</p>
                        <p>3. The fact of a day-long meeting of American and Korean Presidents would
							have its own considerable impact here, but this was supplemented by a
							communique at Honolulu which provided considerable support for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government in matters of internal
							security and investment—certainly the areas of greatest concern to the
							Korean President. Park is said to be in something of a glow about this,
							and if that is true it is understandable because no one accuses him of
							giving anything in return. Even the opposition, not noted for its
							perception or objectivity, feels required to stand publicly on the
							position that the communique contained nothing new, or was more or less
							the same as previous pronouncements. This is hardly political fare to
							arouse the interest, or the fears, of the Korean public.</p>
                        <p>4. In <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> eyes, the contribution of the
							country, i.e. fifty thousand troops to the Vietnam problem, has found
							clear expression of American appreciation in this bilateral meeting,
							placing American/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations on the
							special plane the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s think they merit.
							What the other allies think of this is of little concern to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s as long as proper inference is drawn
							here—and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has seen to that. The
							Vietnamese, Thais and Australians may now proceed singly or collectively
							to Washington, but the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have had
							their day with our President and they appreciate it.</p>

                        <p>The Korean National Assembly addressed the issue of the Homeland Reserve
							Force in early May 1968. The opposition New Democratic Party had already
							publicly recorded its opposition, expressing fears that the force could
							be used for political purposes and stating that existing military and
							police units were sufficient to meet threats from the North. (Airgram
							A–480 from Seoul, March 28; National Archives and Records
							Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 12 <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0456"/>KOR S; and
							telegram 6054 from Seoul, May 2; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–3 KOR S) After attempts to reach a compromise on the
							issue failed, the New Democratic Party boycotted the National Assembly,
							leaving the matter to the Democratic Republican Party to debate and
							pass. The Assembly passed modified legislation creating the Homeland
							Reserve Force on May 10. (Telegrams 7031, May 6, and 7144, May 10, from
							Seoul; both ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–3 KOR S) The
							legislation incorporated several provisions proffered by the opposition
							party, such as giving the police rather than the military authority over
							the unit and preventing the unit from participating in political
							activities. (Telegram 7144 from Seoul, May 10; ibid.) The Embassy
							prepared a detailed summary of the legislation that outlined and
							analyzed its provisions. (Airgram A–604 from Seoul, May 23; ibid.)</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. It is not very difficult to specify evidence to support existence of
							Korean ardor for reunification (Ref A). Problems in this connection
							arose as far back as 1953 with Syngman Rhee and resurfaced again
							recently as result of Blue House raids and other current forms of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> pressure. The Vance mission
							correspondence sheds considerable specific light on the subject, as well
							as on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> view of the improbability of
							great power non-intervention. To this we add our assessment of current
							atmosphere based on our knowledge of personalities at the
							decision-making level.</p>
                        <p>2. The desire to reunify this country runs very deep. It is the natural
							impulse of a homogeneous people living in one half of a divided nation,
							and this impulse is only strengthened by fact that many <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> leaders are Northerners. If our
							telegrams of late have contained reminders <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0458"/>of this sentiment, it is because we are currently
							injecting more military hardware into the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces, and I want to be sure that all concerned
							have in mind the various [garble] and implications of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> preparedness.</p>
                        <p>3. My emphasis has not been on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ardor
							or anger at <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> provocations. They are but
							parts of the education. Whether ardor, anger or frustration can trigger
							action we wish to prevent depends largely on capability, and therefore
							whether the problem of unification becomes more or less acute in months
							or years ahead would seem to depend in large part on the type of
							equipment we furnish. It is timely to examine this subject because
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s will probably table a
							substantial additional military aid program request at meeting of
							Defense Ministers later this month.<note n="4" xml:id="d199fn4">Fulfilling one of the provisions of the joint communique issued at

							has instructed <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> embassies to assure
							all that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> has no thought of
							anything other than peaceful reunification of the country (Ref B).<note n="5" xml:id="d199fn5">On July 4 the Prime Minister told <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> of the establishment of a

                        <p>A. We believe that, under present circumstances, Pyongyang does not
							intend to invade South Korea. Nor do we believe that, at least for the
							next year or so, Pyongyang will take actions that it considers involve
							high risk of provoking a new Korean War.<note n="2" xml:id="d200fn2">The

                        </p>
                        <p>B. We do believe, however, that Pyongyang is engaged in a determined
							effort to apply its own version of the doctrine of “peoples' war”: to
							provoke incidents along the Demilitarized Zone (<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>) and to carry out terrorist attacks throughout the
							South in hopes of creating a situation which would, in time, shake the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government's control of the
							nation.</p>
                        <p>C. Pyongyang might be tempted to go well beyond incidents along the
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>; e.g., it might attempt to seize
							and hold a piece of territory south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or stage a raid into South Korea with fairly large
							forces. In general, however, we believe that Pyongyang would consider
							such moves too risky, especially any attempt to hold South Korean
							territory.</p>
                        <p>D. Hence, in the short term, the principal danger is that of
							miscalculation; i.e., that the North Koreans will press so hard that
							Seoul will order large-scale retaliation. In this case, Pyongyang would
							be likely to respond with commensurate force, and there would be an
							increasing chance of escalation into major hostilities.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. The seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the attack on the
							presidential mansion in Seoul, both in late January 1968, were followed
							by a period <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428" facs="0460"/>of relative quiet.
							Since mid-April, however, North Korean harassment and infiltration in
							the area of the Demilitarized Zone (<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>)
							has intensified, and it appears that saboteurs have again been active in
							Seoul. With the advent of favorable weather, we expect guerrilla teams
							to begin moving down the coasts of South Korea in a renewed effort to
							establish bases in the mountainous hinterland.<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> continued

								S)</note> On the propaganda front, the bellicose line adopted by
							North Korean Premier Kim Il-Song at the October 1966 Korean Labor Party
							Conference has been maintained, with somewhat greater truculence since
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident. It is apparent, therefore,
							that we are entering another cycle of North Korea's campaign of violence
							and intimidation against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. We have reviewed the available evidence and concluded once again that,
							under present circumstances, Pyongyang does not intend to invade South
							Korea. Nor do we believe that, at least for the next year or so,
							Pyongyang will take actions that it considers involve high risk of
							provoking a new Korean War. This judgment rests in part on our view of
							how North Korea would assess its prospects in a new war. Despite the
							emphasis on modernizing its armed forces, on training reserves and
							increasing local militia, and on the protection of key installations
							against air attack, Pyongyang almost certainly would not expect to
							overrun South Korea or to escape serious damage in the North. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army is superior in numbers; Pyongyang
							would almost certainly consider that the presence of US forces virtually
							assured their participation and their reinforcement if necessary; and
							North Korea itself would require material support, and probably
							manpower, from China or the USSR.<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">See Annex:
								North and South Korean Forces. [Footnote in the source text.]</note>
							Thus, any plans for a deliberate attack leading to a renewal of the
							Korean War would require the assurance of support from the USSR, China,
							or both. Under present circumstances, it is extremely doubtful that
							Pyongyang would receive any assurances in advance from either Communist
							power that the support required for a large-scale conflict in South
							Korea would be available.</p>
                        <p>3. More directly, we do not see indications of preparations of the nature
							and scope we would expect to see if North Korea were planning war or
							expected it in the near future. There is, for example, no evidence—in
							this nation of chronic shortages—of unusually large imports of food or
							medicines, or other unusual international transactions. There <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0461"/>have been rumors of increased
							draft calls, mobilization of reserves, unusual troop movements and
							deployments, and the buildup of stockpiles near the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, but none of these or similar
							indicators of impending large-scale action are supported by reliable
							evidence. The “war is coming” tone of letters from North Korea to Japan
							appears to reflect official propaganda; such letters almost certainly
							suit the regime's purposes since all outgoing mail is carefully
							censored. Finally, if North Korea were planning a surprise attack, it
							would seem unwise to foment tension and keep the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the US on the alert.</p>
                        <p>4. Nor do we believe that the North Koreans are trying to provoke the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> into a resumption of major
							hostilities. Pyongyang might hope thus to activate its defense treaties
							with China and the USSR, and also to avoid condemnation by world
							opinion. But we do not believe that the North Korean leaders would
							expect either the USSR or Communist China to cooperate in a
							“counterattack” that could overrun the South.</p>
                        <p>5. We do believe, however, that Pyongyang is engaged in a determined
							effort to create the conditions for a “peoples' war” in South Korea. We
							also believe that Pyongyang currently rates the risks of this enterprise
							as not very high. The North Koreans probably view the US involvement in
							Vietnam and the resultant discord in the US as limiting the military
							capabilities and the will of the US to support any serious <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliatory ventures against the North.
							US restraint in the Pueblo affair probably strengthened this view, and
							North Korean intelligence probably has a reasonably accurate picture of
							Washington's pressures on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to
							forgo strong retaliatory measures in the Blue House and other
							affairs.</p>
                        <p>6. Thus, Pyongyang probably feels reasonably safe in creating incidents
							along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and in carrying out
							terrorist attacks throughout South Korea. These serve to give some
							credence at home to its claims of “imperialist aggression” and a
							developing resistance movement in the South. Pyongyang also intends them
							to embarrass and distract the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government and to cause a loss of confidence in its leaders which could,
							in time, loosen their control of the nation. Meanwhile, these actions
							have caused some misunderstanding and strains between the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the US.</p>
                        <p>7. Pyongyang might be tempted to go well beyond incidents along the
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. It might, for example, attempt
							to seize and hold a piece of territory south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or stage a raid into South Korea with
							fairly large forces. We do not entirely rule out such actions. They
							would depend on how Pyongyang judged the probable reactions of the US
							and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. In general, however, we believe
							that Pyongyang would consider such moves as too risky, especially any
							attempt to hold South Korean territory.</p>
                        <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>8. Kim's present course of action vis-e-vis South Korea dates from 1966,
							although some indications of long-range preparations for intensified
							action were visible earlier. After several years of economic difficulty
							at home and consistent failure to capitalize on political unrest in the
							South, the frustrated Kim attempted to inject some dynamism into his
							regime by securing tighter control over the government and driving the
							population to greater efforts in its behalf. He seems to have succeeded
							in pruning much of what he considered deadwood from the government, the
							party, the military, and the economy; a series of low-keyed purges has
							reduced his leadership group to a handful of trusted comrades; and Kim
							has demanded and is receiving personal adulation on an unprecedented
							scale.</p>
                        <p>9. Public participation in the regime's many new programs has been
							fostered (along with acceptance of hardships) by nationalistic
							exhortations to prepare for “the foremost revolutionary task”—i.e., a
							Communist takeover of the South and reunification on Pyongyang's terms.
							In Kim's doctrine, the success of the revolutionary struggle in the
							South requires parallel efforts to build up the revolutionary base in
							the North, to improve its economy so that it will impress the
							southerners, and to strengthen its defense against the day when
							reactionary forces in the South, in desperation, strike northward. It is
							apparent that to make this line credible requires, at a minimum, some
							evidence of revolutionary struggle in the South and a demonstrably
							aggressive enemy along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. War
							tensions apparently prevailing among the northerners are evidence that
							the regime has achieved some degree of success in its indoctrination
							program.</p>
                        <p>10. This does not mean that North Korea will be satisfied with the mere
							semblance of a revolution in the South. Pyongyang's violent actions in
							1967, coupled with its longstanding campaign of political subversion in
							South Korea, attest to the seriousness of its purpose. But Pyongyang
							probably has little expectation of developing a revolutionary movement
							in the South in the near term. North Korean theoreticians tend to
							emphasize the inadequate basis for revolutionary action in the South and
							the time and energy required to develop one. Thus, the leadership
							probably views its current efforts as part of a long-term campaign to
							upset the political equilibrium in the South, meanwhile strengthening in
							some measure the existing Communist clandestine apparatus there.</p>
                        <p>11. It is possible that North Korean leaders have persuaded themselves
							that political and military conditions in the US and in Korea, as well
							as in Vietnam, make this year the best time for a radical
							intensification of this revolutionary strategy. In our view, however,
							North Korea is not committed to any particular sequence of moves nor to
							any firm timetable. Pyongyang's propaganda, in contrast to the
							statements of <pb n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0463"/>captured North
							Korean infiltrators, has invariably been vague on timing; the phrase
							most frequently used is “within our generation.” The North Korean plan
							of action appears similarly flexible; <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US defense measures and other responses, and the
							demonstrated effectiveness of various types of North Korean operations
							are the prime considerations. At any rate, to serve Pyongyang's current
							strategy, the campaign of violence need only continue; there seems to be
							no requirement for escalation to the level of major hostilities.</p>
                        <p>12. In this situation, the principal danger in the short term is one of
							miscalculation—i.e., that North Korea, in the process of probing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and US resolve, will overplay its hand
							and that an increasingly exasperated President Pak will order
							large-scale retaliation. Pyong- yang's response in this situation would
							be difficult to predict with any degree of confidence. On the one hand,
							the North Koreans might feel that they had to accept the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliation because, at this juncture,
							the risk of major hostilities would seem too high. It seems more likely,
							however, that they would feel compelled to respond with commensurate
							force. Though North Korea would probably stop short of actions certain
							to provoke a full-scale war, the proximity of hostile armies would make
							the situation highly volatile and war could result.</p>
                        <p>13. In such a crisis, decisions in Pyongyang and Seoul on any further
							moves would probably be affected, and perhaps decisively, by the
							attitudes and advice of their major allies. In our view, neither the
							USSR nor Communist China would consider a war in Korea to be in its
							interest. Without flatly refusing Pyongyang all military support, they
							would probably encourage North Korea to limit hostilities.</p>
                        <p>14. <hi rend="italic">The Longer Term</hi>. In any case, a tense and
							risky situation is likely to continue in Korea well beyond the one year
							period of this estimate. Kim Il-Song is a relatively young man; he
							appears to be in firm control in the North; and his hard-line views are
							likely to hold sway there for many years. Of critical importance will be
							the ability of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> people over the
							years to stand united against Communist subversion, and the ability of
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to cope effectively with
							North Korean harassments. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> confidence
							in the face of these long-term threats will depend heavily on the US
							posture in the Far East.<note n="5" xml:id="d200fn5">This report was

                        <p>1. The North Korean Army has a strength of about 345,000. It is probably
							at full strength, with a larger proportion in combat units than
								US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces have. North Korean
							troops are disciplined, highly trained, and alert. By their standards
							they are probably combat-ready. We do not know to what extent, if any,
							their heavy ground equipment is currently being replaced or augmented by
							the Soviets. With the exception of assault rifles and some new rockets,
							Soviet-designed weapons of World War II continue to predominate. Present
							stockpiles appear sufficient to support offensive action for at least a
							month.</p>
                        <p>2. The South Korean Army has some 532,000 personnel and the marine force
							numbers about 31,500. Of the total forces, some 50,000 are in Vietnam.
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> units are limited by old
							equipment, shortages of spare parts, and very austere supply levels. The
							two US divisions in Korea are under strength and not rated as having
							attained combat-ready status.</p>
                        <p>3. On balance, we estimate that neither side has the ability to conduct a
							sustained attack (i.e., for six months) or achieve a decisive advantage
							without substantial outside logistical support.</p>
                        <p>4. The North Korean Air Force could provide a strong defense against air
							attack. It has some 450 jet fighters—380 Mig-15/17s, 7 Mig-19s, and at
							least 60 Mig-21s. Almost all of the Mig-21s have probably been delivered
							over the past two years. Over the past three years, the number of
							surface-to-air missile (SA–2) sites has increased from 2 to 20. There
							are also 80 IL–28 jet light bombers, which, with its fighters, provide
							North Korea an offensive capability unmatched by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have about 200 fighter aircraft, predominantly F–86s,
							but about 60 F–5 supersonic fighters have been introduced. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Air Force has been heavily reinforced
							since the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident by the basing of some
							150 US supersonic jet fighters in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>5. The North Korean Navy is essentially a coastal patrol and inshore
							defense force. Its main offensive strength includes at least 4 “W”-class
							submarines, at least 7 “Komar”-class guided missile boats and associated
							Styx missiles, and 3 “Shershen”-class fast patrol boats. The “Komars”
							and “Shershens” have probably been provided by the USSR over the past
							two years or so. North Korea also has 39 other motor torpedo boats, and
							there are at least 2 cruise missile coastal defense complexes. The
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Navy is also primarily a coastal
							patrol force; it has about 60 ships, including 4 destroyer types, 6 fast
							attack transports, 10 mine-sweepers, 20 patrol ships, and 20 amphibious
							ships.</p>

                        <p rend="center">U.S. POLICY TOWARD KOREA</p>
                        <p rend="center">Abstract</p>
                        <p>Despite the substantial success of US policies in Korea, the need to
							change our approach is increasingly evident. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s economic progress is no longer dependent on our
							massive economic aid, and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> political
							development is increasingly incompatible with the deep involvement we
							have had in Korean economic and, at times, political decisions. At the
							same time, the more belligerent behavior of North Korea has given us a
							new incentive to re-examine our security posture in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The US cannot simply congratulate itself on a job well done and walk
							away. A rapid disengagement—political, economic, and especially
							military—could pull the props from under much of what our blood and
							treasure have helped to build. Political and economic disarray, or
							worse, would probably be produced in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. The signal conveyed to the Communists by a brusque
							military pull-back, especially if it were coupled with a bad outcome in
							Viet-Nam, could be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>The US must long retain a real though diminishing role in support of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. It is not realistic to hope
							that the animosities which focus in Korea can soon be abated by some
							form of peaceful reunification, nor should we expect Japan to replace us
							in our Korean role. In fact, the modest <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0466"/>contribution to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							security which Japan may make is probably contingent on our continued
							lead in both political and military matters.</p>
                        <p>Our policy choices in Korea are thus really rather narrow and center
							largely on security considerations. We can: (a) continue our support for
							a gradual increase in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defensive
							capabilities or (b) seek through substantial additional resource inputs
							to give the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> rather quickly the
							capability of handling an all-out North Korean attack with only US
							logistic support.</p>
                        <p>Considerations of cost aside, the second of these strategies is clearly
							preferable. We could in this way rapidly adjust our military, as well as
							our political and economic, policies to the growing self-reliance of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. More important, this strategy
							would in a few years time all but eliminate the risk that US combat
							forces would have to be committed to help the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> repel a new North Korean attack.</p>
                        <p>Even in terms of cost, the first of the above strategies would probably
							have no advantage. At projected military assistance levels, the growth
							in ROK defensive capabilities would be very slow. The reduction in US
							force levels in Korea would have to be correspondingly gradual, thereby
							prolonging the heavy burden of their maintenance as well as the risk of
							their involvement in a new war.</p>
                        <p>The return of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces from
							Viet-Nam will open the way to a strengthening and restructuring of the
							ROK military and to the phased withdrawal of the bulk of US forces from
							Korea. It will not be difficult to make <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ground forces—and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> navy—more than a match for the North Korean army and
							navy. In fact, the North Koreans may already be overmatched on the
							ground and the sea, though there is not the margin of safety one might
							wish. A <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ground force of about 20
							divisions (equivalent to what they would now have if the two divisions
							in Viet-Nam returned to replace the two US divisions in Korea), modest
							equipment modernization, and improved logistic infrastructure are
							needed.</p>
                        <p>The balance is quite different in the air. The North Koreans acquired a
							large air force after (and in violation of) the Armistice, while the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has leaned heavily on US air
							support. Although the US could bring the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to “parity” in air strength, it is probably unnecessary
							and undesirable. Unnecessary, because much of the North Korean air force
							is obsolete and of dubious effectiveness in supporting an all-out
							assault on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and because US air
							strength would in all relevant contingencies be able to redress any
							unexpected reverses. Undesirable, since numerical parity would be
							extremely costly to provide and maintain and could simply lead to an
							accelerated arms race on the peninsula. We should therefore support only
							a modest expansion of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> air force
							from 11 to 13 tactical fighter squadrons and concentrate on
							modernization of existing units and improvement of base facilities.</p>
                        <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0467"/>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
							Remaining US forces would ultimately consist of headquarters staff,
							military advisers, and personnel in selected logistic units.</p>
                        <p>Our economic strategy will depend in some degree on which approach we
							choose in the security field. If we do not make an intensive effort to
							build up <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength, but keep
							our forces in Korea somewhat longer, there will be less pressure on the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy, and our economic aid
							can taper down more rapidly. If, as this paper recommends, we make the
							intensive effort, there may be corresponding strains on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and our aid phase-out should probably
							be somewhat deferred. Moreover, there are still major uncertainties in
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s economic future and we should
							terminate Development Loans and Military Budget Support only after the
							critical presidential election of 1971.</p>
                        <p>We still have some influence on political decisions in Seoul, and we
							should retain the tools which give us that influence until the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is past the 1971 hurdle. We should
							recognize, however, that our position is already very different from
							that of some years ago and should not try to transform our old role as a
							flying instructor into that of a permanent copilot.</p>
                        <p>The major steps in carrying out the preferred strategy might look
							something like the following:</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1970. Return of one <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> division from Viet-Nam and phase-out of
							supporting assistance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1971. Return of remaining <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops from Viet-Nam, making possible
							the resumption of the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer
							Program.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1972. Development Loans and Military
							Budget Support phased out. Shift of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							to soft-term credit sales begun. The US 2nd Division would be withdrawn
							from Korea. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command might at this
							point relinquish operational control of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, except in emergencies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1973. PL 480 local currency sales
							ended and remaining PL 480 sales made on long-term dollar basis. The US
							7th Division would be withdrawn from Korea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1974. PL 480 Title II program (rural
							development) ended.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1975. Modernization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military structure substantially
							completed. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
								declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>All of these steps of course, depend to various degrees, on developments
							in the interim.</p>
                        <p>Several major questions may fairly be raised concerning the preferred
							strategy: Would the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> accept it? Would
							it increase the risk of a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> attempt to
							re-unify Korea by force? Could the required resources be found for the
							projected build-up of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defensive
							capabilities? And, finally, what about the Chinese threat?</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>Concerning the first question, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							leaders will be unhappy over the withdrawal of the two US divisions and
							the prospect that other forces would eventually follow, but in time they
							would realize that they had no rational alternative but to go along.</p>
                        <p>The danger of a “March North” seems minimal: there are few fanatics among
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders, and we can probably
							continue to rely on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> dependence on US
							logistic support to inhibit any rash adventures. We should, however,
							support a primarily defensive posture for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, and we should continue to make clear that our
							guarantee does not apply to hostilities arising from <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> attack.</p>
                        <p>The resources problem may be the most difficult of all, but its solution
							would be facilitated after the end of major hostilities in Viet-Nam by
							the withdrawal of the US divisions from Korea, which will result in very
							large savings and will more than offset the added expenditures required
							by the preferred strategy. Also, the ability of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to pay for its own defense is
							increasing, modest amounts of non-lethal military assistance may be
							forthcoming from Japan, and any excess equipment after Viet-Nam would
							further reduce costs.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, Chinese participation in a new attack seems unlikely, so
							long as the US maintains its present security commitment to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, backed up by both a nuclear deterrent
							and the ability to deploy forces to Korea if the need arises. The
							strategy proposed here would increase the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s ability to fight a delaying action against a combined
							Chinese-North Korean attack, but even a very large build-up of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> capabilities at great expense to both
							the US and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> could not eliminate
							the need for US combat forces.</p>
                        <p>No strategy is without its problems including the one advanced here. This
							strategy nevertheless offers the best hope of reducing our vulnerability
							to direct involvement in any new Korean war without making such a war
							any more likely than it is today. We would preserve our major interests
							in Korea while moving to a new relationship in which the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is no longer a dependent client but a
							full-fledged, self-reliant ally.</p>

                        <p>Washington, June 18, 1968.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Deployments to Vietnam</p>
                        <p>Last fall, the South Korean Government agreed to deploy an additional
							light division to South Vietnam. They proposed to send 5,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilians to replace an equal number of
							present support troops. In addition, 6,000 combat troops were to be sent
							to make up the light division total of 11,000.</p>
                        <p>During the conversations in Honolulu, President Park reaffirmed the
							commitment to supply additional combat forces but contended that it was
							not feasible for him to proceed to secure the National Assembly's
							support for this deployment at this time. He urged, however, that we go
							ahead with the deployment of 5,000 <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							civilians and the conversion of that number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> support forces to the combat role.</p>
                        <p>Intelligence reports indicate that Park's assessment of the political
							situation eliminates any chance that he will dispatch additional combat
							forces to Vietnam now or within the foreseeable future. However, the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government continues to press us
							to agree that they should <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0470"/>send
							the 5,000 civilians to Vietnam. It seems clear that they view this
							arrangement as a way to obtain high paying jobs and to earn additional
							foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>Korean Defense Minister <persName>Choi</persName> raised this matter with
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> and Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> during his visit here
							last month.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">
                                <persName>Choi</persName> visited the United States May 27 and 28.
								Documentation covering that visit is in the Washington National
								Records Center, RG 330, <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>/OASD/ISA
								Files: FRC 73 A 1250, Korea 337.</note> In response to his argument
							that the question of the 6,000 additional combat troops could be dealt
							with separately and later, he was told that this decision could only be
							made by the President.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that we not now agree to the dispatch of these
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilians and that this
							be delayed until such time as the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Government is prepared to send additional combat troops. This
							recommendation is supported by the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. These 5,000 civilians have always been part of the package for an
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> light division of 11,000
							men. If the package is now divided and the civilians separately
							approved, the chances, already slim, of later obtaining the additional
							6,000 combat troops, are probably much diminished.</p>
                        <p>2. Because the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s view this as a
							monetary transaction, they have asked for comparatively high pay scales
							for these civilians. At their “asking” price, the total wages for 5,000
							additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilians would cost the
							U.S. about $22 million annually. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> thinks it would take at least $15 to $18 million
							annually to satisfy <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> political and
							economic requirements. However, Ambassador Bunker and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> recommend we pay no more than
							$4 to $5 million annually. Wages for a comparable number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military personnel in Vietnam,
							including overseas allowances paid by the U.S. and base pay and
							allowances paid by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government,
							would be about $5 million annually. Wages paid in Korea for a comparable
							number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilians in equivalent
							jobs would be about $4 million annually. The Korean asking price for the
							lowest grade civilian would be about $4,000 per year, compared with
							about $800 per year earned by a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							soldier in Vietnam for an equivalent job and about $600 per year earned
							by a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> civilian in Korea in a
							comparable position.</p>
                        <p>We continue to receive congressional and public criticism of U.S.
							payments to Korean troops and civilians currently in Vietnam. We are
							criticized for hiring “mercenaries” and for giving Korean civilians
							preferential consideration over U.S. and other <gloss target="#t_TCN1">TCN</gloss> personnel. If we now accede to either the Korean asking
							price or Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>'s
							recommendation, the resultant bonus paid to these additional Korean <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0471"/>civilians in Vietnam could
							generate more public and congressional criticism at home.</p>
                        <p>3. Combat equipment for 5,000 additional <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be required. This is equipment identical
							with that which we are attempting to provide to the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces on a priority basis and any
							provision to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would result in a
							one-for-one slippage in the timing of our efforts to make the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> capable of assuming a larger role in
							the war. This problem of priorities would also exist in the follow-on
							support for these forces.</p>
                        <p>The major equipment for a full <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> light

                        <p>The posture of the North Korean regime remains extremely hostile, but
							there are no discernible indications that they are considering an
							all-out attack on South Korea or even a large-scale provocation of some
								sort.<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">The Embassy prepared frequent
								reports on North Korean infiltration and subversive activities.
								Those assessments are in the National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 KOR S.</note> The frequency of
							incidents along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, which had been
							considerably lower this year than last, has risen in recent weeks. The
							character of these incidents has, however, not altered.</p>
                        <p>Despite the continued propaganda attacks on US and our South Korean
								“puppets”,<note n="3" xml:id="d204fn3">An analysis of North Korean
								propaganda efforts revealed increased activity “designed largely to
								provoke anti-American sentiment and to enhance the image of the
									<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.” (Intelligence Note 424,
								June 3; ibid.)</note> we have not observed any changes in North
							Korean military dispositions which would indicate that an attack is
							likely. Their posture is such that we might have little or no warning of
							an attack over the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> but its prospects
							for success would be dim. President <hi rend="italic">Pak</hi> and his
							colleagues, who were extremely nervous some months ago, now seem
							confident that the US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces can
							handle any contingency. Talk of an “Israeli-type” lightning blow from
							the North is less frequently heard. Nor are the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s talking about the need to retaliate against
							provocations.</p>
                        <p>Provocative infiltrations through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
							and attacks on our patrols have continued, but the incident and casualty
							rates since February are well below 1967. Small groups sent to
							reconnoiter military targets are most common. Infiltrations by sea, a
							real worry last year, have been close to zero this summer, though a few
							may have taken place undetected. Since late July <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> incidents have increased in frequency but it is too
							soon to say if this is a brief flurry or a disquieting trend.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we do not believe the North Koreans are planning any large-scale
							operation which would risk provoking a war. Tension remains high,
							however, and the Intelligence Community is keeping the closest watch on
							the situation.</p>

                            <item>PL–480 Rice for Korea</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>You asked me to look further into the Purcell amendment and the rice
							package for Korea. The Purcell amendment requires, in the case of the
							PL–480 credit portion of the sale, that the Koreans make an additional
							cash payment to cover U.S. expenses and other specified uses, unless you
							determine this would be inconsistent with the objectives of the Act.</p>
                        <p>The recommendation is that you so determine. These are the reasons:</p>
                        <p>1. The PL–480 rice is part of a 400,000 ton package that has an
							exceptionally good commercial portion.</p>
                        <p>—245,000 pounds, valued at almost $42 million, is under PL–480 terms:
							This includes the usual 5 percent cash down payment and the balance
							payable in dollars over forty years. In itself this is a shift for Korea
							from local currency to dollar repayable terms. This shift is in
							accordance with the objectives of the Act.</p>
                        <p>—100,000 tons, valued at $17 million, is a straight commercial CCC
							transaction repayable in dollars in three years, one-third each
							year.</p>
                        <p>—55,000 tons, valued at $9 million, is for cash.</p>
                        <p>2. It would have been possible to apply the straight cash portion of the
							transaction to the PL–480 part of the package. This would have met the
							Purcell amendment requirement but would have been less advantageous to
							us. We would have gotten these dollar receipts over the course of a year
							but under the present package, we receive the cash payment immediately.
							Furthermore, the commercial part of the package would be smaller. This
							would be inconsistent with the stated objective in the Act to build up
							commercial markets.</p>
                        <p>3. As the previous memo pointed out,<note n="2" xml:id="d205fn2">Reference is to an October 2 memorandum with attachments from
									<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to President
									<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. (Ibid.)</note>
							we are competing with the Japanese. The Koreans, mindful of their
							long-term interest, might be pushed further but we cannot be sure. There
							would be a risk. In any event, there would be more delay and some
							balking at reopening what seemed in the preliminary negotiation to be a
							fair deal for both of us.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>
                        <p>Our prospective rice surplus situation is a further point. If the 400,000
							ton Korean sale does not go through, this rice would be added to our
							carryover at a storage cost of almost $3 million a year. In addition, we
							would lose the immediate budgetary and balance of payments gain of the
							cash part of the sale.</p>
                        <p>In the legislative history, Purcell and the full Agriculture Committee
							made it clear that the amendment was a best effort rather than a
							mandatory provision. Furthermore, in executive session, the Committee
							said that this and other amendments should be applied with maximum
							flexibility in the case of Korea and Vietnam. A Purcell waiver on this
							agreement should cause no problem on the Hill.</p>
                        <p>I believe that waiver of the Purcell amendment on this deal is consistent
							with the objectives of the Act and justified on commercial grounds. I
							recommend you approve negotiation of the agreement.<note n="3" xml:id="d205fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> added a handwritten

                        </list>
                        <p>Several recent developments have suggested that Pyongyang is trying
							harder than usual to be represented in this year's <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate on the Korea question. The <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>'s annual statement on the unification
							issue contained a softer approach to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">See IN–755, “North Korea
								States <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Position,” September 25,
								1968 (Secret; No Foreign Dissem). [Footnote in the source text.
								According to that document, the North Koreans traditionally
								“rejected the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s competence and
								authority to deal with the Korea question on the grounds that the
									<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was ‘reduced to a belligerent'
								in the Korean war.” They adopted a posture of blaming the United
								States for misusing the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
								professed their respect for the aims of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and insisted on being invited to represent
								Korea in that body as the only legitimate government of that
								nation.]</note> and an attempt has been made to have the
							representation issue taken up as a procedural matter rather than as part
							of the Korea question debate, with the aim of enhancing North Korea's
							chances of being invited. Cambodia, Syria, and other delegations
							friendly to Pyongyang have submitted a draft resolution inviting North
							Korea without preconditions. Should a North Korean delegate actually go
							to New York, Pyongyang's verbal aggressiveness might be abated somewhat,
							but adverse effects would probably accrue both in Seoul and in the
							U.S.</p>
                        <p>Better Behavior from Pyongyang? The seating of a representative in New
							York might cause the North Koreans to modify somewhat their strategy for
							achieving unification. Pyongyang's willingness to participate in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> discussion of the Korea question should
							imply an appreciation of the importance of maintaining a good <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> image. While the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> Government would probably continue to carry out <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> harassment activities and infiltration
							attempts throughout the South at what have become “accepted” levels, and
							would still hope thereby to undercut <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							political and economic stability, it may be more circumspect with regard
							to serious provocations, such as last January's Blue House raid and the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure.</p>
                        <p>Pyongyang's foreign relations could not but benefit from the
							participation of a North Korean delegate in New York, even though
							substantive <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> positions in the Korea
							debate would gain little support. <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0476"/>Assuming its envoy would be able to carry out his
							ceremonial and propaganda responsibilities without any serious gaffes,
							his mere presence in New York would be regarded by many new nations in
							the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—nations which did not exist at the
							time of the Korean war and have little appreciation of the roots of the
							Korean problem—as tantamount to an official UN stamp of legitimacy for
							the Pyongyang regime.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Repercussions in Seoul</hi>. Since Koreans generally
							are more concerned with the matter of representation per se than with
							the substance of the Korea question in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a decision to permit North Korean representation would
							have a traumatic impact in South Korea. For years the Seoul press has
							been apprehensive about the so-called “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							formula” for achieving unification, on grounds that unification cannot
							possibly be realized through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and
							also that continued, unimaginative reliance on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government will eventually redound to Pyongyang's
							advantage. Despite their lack of constructive alternatives to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> formula, the Government's critics would
							give forth with loud cries of “we told you so.” Indeed, it may be
							expected that Pyongyang's strategy in trying to have its representative
							invited to New York includes its hopes that such an occurrence would
							cause the South Korean people to lose faith in their government's
							ability to defend <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> interests in the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—and in the willingness of the US
							to help protect those interests.</p>
                        <p>We could anticipate, moreover, that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government would try to pass off much of the
							responsibility for such a debacle onto the US. There would certainly be
							some degree of official unhappiness expressed to us through the Foreign
							Ministry. The South Koreans tend to believe that their acceptance of US
							advice on the handling of the invitation issue each year entitles them
							to hold us responsible for the voting results. This problem is
							compounded by the tendency of Kim Yong-sik, Chief <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Observer in New York, to submit vague
							and self-serving reports to Seoul regarding his role in the joint
								US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-allied strategy sessions. He
							apparently wishes to convince his home government, if necessary, that
							some decisions are reached without his concurrence or over his
							objections.</p>
                        <p>Problems for the US. Aside from the matter of US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations, other difficulties would confront us if a
							North Korean were to attend the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							debate. Not the least of these is the problem of his security. Between
							the Korean war and the events of last January, a group of
							super-patriotic citizens—or perhaps some South Korean residents
							here—would not have to grope to justify expressing antagonistic feelings
							toward a Pyongyang official. Anti-North Korean protest demonstrations
							could be difficult to control.</p>
                        <p>But beyond this basically administrative problem is the question of our
							stature in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and our prestige in
							general. We have long <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0477"/>resisted
							attempts by nations sympathetic to Pyongyang to prevent South Korean
							participation in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and, recently, to
							force a North Korean delegate into the proceedings. To many nations
							unfamiliar with the complexities of the problem it would seem that the
							US had finally lost the fight. Coming after the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure and subsequent propaganda exploitation of the
							crew, this would create more political and propaganda problems for the
							US, both at home and abroad.</p>

                        <p>Coordinated Intrusions. Two North Korean infiltrators were sighted in the
							morning of November 1 near Sosan on the west coast of South Korea. Later
							in the day, a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force sweeping the
							area killed two intruders in a firefight. A cache of equipment,

							platoon-sized North Korean <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0478"/>penetration. These incidents, and possibly the west coast landing,

							off a large area and had killed nine of the intruders as of November 8.
							The South Koreans appear confident of apprehending all the intruders,
							although the difficult terrain has slowed the task. There are
							conflicting reports of the total number of intruders, some of which put
							the original group at 30, while others speak of simultaneous landing of
							two 30-man teams.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">A later analysis stated
								that about 120 armed infiltrators entered South Korea in the
								November operation. Of that number, a reported 107 had been killed,
								7 were in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> custody, and the rest
								were presumed to have perished from exposure to harsh winter
								conditions. (Intelligence Note No. 53, January 30, 1969; National

									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 KOR S) The incident and

								their counterinfiltration policies and organizations. (Telegrams

                        <p>Infiltrators' Mission. Until these two seaborne infiltrations, only three
							instances of North Korean agent landings along the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> coast had been detected in 1968 despite
							our expectations of a higher number. The commando group was the first
							specially trained large group to attempt penetration of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> since the January 1968 raid on the
							Presidential Palace in Seoul. (In the January raid the intruders
							infiltrated through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.) The tactic
							of propagandizing villagers is new. It was evidently planned in advance,
							judging by the supply of counterfeit currency brought by the agents,
							their reported photographing of villagers and their requiring the
							villagers to put their thumb prints on a paper as a sign of allegiance
							to the communist cause. Supplies of propaganda leaflets and North Korean
							Workers Party membership applications were also discovered in the area.
							Thus it seems that maximum psychological impact was one of the goals of
							the North Korean team.</p>
                        <p>In a larger sense, the mission may have been designed to test the
							feasibility of winter guerrilla activities in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> patterned after Viet Cong tactics. The
							South Korean Defense Minister ventured this opinion in addressing the

                        <p>160538Z. The Korean Situation.</p>
                        <p>1. From all appearances, Kim Il-Song is accelerating considerably his
							drive to unify Korea on Communist terms. Coming at a time when the
							Vietnam situation is in a state of flux, Kim's strategy of subversion
							and terror could have serious implications for the <gloss target="#t_PACOM1">PACOM</gloss>. Realizing that trying to predict
							the whys and wherefores of Kim Il-Song's behavior is a risky business, I
							am, nevertheless, taking this opportunity to pass on my views on the
							Korean situation.</p>
                        <p>2. On the dangerous side, I see Kim implementing a Korean-style “Vietnam
							strategy” to foment revolution in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. For the first time we are experiencing in the winter
							months a surge of rear-area, guerrilla-agent actions combined with
							intensified <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> activities. This may
							well be Kim's opening, and what he may consider to be decisive, drive to
							establish a viable infrastructure of revolution in the South. I am
							confident that the South Koreans, with our help, are capable of dealing
							effectively with Kim's threat, but I am also concerned that his failure
							to subvert the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> may lead him to
							further rash actions. The chance that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s could be provoked or would be more inclined to take
							unilateral action is now increased greatly.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>3. Although we have not been able to establish a direct relationship
							between the actions occurring in Vietnam and those in Korea, I am
							concerned that events in each place may be correlated and coordinated in
							future Communist strategy and military actions. Kim probably has fairly
							accurately assessed the general scheme of things in Southeast Asia. He
							will use every opportunity originating in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> to increase tension in Northeast Asia. For instance,
							there is considerable uncertainty regarding North Korean actions if the
							Vietnamese Communists were now to embark on a renewed country-wide
							offensive activity. The termination of hostilities and the resultant
							draw-down of friendly forces in Vietnam also could be viewed by Kim as
							an opportune time to cause trouble. The vision of a revitalized <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> power base could lead Kim to hasty
							action in a “now or never” drive to subvert the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> or even to attempt a reunification of the Koreas by
							force. This situation could hold a number of possibilities for
							miscalculation by the Communists.</p>
                        <p>4. Trying to predict North Korea's behavior, however, can lead us down
							some dark passages. There are constraining factors which are bound to
							inhibit Kim's efforts to unify Korea. He appears strong militarily but
							is not in a position to take over South Korea by his own forces alone.
							Kim speaks stridently and is inclined to take risks and there is a
							chance that he can miscalculate, but I do not believe he is wholly
							irrational. We can expect him to be deterred at least in some degree by
							the risks to his country and to himself of initiating open conflict.</p>
                        <p>5. On balance, we expect that Kim will do everything in his power to
							subvert South Korea short of open hostilities. He could become
							particularly dangerous if he feels his timetable for subversion is
							running out. My people are constantly and closely watching the Korean
							situation.</p>
                        <p>6. Very respectfully and warm regards.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> desired
							to discuss a number of subjects prior to his departure on vacation at
							Cape Cod. The following are the salient points of the discussion:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Level</p>
                        <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> expressed
							concern about the inadequate level of this year's <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, and felt we might face a crisis of
							confidence with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s despite the
							fact that such a crisis is not warranted. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> said that the change of
							administration might probably provide an opportunity for raising this
							subject with the new Secretary of State. It could, for example, be
							included in a “first ninety-days” issues paper. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> responded that he thought
							the Pentagon would go along with raising this subject with the new
							administration. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> continued that he had given considerable
							thought to various ways of filling the gaps. With the bombing halt, he
							felt that there might be a possibility to transfer Viet Nam weapons for
							use by the Homeland Reserve forces in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Two of his men were exploring this in Saigon at the
							present. Another idea would be to get some US destroyers to patrol the
							south coast. He said that he had a gut feeling that the other 16 nations
							who participated in the Korean War might be able to help, for example
							Australia and New Zealand could send ships. However he was not
							advocating this very strongly. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> responded that we would have to move cautiously on
							involving the Australians in the Korean military assistance picture.</p>
                        <p>3. Asked about the effect of this year's <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> reduction General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said it would probably affect the supply of 20
							light helicopters and cut off half a squadron of F–5's. Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> asked whether the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s might be willing to cut out
							some of the F–4's. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bone-steel</persName>
                            <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/> said he had discussed this
							possibility with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> but
							that they had not reached a definite conclusion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> felt that an approach to the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s on the F–4's would be a
							question of timing.</p>
                        <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> mentioned
							the high annual maintenance costs as being central to the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> problem. He thought that the Pentagon
							would support a restoration of this year's cut in next year's program.
							If such a restoration could be achieved, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> would give priority to
							replacing old artillery with new pieces. He would also fill out the
							F–5's that have been programmed for this year.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said he
							could use our support in pushing on the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> pipeline for Korea which he said amounted to about $200
							million. In particular he wants trucks moved more rapidly to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">
                            <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer</p>
                        <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said we
							should get the <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> Transfer Program back
							on the track. He recognized that our commitment to the Koreans made this
							difficult but that we might raise with them the possibility of
							transferring certain selected items to the Korean budget. There were a
							number of items such as cement on which there might be as much as a 60
							to 75 percent savings in costs.</p>
                        <p>7. After a brief discussion of the current status of our PL 480 local
							currency generations, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said that there should be closer coordination
							between consideration of economic development and defense requirements
							in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> agreed that we should take a
							close look at the local currency generations for military budget
							support.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Retaliation</p>
                        <p>8. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said that
							he had just received a cable from General Friedman reporting continued
							high level concern in the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> on why
							they (the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s) have to sit back and
							take all the North Korean provocations. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> felt that although
							President Park won't march to the Yalu, there was a continuing feeling
							in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that the punishment should
							fit the crime; he believes this issue needs to be given further
							attention. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>
							said that he continues to feel that there is a potential of carefully
							directed retaliatory actions by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							as a means to allow them to let off steam.</p>
                        <p>9. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> replied that
							we had discussed this subject with General Depuy, who had not been
							encouraging. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> responded that the General had never been in
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>10. (We showed General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> the Embassy's cable reporting President Park's
							conversation with Codel Roybal in which Park had <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0483"/>taken a more relaxed attitude about the
							North Korean harassment and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
								retaliation).<note n="2" xml:id="d209fn2">Not further identified. In
								early 1969 Pak remarked to <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> that “his warnings about <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retaliation were ‘for political
								purposes.'” Pak stated that minor infiltrations helped “to keep
									<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> units on their toes,” but
								admitted that if several actions occurred simultaneously the “matter
								would become serious nuisance.” (Telegram 44 from Seoul, January 8,
								1969; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–7 KOR S) In a
								New Year's statement appearing in the pro-government Kyonghyang
								Sinmun on January 4, however, the Prime Minister took a very hard
								line on the question of retaliation and emphasized his belief that
								the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should act against North
								Korean provocations. (Telegram 18 from Seoul, January 7, 1969;
								ibid.)</note>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">North Korean Provocations and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Counter-Infiltration Effort</p>
                        <p>11. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said his
							fundamental assessment of the North Korean threat remains the same, that
							North Korean aggressiveness is increasing, and that <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-sung</persName> is making North Korea an
							armed sanctuary. He feels that there is a danger of miscalculation on
							both sides and that the North Korean efforts are oriented to provoking
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s into retaliation. Such a
							situation could lead to more substantial moves on either side and blow
							up into major hostilities. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said that he had been trying to be “ahead of
							the curve” of the increased North Korean hostile actions with the
							limited resources available to him. He feels that 1969 will be a period
							of decision for us to reverse the curve. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> is concerned about an
							arms race between the North and the South and feels that the best way to
							deal with the situation is to be effective at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and effective in countering
							infiltration in the interior.</p>
                        <p>12. Asked how he was planning to increase the effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> defenses, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> said that he was trying
							out several new ideas for which he hopes to obtain Service funding. He
							said he had been working on scientific means to beef up the fence and
							that a joint US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> team was at present
							studying this matter. He mentioned that better lighting of the fence
							would serve as an effective deterrent and that the Australians had a
							device that would serve this purpose. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> also felt that there
							should be more US support to deal with the sea infiltration problem but
							he did not go into details. He did, however, mention his request for
							additional US security companies—a total of 2,000 men—and said that
								<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> was reluctant to take action on
							his request because of US balance of payments considerations. He said
							that he appreciates the US balance of payments problems, but wondered
							how super-sensitive this problem really is, observing that there was a
							limit when such considerations should cease to be an overriding
							factor.</p>
                        <p>13. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> also
							felt that it was important to have the Department's support on getting
							some more men to the regular US forces <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0484"/>in Korea. The four US battalions on the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> were having a difficult time and
							although our record was better than the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s in this regard, both he and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s were concerned about this situation.
							General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> explained
							that at present US troops were at 70 percent of strength and the
							strength of the <gloss target="#t_KATUSA1">KATUSA</gloss> were at 80
							percent. It would take 8,500 additional men to bring his forces up to 90
							percent of full strength and it would be most useful to effect such an
							increase in order to deal with the rear area security problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d209fn3">The Joint Chiefs requested an additional
								8,500 troops for Korea in January, in February, and most recently in
								October. (Memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, October 17; Washington National Records
								Center, RG 330, <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>/OASD/ISA Files:
								FRC 73 A 1250, Korea 370)</note> Here too, he felt, balance of
							payments considerations were inhibiting <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> action. He had discussed the matter with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> who had reacted with expressions
							of concern about the high cost of maintaining US soldiers abroad.
							Finally, General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>
							said that his fundamental view was that we must build up our forces in
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> now in order to withdraw them
							later on.</p>

                        <p>14. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> feels
							that the intelligence community has not evaluated North Korea on a
							totally integrated basis and strongly supports a new SNIE.<note n="4" xml:id="d209fn4"> SNIE 14.2–69, “Confrontation in Korea,” January
								30, 1969, concluded that North Korea did not intend to invade or to
								provoke major hostilities with South Korea or with the United
								States. The report maintained that during the next few years South
								Korea would prove an inhospitable environment for North Korea
								guerrilla bases and that the North would continue provocations
								against the South, thus risking retaliation by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces that could potentially lead
								to the outbreak of general hostilities. The actions of and the
								situation in both North and South Korea could be influenced by the
								position of the major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union,
								and Communist China—as well as by a settlement of the Vietnam
								conflict. (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_EAP1">EAP</gloss> Files: Lot 90 D

							a look at the North Korean situation, he has observed that the Russians
							are doing quite a bit more, notably assistance to North Korean
							airfields. He had also seen evidence that MIG–17's were being changed to
							MIG–21's.</p>
                        <p>15. General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName>
							continues to be concerned about the overall military capability of North
							Korea. He is also concerned about the congestion at our airfields which
							makes it difficult to flush out our planes rapidly. According to his

							aggressively bent on swallowing the South. Over the past year Pyongyang
							has significantly stepped up its provocative actions. South Korean
							patience is running thin. We are tied to South Korea's defense by treaty
							commitments and perhaps even more by history. Our military presence <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0488"/>in Korea still numbers over
							50,000. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
								declassified</hi>] Last year we provided some $350 million in
							military and economic assistance (plus the special $100 million military
							assistance appropriation you sought of the Congress).</p>
                        <p>We should be proud of our efforts in Korea. The Koreans have used our
							assistance well. Their economy is growing at near fantastic rates and
							the prospects for ultimate viability are excellent. Korean military
							forces are among the best in the world, as their 50,000 troops in
							Viet-Nam more than attest.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Objectives in Korea</p>
                        <p>Our objectives in Korea are:</p>
                        <p>—To keep South Korea out of hostile hands;</p>
                        <p>—To reduce the probability of large-scale North-South hostilities;</p>
                        <p>—To maintain a stable compromise among the great powers with interests in
							Korea;</p>
                        <p>—To increase <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> ability to defend
							itself;</p>
                        <p>—To promote South Korean economic and political development;</p>
                        <p>—To encourage a greater Japanese contribution to ROK security and
							prosperity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some Tentative Conclusions</p>
                        <p>The conclusion which I and the other members of the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> draw from this record is this:</p>
                        <p>There must be no question about the strength and importance of our
							commitment to the security of South Korea in the face of an aggressive
							adversary. But, as time goes by, it is appropriate to reconsider the
							question of whether our present posture decided many years ago is still
							an optimal one for meeting our commitment.</p>
                        <p>The answer could well turn out to be that it is. But the SIG believes
							that there is here a real and pressing question of national policy and
							strategy which will bear further examination by the next
							Administration.</p>
                        <p>—The Republic of Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) has made
							great progress in all areas. Increasingly, she has the strength—and
							should be encouraged—to stand on her own two feet.</p>
                        <p>—Our knowledge about North Korean military capabilities is limited and
							may not be altogether reliable. This raises questions about what the
							military balance—with and without United States forces—actually is and
							how, if necessary, it should be improved.</p>
                        <p>—Our present policy effectively ties down in Korea two United States
							divisions, which are not available for use elsewhere. They require
							substantial expenditures for support both in Korea and the United
							States.</p>
                        <p>—Our present posture leaves us little choice as to whether and how to
							become involved on the ground in the event large-scale hostilities
							reoccur on the Peninsula.</p>
                        <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0489"/>
                        <p>Whether or not we consciously change our strategy, the United States will
							face important decisions in Korea over the next few years. Sooner or
							later, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions in Viet-Nam
							will return home. We will have to make choices on the kinds of force
							structures—both <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S.—we should
							maintain. The prospects for the Korean <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>—so essential to our defense policy toward Korea—are
							uncertain and we need to consider whether to try to transfer this
							program completely to the Defense Department budget. Some of our policy
							options re- quire considerable lead time (e.g. <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>), and the new Administration will have to act soon if
							the United States wants to maintain these options.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Uncertainties</p>
                        <p>There are a number of uncertainties which hinder reaching definitive
							conclusions on any changes in policy:</p>
                        <p>—First, as already indicated, our limited intelligence makes it difficult
							to estimate the precise nature of the threat to South Korea.</p>
                        <p>—Second, there is the even greater difficulty of determining the likely
							effect on North Korean, USSR, and Communist Chinese attitudes,
							intentions, and policies, of any change in our military posture.</p>
                        <p>—Third, the outcome in Viet-Nam may affect the general climate in East
							Asia including Korea.</p>
                        <p>—Fourth, the 1971 Korean Presidential election raises serious questions
							about the continuation of political stability in Korea.</p>
                        <p>—Fifth, our position in Japan or Okinawa—now essential to Korea's
							defense—could well be eroded in coming years.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some Key Issues</p>
                        <p>The critical problem to resolve is whether it is possible to substitute
							improved Korean combat forces in whole or in part for our forces now in
							Korea and still maintain a combined <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-U.S. strength adequate to provide deterrence and, if
							necessary, deal with the likely military threats. This question in turn
							raises a host of subsidiary questions.</p>
                        <p>—Is the United States combat presence, 15 years after the Korean War, an
							irreplaceable element of deterrence against North Korean attack?</p>
                        <p>—If our forces are reduced or withdrawn, will we be politically able in
							the United States to reintroduce them should hostilities again break
							out?</p>
                        <p>—How much of a South Korean defense is needed to replace United States
							forces and what will it cost? What kind of United States force
							capabilities would we want to keep in readiness against certain major
							military contingencies such as a combined Chicom-North Korean attack?
								[<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>—Is it feasible to reduce the margin of uncertainty about North Korean
							military capabilities by a stepped-up intelligence effort?</p>
                        <p>—What would be the effect of a United States troop withdrawal from Korea
							on our position in Asia?</p>
                        <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0490"/>
                        <p>In addition, there are several subsidiary questions:</p>
                        <p>—To what extent is a “trade-off” between US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces compatible with our objectives for Korean
							political stability and development?</p>
                        <p>—Similarly, what share of the cost of its own military needs can we ask
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to assume without impairing her
							now very favorable economic prospects?</p>
                        <p>—And, finally, how can we obtain the necessary funds to assist the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in a multi-year program for the
							improvement of her forces?</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Remaining Efforts</p>
                        <p>I have listed only some of the more fundamental problems involved in any
							policy change. They are not easy to resolve. To deal with them in an
							orderly manner we need a more detailed look at these and similar
							problems. The <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> has commissioned an
							interagency group to assess them and to determine, as precisely as the
							subject allows, the technical, and political feasibility, requirements,
							costs, advantages and disadvantages, of various policy options in
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>The end-product of our whole review effort will be alternative five-year
							programs for ROK and United States forces and for United States economic
							and military assistance programs which can serve as the basis for
							decision-making by the new Administration.</p>
                        <p>Parenthetically, I am hopeful that the interagency study effort will also
							shed light on how to improve our whole approach to integrated country
							planning and programming in areas where security, economic, and
							political considerations so greatly overlap.</p>
                        <p>The Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Director of Central
							Intelligence concur in this memorandum.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the problem of
							rescuing the ship and its crew is considerably different from
							retaliation resulting from an attack.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what are the alternatives. The President said he was
							sure they included:</p>
                        <p>1. Hitting the North Koreans with U.S. forces</p>
                        <p>2. Getting a thorough explanation</p>
                        <p>3. Capturing one of their ships</p>
                        <p>The President said he was anxious to know exactly what happened.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he had no
							explanation other than the information that the ship was in
							international waters, more than fifteen miles out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that his
							department is studying the Armistice Agreement on the definition of
							international waters. He said there is a close relation to waters
							“contiguous” to North Korea, but the armistice does not define new
							international boundaries for the high seas. Where the ship was before
							the incident is unknown.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said this was not
							necessarily the case. Using a map, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> pointed to the position of the ship at 9:25 the
							night before and at 12 noon it was 25 miles off shore and 16 miles away
							from the nearest land associated with North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it was
							unclear whether or not the ship had strayed into waters near the coast
							of North Korea prior to the incident.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the North
							Koreans put out a very bitter statement charging the U.S. Government
							with spying and aggression. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said the North Koreans charged us with engaging
							in acts of aggression.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
							alternatives included picking up units of the North Korean fleet or
							units of the North Korean army along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or re-enforcing U.S. troops in South Korea. He said we
							could fly U.S. aircraft from the states to re-enforce units currently
							stationed there.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said if this
							incident indicates any new threat on South Korea, this would be
							[un]desirable because North Korean air power is stronger than South
							Korean air power. The opposite is true of ground forces. Another
							alternative is to send additional naval forces.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said this incident is one in a series of increased

							violations along the demilitarized zone.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief discussion of a B–52 crash in Greenland.]</p>
                        <p>Returning to the ship incident off North Korea, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said there was a period
							beginning about 10 p.m. in which <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss> is
							not aware of exactly what happened aboard the ship. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0494"/>said the commander of the ship
							did not ask for air cover or help or did not try to get out of the area
							quickly.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said at 12
							o'clock Korean time (noon) the ship encountered a North Korean patrol
							boat. The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> indicated it was a hydrographic
							ship when approached. At 13:45 hours the message came back that the ship
							was being boarded. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said the machine gun aboard the ship was not
							uncovered. The General showed the President a photograph of the
							ship.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said he advised the
							Senate Foreign Relations Committee this morning of information about the
							incident.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then read from a
							cable which was brought into the meeting on a session which Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had with the Soviets
							in Moscow. The Soviets said this was not their problem. They said the
							presence of U.S. troops in South Korea is a source of tension. They said
							they would not take action on the matter.<note n="4" xml:id="d213fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> met with Soviet

                        </p>
                        <p>The President asked what other channels are open to us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the Mixed [<hi rend="italic">Military</hi>] Armistice Commission meets at midnight
							tonight to discuss the attack on Blue House. We will raise the matter of
							the ship at that time.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what has been the reaction of the South Koreans?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the Minister of
							Defense chided us for urging them not to retaliate when they are
							attacked and yet now finding ourselves caught in this situation.</p>
                        <p>It is unclear whether our men were wounded by self-destruct devices or by
							enemy fire.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said the man who
							lost a leg was engaged in blowing up equipment. He said the use of the
							term “wounded” seemed odd unless enemy fire was involved on some of the
							casualties.</p>
                        <p>The President said we need to see what our options are in this
							situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he had a
							couple of people working on this under Paul Nitze.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the North
							Koreans may want to trade these sailors for infiltrators who have been
							captured crossing into South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thinks that this incident is related to the whole
							picture. He said he would not be surprised if something hap pened <pb n="463" xml:id="pg_463" facs="0495"/>in Berlin to coincide with what
							is going on in Vietnam and in Korea.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief discussion of the situation in Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> asked should the
							incident be referred to the United Nations, involving the ship.</p>
                        <p>The President said this would be protective and would show a lack of
							malice on our part.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said we might like
							to take this to the Security Council. First, we should see what comes
							from the Mixed [Military] Armistice Commission.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said the Soviets
							have their own ships of this kind including two ships off the Korean
							coast to keep an eye on the Red Chinese. In addition, they have one ship

                        <p>2. Since the fall of 1966, North Korea has been pursuing a tougher, more
							aggressive policy toward South Korea and the US. Pyongyang has
							deliberately heightened tensions along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, landed infiltration teams inside South Korea, and has
							been more aggressive in shooting incidents involving South Korean
							fishing vessels and patrol boats. This policy is probably intended by
							the North Korean leadership primarily as a demonstration against US and
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> action in Vietnam.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">See SNIE 14.2–67, “North Korean Intentions and
								Capabilities with Respect to South Korea,” dated 21 September 1967.
								[Footnote in the source text; see <ref target="#d130">Document
									130</ref>.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The attempt of an armed North Korean infiltration team to attack the
							presidential mansion in Seoul was the most conspicuous exploit of this
							North Korean policy thus far. Now the seizure of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> adds a direct involvement with the US in
							an unusually dramatic way.</p>
                        <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0497"/>
                        <p>4. In our view the two incidents were not planned jointly. The attack in
							Seoul almost certainly involved considerable advance planning. It is
							unlikely that the attack was timed to coincide with the seizure of the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, which did not begin patrolling until
							10 January.</p>
                        <p>5. Nevertheless, the circumstances of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s
							capture indicate that the North Koreans acted deliberately. If the local
							North Korean commander was exceeding his instructions, there was ample
							time for Pyongyang to countermand his actions.</p>
                        <p>6. What is known thus far does not suggest that the North Koreans are
							deliberately creating a pretext for hostilities. At this stage, however,
							regardless of whether they planned for it or not, they are probably now
							prepared to face a period of sharply heightened tensions. They claim,
							and they may believe, that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was within
							their territorial waters. They will undertake a heavy propaganda
							exploitation of the affair for some days at least. They will probably
							not release the crew or the ship promptly unless they judge that the US

                        <p>1. Senior <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> member should make

                        <p>Prior to the beginning of the meeting, <persName corresp="#p_CG2">George
								Christian</persName> raised the question of how to deal with the
							press. In response to his question as to what should be said about our
							going to the Russians with the request that they ask the North Koreans
							to return the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew, it was
							suggested that he say the U.S. has been in touch with Moscow, is not
							satisfied with the Russian response and will be in touch with the
							Russians again. The suggestion was made that the press could be told
							that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> was
							seeing U Thant this morning. As to what could be said about U.S.
							reaction to the incident, it was suggested that he say the capture of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, because it was a matter of great
							gravity, was being closely studied prior to the President's decision on
							his course of action.</p>
                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0501"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
							purpose of this meeting should be defined and further organizational
							arrangements decided. He felt that we should try to answer three
								questions:<note n="2" xml:id="d217fn2">In his phone conversation
								with the President that morning <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> raised the importance of the three
								questions. In response to the President's query concerning the
								actions of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo's</hi> commander, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied: “Mr. President,
								I honestly don't know. I called Nick [<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>] this morning and later <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName> [<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>] and said I think we need a Cuban Missile
								Crisis approach to this, and, goddamn, we ought to get locked in a
								room and you ought to keep us there, insist we stay there, until we
								come up with answers to three questions: What was the Korean
								objective? Why did they do it? Secondly, what are they going to do
								now—blackmail us, let it go, you know, what? And, thirdly, what
								should we do now? There are a whole series of things we've thought
								of here—quarantine them, steal one of their ships, etc., etc., etc.
								But we just have got to act quickly. I don't think we can let the
								day go by before reporting to you our at least tentative views on
								those three questions.” The President commented, “I told Walt that I
								thought we ought to have done that beginning at 2 o'clock night
								before last and yesterday and then today too,” to which <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded, “I think
								you're right.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. What were the North Koreans trying to do by capturing the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>?</p>
                        <p>2. What do we think the Koreans will now do?</p>
                        <p>3. How does the U.S. respond to this incident?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that
							an organization similar to that which handled the Cuban crisis should be
							set up. He felt we needed to close promptly the gaps in our knowledge
							and to gather the considered views of those attending the meeting so
							that recommendations could be made to the President before midnight. He
							said we must respond firmly and promptly to the North Korean action.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
							suggested an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of Deputy
							Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the seriousness of the incident was made
							clear by our belief that the North Koreans are not about to give up the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> soon.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>, in answer to the
							question of why the Koreans captured the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>,
							suggested two motivations:</p>
                        <p>1. To hinder the movement of Koreans to South Vietnam, and</p>
                        <p>2. To harass the U.S. in its conduct of the war in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>He referred to several reports from Bloc sources concerning proposals to
							open a second front in Korea. He also had a report that China would like
							to see the war in Korea reopened. He concluded that their present
							estimate was that the North Koreans would not reopen the war now but
							would make the situation as tough as possible for us. He said
							essentially it is a question of whether we or they have the tougher
							will.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> doubted that
							the North Korean purpose was to reduce the level of Korean forces in
							South Vietnam. He said that <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0502"/>there were 1,200,000 free world forces in South Korea, and that the
							risk involved in capturing the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was much
							too high if the purpose was to effect the level of forces by 10 to
							15,000 troops. He wondered whether they did not have another objective
							which involved tying down the U.S.—a much more serious objective.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said he agreed that one
							objective would be to create the appearance of a second front which
							would reduce U.S. freedom of action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> pointed out that the Soviets had this objective
							in the Middle East crisis but that it hadn't worked very well. Mr.
								<persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> called attention to the
							response of Soviet Foreign Office official, Kuznetsov, when asked by
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> to convey our
							concern to the North Koreans. He noted that Kuznetsov replied negatively
							without reference to anyone and without promising to consult his
								superiors.<note n="3" xml:id="d217fn3">As reported by <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in telegram 2550 from
								Moscow, January 23. (National Archives and Records Administration,
								RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
								33–6 KOR N–US)</note> It was obvious that the Russians knew what was
							going on in North Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed that the Russians were
							knowledgeable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> said it may well be
							that the Russians assumed we could not respond very effectively to North
							Korean provocation and that they agreed that the North Koreans should
							take advantage of the “target of opportunity,” i.e., the presence of the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> off North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded that
							there is a great deal we can do, including mining, conducting a
							quarantine, blocking shipping into North Korea, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> said that possibly the
							North Koreans wanted to create a second Vietnam. They knew that we were
							holding down the South Koreans who are anxious to retaliate for recent
							North Korean raids. Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> agreed that this was a possible motivation for the
							action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that possibly they
							were thinking that the U.S. would be reluctant in an election year to
							make a major response involving such actions as calling up the reserves.
							It is possible that they are challenging us and trying to make our
							problems more difficult. He noted that their action had already led us
							to divert the aircraft carrier Enterprise from South Vietnam by putting
							it into the Sea of Japan off North Korea. He said it is possible that
							the attempt to assassinate President Park was part of this plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> described the
							action as a calculated attack on a target of opportunity. He noted that
							the North Koreans didn't know the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was
							coming their way before the 10th of January. After that date they may
							have planned to capture it, acting when the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was off Wonsan. He said that what the North Koreans do
							now depends a <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0503"/>great deal on
							what the U.S. does. He doubted that the North Koreans would return the
							ship or the crew.</p>
                        <p>The North Koreans, according to an intercept, will hold the crew for ten
							days at least in order to interrogate them. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> noted that the North Koreans
							had held some of our pilots for a year and had treated them very roughly
							before releasing them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added that the fact that they will be holding
							the U.S. crew increases the seriousness of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said the
							North Korean motivation might be their hope that pressure on us might
							lead us to take a weaker position on Vietnam negotiations. Thus, it
							might be necessary for us to ask Congress for additional authority to
							take military action in order to make clear to the Soviets that they
							must not misunderstand our attitude toward the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo
								incident</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said if their
							effort was aimed at tying our hands in other areas, they had succeeded
							since we cannot move in South Vietnam until the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident is resolved.</p>
                        <p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Christian</persName> and Mr.
								<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> mentioned the large
							number of telegrams from private U.S. citizens which had already been
							received by the White House. These messages, spontaneously sent, were
							demanding immediate U.S. action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> suggested that the
							North Vietnamese [Korean] action may have been timed with the North
							Vietnamese military action at Qhe Sanh.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> doubted the
							relationship. The North Korean Premier, Kim Il-Song, is opposed to
							negotiation of the Vietnam war. If there is a relationship, he did not
							understand why the Russians were opposed to doing anything about North
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said he assumed that
							the Soviets knew of the North Vietnamese action. Considerable pressure
							was being exerted on us, both in Vietnam and in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> commented that North
							Korea wants to be in the hands of neither the Russians or the Communist
							Chinese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> added that
							Soviet influence is more effective in North Korea than it is in North
							Vietnam. One far-out possibility was that the North Korean action was
							prompted by the Chinese in an effort to cross up the negotiations on
							Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> commented that
							the attack on the South Korean President's home had been planned for at
							least two years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said the most
							plausible position is that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident
							was a North Korean action which had been undertaken with the consent of
							the Russians and Communist Chinese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> restated his view that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident may be tied in with numerous Communist actions
							in the Pacific area. He added that the Russians may have been interested
							in getting the equipment from the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0504"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> said that the North
							Koreans may be stepping up harassment of all kinds. It could be that the
							Soviets knew of the North Korean campaign and decided against
							interfering.</p>
                        <p>All agreed that the North Koreans will hold the ship and the crew and
							that they will not respond to diplomatic pressure alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> reviewed some of the
							diplomatic actions being taken or which could be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is to see
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General U Thant at 11:00
							A.M. He is to try to interest U Thant in a solution of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident but is not to request the
							Secretary General's good offices.<note n="4" xml:id="d217fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> provided a summary
								of his meeting with U Thant in telegram 3481 from New York, January
								24, at which U Thant expressed a willingness to use his good offices
								to seek Soviet views about the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
								incident. U Thant told <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> that since “North Korea is '75 per cent in
								Sov camp'” the Soviets should be contacted first. U Thant also
								observed that the incident underscored his belief that the United
								Nations should have North Korean and North Vietnamese observers.
								(Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0505"/>
                        <p>2. We could take the issue to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							Security Council in order to buy time in which a decision can be made as
							to what U.S. military action is to be taken. There would be no
							expectation that a solution could come out of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. A letter from the President to U Thant might be used to give the
							Secretary General a sense of the gravity of the situation. The letter
							would link North Korean infiltration, including the Blue House effort,
							to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> capture.</p>
                        <p>4. A second effort to enlist the Russians in promoting a solution might
							consist of a Presidential letter to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we must
							first decide what we will do. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> pointed out that although Korean President Park
							has agreed not to retaliate for the present, the Koreans will do so no
							matter what we say if harassments continue to increase. General
								<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said our commander
							in Korea is already deeply concerned and had asked whether he should
							play the current situation hot or cool with the Koreans.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said he was not
							now prepared to recommend specific military actions but we could do any
							or all of the following:</p>
                        <p>1. Reinforce our military strength in South Korea and in the area nearby.
							We could send additional air and naval units to Korea and to areas
							closer to Korea. One question was whether we could use Japanese
							facilities in this reinforcement activity. If we can, it would make a
							great deal of difference. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> replied that we could use Japanese facilities.
							Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said we should
							consider sending a Presidential letter to <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> or possibly a Presidential emissary.</p>
                        <p>2. We could use our naval preponderance in the area, both surface and
							under sea, to do any of the following:</p>
                        <p>a. find North Korean shipping at sea which could be seized or sunk. The
							purpose would be to seize or destroy something of value to North Korea
							which was at sea.</p>
                        <p>b. blockade North Korea by mining selected harbors, either with standard
							mines or with MARK 36 bombs. Submarines could also be used in this
							effort.</p>
                        <p>c. punitive activities against North Korean coastal ocean-going traffic
							and the blocking of all such traffic.</p>
                        <p>d. air and naval strikes against selective targets. The port of Wonsan
							was a tough target because it was well defended. Railroad and <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> storage were other targets.</p>
                        <p>e. a raid in force on an isolated outpost along the Korean <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. Although General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> did not favor this suggestion,
							he said it would be possible to destroy such an outpost and capture the
							garrison.</p>
                        <p>f. photo reconnaissance should be undertaken before any other action. A
							drone unit had been moved to Okinawa and RF 4 planes are in South Korea.
							These could be used if weather permits. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said that Black Shield could be available for use
							within 24 hours.<note n="5" xml:id="d217fn5">Black Shield missions
								consisted of intelligence-gathering overflights to conduct
								photographic reconnaissance. A memorandum prepared by the
								Directorate of Intelligence, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>,
								January 29, assessing the results of the Black Shield mission over
								North Korea on January 26 and discussing the photographic

								Incident—Miscellaneous, Vol. I.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested two
							general types of action:</p>
                        <p>1. A general military movement into the Korean area which would signal
							our present intentions and be an indication of things to come.</p>
                        <p>2. A buildup of U.S. military forces which could include the call up of
							military reserves and a request of Congress to authorize the extension
							of the terms of service of those now in the military.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said one thing we might
							do would be to direct the South Koreans to seize the Soviet hydrologic
							ship which is now following the Enterprise. This action would be
							symmetrical with the North Korean action and it would get the South
							Koreans involved in the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> said such an action
							would provide an obvious reposte; i.e., the Soviets might shoot
							back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> asked whether there
							was any merit in trying to get the ship back. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> responded that this would be
							very difficult to do because of the air defense around Wonsan and the
							shallow waters of the port. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said an effort to get the ship back would
							create psychological problems, i.e., that we placed greater value on the
							ship than on the personnel.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said that he
							hated to see a U.S. ship in the hands of an enemy. In addition, there
							was some equipment still on board the ship, <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0506"/>including a computer which would be compromised. He
							repeated that an effort to sink the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> by
							submarine would be very difficult because of the shallow water. An air
							attack on the ship would encounter stiff North Korean resistance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said there
							were three areas in which action should be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. on the diplomatic track;</p>
                        <p>2. reinforce our total military strength, using existing Presidential
							authority such as extending the term of military service;</p>
                        <p>3. applying U.S. military power in the area such as restricting foreign
							shipping, the use of mines, blockade, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said one idea would
							be to put another U.S. ship in the area where the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was seized and give this ship full air and naval
							protection. This would indicate that we believed we had a right to put
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> where it was, but also have a
							beneficial effect on U.S. prestige. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said the U.S.S. Banner would be available for
							such a mission.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> said that for some weeks
							we have wanted to know more about North Korean troop dispositions.
							However, the State Department had opposed a Black Shield mission.
							Current developments would probably alter this earlier judgment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said we should put in
							writing what we know about the incident, what things we are not sure
							about, and then instruct the intelligence community to focus on whether
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident is related to Qhe Sanh or the
							attack on the Blue House; also, whether the motive is diversionary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed with
							this method of proceeding. He thought we should have a plan for photo
							reconnaissance, including authorization of a Black Shield mission, by
							the end of the day.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said that at the 1:00
							P.M. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, we should be prepared
							to report to the President on the work already done—the intelligence
							situation, the reconnaissance option, diplomatic moves, reinforcing
							military moves, including existing Presidential powers. He said that
							military and diplomatic moves should be used to convey to the North
							Koreans and the Russians that they have miscalculated the effect of the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident on the U.S. In addition, we
							should initiate a military build-up on the scene.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> suggested that we
							must answer the question: “What next.” All agreed that before we start
							down the road, we must carefully look at where it will end.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> said the North Koreans
							will say that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was within their
							territorial waters. He asked how we could prove to everyone that the
							ship was in international waters.</p>
                        <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0507"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> noted that the
							South Koreans seized a North Korean ship some 40 miles offshore. General
								<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> added that this was
							a case of hot pursuit; therefore, would not be applicable to the Pueblo
							incident.</p>
                        <p>There followed a discussion of how we could prove the exact location of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. The ship had been on its track since
							January 10 but had maintained radio silence. It had instructions to go
							no closer than 13 nautical miles from shore. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> asked whether we could use
							intercepts to disprove the North Korean claim that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was within its territorial waters. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we would have to use
							such intercepts because of the seriousness of the actions we would be
							taking. He added that we would need the fullest justification for our
							action which would have to be based on proof of the exact location of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> when it was attacked. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> added that the North Koreans had
							83 of our military personnel to brainwash and possibly make
							confessions.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the photo reconnaissance problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> noted that one pass with the
							Black Shield was quite safe but two or three passes would make it
							vulnerable. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> asked what
							we would do if the North Koreans fired on the photo reconnaissance
							plane. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> noted
							that the North Koreans have been practicing with SAMs against targets
							flying at altitudes used by Black Shield. The drone would create no
							problem but its reconnaissance was of a limited usefulness. Mr.
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> added that Black
							Shield was essential.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> reviewed the work to be
							done by 1:00 P.M. and the papers to be prepared for the group when it
							meets again at 6:00 P.M. in State Department. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> will have the reconnaissance
							plan. Defense will list our military capabilities for action in the
							area. Existing Presidential authority will be compiled by Defense.
								<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> will prepare intelligence
							refinements including why the Koreans took the action and what their
							present intentions are. State will prepare the diplomatic options and
							the decisions to be taken in this area. State will also prepare the
							basis for U.S. action and its presentation to the public. An overall
							scenario or plan of action will be pulled together by State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> said in his view the
							question was whether the loss of a U.S. ship with its crew was worth a
							major military confrontation with North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that by
							this afternoon we would be able to narrow the options open to us to
							apply military pressure. We could probably reach agreement on how the
							North Koreans would react and what we would do, depending upon their
							further reaction. However, it is necessary to give the North Koreans
							promptly a clear message of our firmness.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Christian</persName> asked that
							consideration be given to whether the President should inform the public
							as to what we are doing.</p>

                        <p rend="center">PART I</p>
                        <p>The President: The Security Council meeting was set up before the ship
							incident. I want Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to bring you up to date on this matter. In
							addition we have asked Cyrus Vance and Lucius Battle for their opinions
							and judgments on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: All of you
							know the information which has been published. I will not go over any of
							that. We do not know what happened except that this incident was
							pre-planned. The earliest date on which it could have been planned was
							January 10 since this was the first time the North Koreans knew that the
							ship would be in the area.</p>
                        <p>Three things are clear:</p>
                        <p>1. It was a conscious effort to provoke a response or a lack of
							response.</p>
                        <p>2. The Soviets knew of it in advance.</p>
                        <p>3. The North Koreans have no intention of returning the men or the ship.
							I view this situation very seriously.</p>
                        <p>There are three key questions which are unanswered:</p>
                        <p>1. Why did they do it?</p>
                        <p>2. What will they do now?</p>
                        <p>3. How should we respond? The President: Did the skipper ask for
							help?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: There was a
							message from the ship “These fellows mean business. SOS. SOS.” His next
							message was that they were boarding the ship.</p>
                        <p>At 1200 (noon) the first North Korean vessel made contact with the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. One hour later, 3 other North Korean
							vessels appeared and several MIG fighters were seen overhead.</p>
                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0509"/>
                        <p>It is important to remember that we have harassments of this type all the
							time. The skipper probably considered it just that—an harassment—until
							between 1:00 and 1:45. This was when he recognized it as a very
							different situation from a normal harassment. At 1:45 he sent out the
							call for help.</p>
                        <p>Convert that to Eastern Standard Time, the first encounter was at 2200
							(10:00 p.m. EST). This was when he was ordered to “heave to or I will
							open fire on you.”</p>
                        <p>At 2345 (11:45 EST) <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> radioed she was being
							boarded.</p>
                        <p>At 2354 (11:54 EST) the first SOS came.</p>
                        <p>We ceased to hear from the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> 31 minutes
							later.</p>
                        <p>The President: Were there no planes available which were prepared to come
							to the aid of this vessel? Every press story I have seen this morning
							said that U.S. planes were only 30 minutes away.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Air defenses
							in the Wonsan area are extensive. If we had sent airplanes to support
							and intercept, it is likely that these extensive air defense measures
							would be brought into play. In addition, it is necessary to consider the
							time of day and the approach of darkness.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Aircraft would
							have needed to refuel in the air. Twilight comes at 5:09. Darkness comes
							at 5:38. There were only 3–1/2 hours of light. The Commander of the
							Fifth Air Force issued an order to dispatch aircraft but then reversed
							the order because of the approach of darkness and the superiority of
							enemy forces in the area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The North
							Koreans have a large air base in Wonsan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: We need to get
							together on these times. I have a document which agrees with yours that
							the first contact was at 2200. I have that the first SOS was received at
							2328. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said this was
							2354. I have information that the ship went off the air 0032. Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the ship went
							off the air at 0025. For a matter of historical accuracy, we need to
							determine what is the correct time.</p>
                        <p>The President: I want you to assemble for me all the facts on this
							matter. Until now, I have been under the impression that the ship did
							not ask for help. Get all the facts and document them well so I can
							study this matter further.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The negative
							reaction of North Korea and the Soviet Union was to be expected. One
							would expect the Soviets not to take responsibility. The reaction of the
							North Koreans last night at Panmunjom was consistent with what I had
							expected. There are two conclusions:</p>
                        <p>1. It looks as if this incident was pre-planned.</p>
                        <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>2. The Soviets <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have had advance notice of what
							was planned.<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">On January 24 the Bureau of
								Intelligence and Research issued Intelligence Note 67, which
								concluded that the Soviet Union “appears to have been caught
								unawares by the Pueblo incident,” based on a lack of evidence
								suggesting that “Moscow instigated the North Korean seizure of the
									<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> or that Moscow even knew in
								advance that the incident would take place.” In terms of Moscow's
								response to the incident, the report suggested “that the USSR wants
								to avoid all direct involvement in the present differences between
								the US and North Korea.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files, <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, 23 January 1968 through December
								1968) An Intelligence Memorandum issued by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on the same day rejected Chinese
								involvement and concluded that the Soviets were behind neither the
								Blue House raid nor the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. (Intelligence Memorandum No. 0580/68, “Confrontation
								in Korea,” January 24; ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President: What were the reasons for it?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It could be a
							number of things. They may be trying to put additional pressure on us
							with reference to Vietnam. They may be trying to open up a second front.
							I do not see much in it unless they had either of these two objectives
							in mind.</p>
                        <p>The President: Have you fully briefed the members of Congress?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: General
								<persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> already has talked with
							Senator Russell. He will see Senator Mundt, Senator Dodd and Senator
							Thurmond later today as directed by the President.</p>
                        <p>Senator Russell seemed satisfied with the explanation given him today by
							General <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>. He was unhappy
							that an American ship was taken without a shot being fired on our
							side.</p>
                        <p>The House Armed Services Committee was briefed this morning at its
							regular meeting. I will give the President a full report on that as soon
							as possible.</p>
                        <p>The President: All of the Committees will begin investigations of this
							incident once it cools down. Should we do anything to head this off?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Until we know
							precisely what we are going to do, I do not recommend meeting with the
							Congress. They are not interested as much in what happened, which I
							think has been explained, as in what we plan to do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: In my meeting with
							the House Foreign Affairs Committee this morning, they were outraged at
							the action by the North Koreans. They realize it is a very serious
							matter. They were understanding and were not pushing any particular
							course of action.</p>
                        <p>The President: What other ways are there for us to find out more about
							exactly what happened?</p>
                        <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0511"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We will receive
							additional information for continued research by <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> on intercepts. In addition we will learn more from
							statements by the North Koreans and the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Leonard Marks: From North Korean press reports, it is obvious they are
							trying to create the following impressions:</p>
                        <p>1. They want to create fear among the South Koreans.</p>
                        <p>2. They are trying to create the impression that increased infiltration
							will take place.</p>
                        <p>3. They are making very flat statements about this being a “spy boat”
							which was carrying on hostile actions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName>: I would agree with
							what has been said. This appears to be an effort by North Korea to
							support the North Vietnamese in their efforts. They want to distract
							attention from Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President: They may also want to detain the Carrier <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The President then read the Reuters wire account of an alleged confession
							by Commander L.M. Bucher, Captain of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.
							The text of alleged confession is attached at Appendix A.<note n="3" xml:id="d218fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We should analyze
							the tapes to determine if this is Bucher. I frankly do not see how they
							could get a U.S. Navy Commander to make statements like that.</p>
                        <p>The President: Look very closely at this record.</p>
                        <p>(General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said this was being
							done.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It is
							important to remember that we did not know where this ship was prior to
							the time of this incident. Our best reports are that the ship was
							outside of territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The President: Is there much chance of error?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Admiral
								<persName corresp="#p_MATJ1">Moorer</persName>, Chief of Naval
							Operations, said there is less than 1% chance of error in daylight
							conditions such as existed at the time. The radio intercepts of the
							North Korean craft placed them in the same area reported by the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>: that was between 15–1/2 and 17–1/2 miles
							from shore.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName>: Our fix is 15–1/2
							to 17. Both of these figures are outside of territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The ship did
							destroy some of its classified equipment. We do know that not all
							classified equipment was destroyed.</p>
                        <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0512"/>
                        <p>The President: How much of a problem does that create for us?<note n="4" xml:id="d218fn4">On January 24 the Director of the <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> cabled two reports to the Special
								Security Office of <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> and the

								loss of the ship and its equipment. Regarding the effect on
								communications security, the Director stated that the capture of the
									<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> represented “a major intelligence
								coup without parallel in modern history.” Similarly, the overall
								loss and impact on U.S. ability to conduct signals intelligence was

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: This is much

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: The confession by
							the Captain appears to have been written by the Soviets. This is not the

							drafting it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The
							impression that the Soviets were informed in advance is supported by
							their actions in Moscow. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> went to the Soviets, he received a Soviet
							position on this quite promptly. It is unlikely that the Soviets could
							have reached [received] the information about the incident, conferred
							about it, and then taken a position so quickly without advance knowledge
							that the incident was to take place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName>: This is a very
							serious matter. It appears the North Koreans are doing this in support
							of the North Vietnamese against us. It looks, at this time, like
							collusion between the North Koreans and the Soviets. It appears to be
							another attempt to divert us from our efforts in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Last August, the Polish Military Mission went to North Korea. It was
							learned [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
								declassified</hi>] that the North Koreans have sent 30 pilots to
							North Vietnam. They also gave the North Vietnamese 10 MIG–21's. North

							more troops to assist the South Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
							said the Soviets are putting pressure on North Korea to take some of the

                        </p>
                        <p>1. General dearth of hard info on North Korea here makes it difficult to
							judge <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> motivations and interests.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">In the view of the Chief of Staff of the Air

								collector, embarrass the US and improve North Korea's image,”
								conclusions drawn “largely because of its plausibility and the lack
								of evidence to substantiate the seizure as part of an overall plan
								to initiate hostilities or motivated by other reasons.” The
								assessment discounted the possibility that North Korea acted under
								instructions from Moscow and fully rejected any involvement by
								Communist China. (Telegram from the Chief of Staff, Air Force, to
								the Strategic Air Command, January 24; Department of State, <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss>/IL Historical Files, <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, 23 January 1968 to December

							difficult for us to make judgement since we do not know how long <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in area and what its actions and
							equipment were.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident and Blue House raid are clearly
							related. Once Seoul raid had been successfully carried out, North
							Koreans, uncertain of what actions we and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s might take, may have desired to remove major source of
							information on their own countermeasures. In so doing, North Koreans may
							well have had Israeli action against USS Liberty in mind.<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">The intelligence-gathering vessel USS Liberty was
								deployed in the eastern Mediterranean on May 23, 1967, in response
								to mounting tensions in the Middle East that culminated in the
								Six-Day War between Israel and its neighboring Arab states in June
								of that year. While in international waters off the coast of Israel
								and the United Arab Republic, the Liberty came under attack through
								a series of misunderstandings and errors on June 8 first by Israeli
								jet bombers and then by Israeli torpedo boats. Although heavily
								damaged and its crew decimated, the Liberty sailed to sanctuary. A
								history of the incident was written by the National Security
								Agency/Central Security Service, Attack on a SIGINT Collector, the
								U.S.S. Liberty, United States Cryptologic History: Special Series,
								Crisis Collection, Vol. 1 (1981).</note>
                            <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0514"/>Although there has been some
							speculation that action was taken to provide KPA with major “victory”
							for its 20th anniversary February 8, it seems unlikely to us that North
							Koreans would have taken such grave risk for propaganda purposes
							alone.</p>
                        <p>3. While timing of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure is related to
							Seoul raid, there is complex of reasons why <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> would undertake both. In this, Vietnam plays central
							role. <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-Sung</persName> has long
							advocated greater Communist assistance to NVN and his latest
							pronouncement, calling for “more positive actions” to aid Hanoi, was
							carried by <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> on Jan 18. At time when all
							aspects of Vietnam struggle are intensifying, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> leadership may well have felt that they could make no
							greater contribution to Communist cause and to their own purposes in
							Korea than to take bold actions designed to reduce support in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> for augmented or even continued
							participation in Vietnam, to take advantage of current political
							difficulties of and to further reduce public confidence in Pak govt, and
							to shake mutual confidence between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Bold action could also, of course, create a diversion
							in Korean peninsula and force U.S. to divert military resources from
							Vietnam effort and stimulate additional domestic and overseas pressures
							against U.S. Asian policy.</p>
                        <p>4. Forecasting <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> actions is risky game.
							Certainly their past conduct in refusing to release our helicopter in
							1965 and returning pilots only after lengthy negotiation, plus their
							pattern of treatment of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> fishermen,
							gives no ground for optimism that they will react favorably by releasing
							vessel and crew immediately. We are more inclined to believe that they
							will attempt to exploit their possession of ship and crew to maximum
							extent from both technical and propaganda points of view. After these
							purposes have been ably served, they will probably return crew, but
							under conditions of considerable humiliation to U.S.</p>
                        <p>5. Although activities of past few days may cause them to proceed with
							caution, we can expect North Koreans to continue to carry out their
							basic plan for increased subversive effort against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> this year, especially if they are not
							penalized in some way for these two coups. Their propaganda is
							attempting to make it appear that major revolt is already sweeping
							South, which they must sustain by action.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The President
							does not now have the power to extend the tours of duty of military
							personnel without legislation. He does have the power to call up reserve
							units without Congressional action and without declaring a national
							emergency. It would be no problem to move promptly to Korea substantial
							forces consisting of Army, Navy, and Marine Corps planes (100 to 300).
							This would be easy and relatively riskless, and should be done. We have
							considerable flexibility in force movements, call-ups and application of
							force. We could also restrict commerce or mine selected ports.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: It is
							important to distinguish between symbolic movement of forces and actual
							use. The former does not commit you, the latter does.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We must
							distinguish between (a) the call-up of forces; (b) the movement of
							forces; and (c) the actual use of our forces. There will be time between
							the call-up of forces and the movement of these forces for diplomatic
							activity.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: There are

							we can put in about 300 maximum.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi> can be kept where it is and by the
							29th can be reinforced by the <hi rend="italic">Kitty Hawk</hi>. There
							are 130 strike aircraft on the two carriers. We can also bring in
							additional destroyers and <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0516"/>cruisers. Some would have to cross the Pacific, but we could end up
							with a substantial augmentation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Was the alleged
							confession of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo's</hi> captain a voice

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: Yes, but the
							recording made in Okinawa was not good. The tape is en route here. The
							accent was American but the language was stilted and unlike that which
							an American would use.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Diplomatic moves
							available to us in the next 48 hours include the use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. There are difficulties
							but also much reason in the idea. The United Nations has had a special
							relationship to Korea, and there has been a long history of association
							with the problem. There is a preliminary obligation to refer the matter
							to the United Nations before taking military action. This is not exactly
							a Charter provision, but is in the atmosphere of the Charter. We did so
							in the Cuban missile crisis before heading for a military confrontation.
							It is one way of putting prestige factors in the refrigerator for a few
							days. Security Council debate affords a framework in which contact can
							be made with the other side without engaging major prestige. We should
							try diplomacy by going to the Council at once. We are not yet ready to
							move militarily to meet an enemy response to our initial military
							action. Council consideration could also afford an important breathing
							spell in public feeling.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>: We have
							a paper outlining two possibilities.<note n="3" xml:id="d220fn3">Not
								further identified. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>
								also prepared a paper containing three potential options for
								approaching the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>: 1) submitting a
								factual report to the Security Council; 2) requesting the good
								offices of the Secretary General; and 3) consulting with a few key
								members of the Security Council and with the South Koreans prior to
								convening the Security Council. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, January 24; National Archives and
								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>One, the Secretary General to undertake good offices to see what he can
							do through private talks. There is some indication that he would be
							willing to try. This would take a long time and any result is unlikely.
							Meanwhile, in the Security Council we might seek statements from
							friendly governments urging release of the ship and the crew. This might
							be one way of proceeding for the next two days in the Security Council,
							simply aiming for the series of statements with no other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p>The second possibility would aim for a resolution calling for the release
							of the ship and crew and might possibly inject the Secretary General
							into the issue. Many problems would be encountered in pursu ing <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0517"/>the latter course. We have
							seven sure votes. To get a majority is problematical. We would face a
							Soviet veto. During a Council debate, we would be able to mobilize
							support.</p>
                        <p>Special Assistant <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: In the
							Cuban missile crisis we did not get into the United Nations until we had
							made our move. There is a danger that if we go into the Security
							Council, we would find ourselves blocked from taking military action. In
							the Cuban crisis we faced the danger that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would freeze the status quo. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution might state that actions were to be taken
							without use of force. This could prevent or hinder our freedom of
							action. We also have to be careful not to get the South Koreans up in
							arms by a lack of adequate response.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: This is somewhat
							different from the Cuban crisis. Then, the presence of the missiles was
							not generally known. We were able to announce the presence of the
							missiles at the time we announced our action. Here, the basic facts are
							already known concerning the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> affair. We
							could work out with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that we would
							be bound not to act for only so long. We may even need a Soviet
							veto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>: The analogy is closer
							to the Tonkin Gulf incident. We convoked the Security Council, made
							statements, but asked for no formal action.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Is it possible
							to go to the Security Council even if we ask for no formal action
							without getting the Secretary General into the act?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>: Yes, but some would
							surely want to involve him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We would not tell
							Council members we did not want formal action. We might indeed want to
							press a resolution to a vote which might involve the veto.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: The question is how do
							we get out of it if it does not work?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: In the Cuban
							crisis, the OAS was insulation from the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Would we be strong
							in the United Nations on the issues in this case?</p>
                        <p>Legal Adviser Meeker: Yes. We could have used all force to prevent the
							capture, according to international law. No legal theory is wholly
							satisfactory, but here we have strong grounds—self defense—stronger if
							we first take it to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">Meeker set forth his analysis of the legal aspects
								of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident in a memorandum to
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, January 24. A second

                        <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I am
							concerned about the question of territorial waters, and our inability to
							support this without adequate evidence. We have January 10–22 to account
							for (in addition to indications that at the time of seizure, we were
							indeed outside territorial waters by a safe distance). The captain's
							alleged statement indicated he had been in territorial waters. Should we
							be worried about the “hot pursuit” argument? (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> said “hot pursuit” was not
							involved.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We might consider
							demanding that the captain be produced at the Security Council. We could
							be in difficulty if captured documents included, for instance,
							statements from the crew saying that they went under the Soviet guns and
							took pictures anyway.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I do not know
							whether we were in territorial waters at some point or not. Is there any
							concern that the log would show that the ship was in territorial
							waters?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We can, of course,
							produce the orders (for whatever they may be worth).</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meeker: The North Koreans claim 12 miles, as does the Soviet Union.
							Warships may not be subject to seizure, anyway, even in territorial
							waters if they do not engage in hostile action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: At the United
							Nations, at least there would be pressures to settle the matter. And no
							one could believe that the matter is likely to be settled unless we get
							our ship and men out.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Can we put heat
							on the Soviets to help settle this matter?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Yes, unless the
							Soviets want to open a second front in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: There would be nothing
							inconsistent in taking the first two actions recommended by Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, i.e., calling up
							forces and moving forces, and also taking our case to the United
							Nations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That is agreed. We
							must be braced for anything. The call-up of forces makes our diplomacy
							more creditable. For instance, the call-up of reserves had an immediate
							effect on the Russians in the Berlin crisis.</p>
                        <p>If we go to the United Nations, can we be entrapped by the other side
							taking no action while we end up being inhibited in taking the actions
							we want to?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>: This danger should
							prove to be manageable in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
							Probably the most we would encounter would be a resolution inhibiting in
							a general sense our action, but we could probably avoid even that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: If we go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, it is essential to include the attempt
							to assassinate President Park.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0519"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The first thing to
							do tonight is to get off a telegram to the Koreans asking them to agree
							to a letter to the Security Council on both subjects. Then we can talk
							with New York about when to convene the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>: We need a period to
							quiet down the feelings which have been engendered. Going to the
							Security Council would be the best avenue to do this. I do not know how
							strong our case would be. The North Koreans would probably continue to
							say that we had violated their territorial waters. It is possible that
							they might build a better case than we could. If we move precipitately
							with military force, it might turn out that we had a hard case to prove.
							Submission of our case to the Security Council has the value of doing
							something, of recognizing that world body, and of permitting the
							American people to quiet down in the next 4 or 5 days. This is possibly
							but the first in a series of incidents. This one is not as sharp as I
							would like to see it. We should get ready for the next one which may be
							clearer.</p>
                        <p>I am concerned about using this incident as the basis for major military
							actions. As in the case of the USS Liberty, this is not a clear
								case.<note n="5" xml:id="d220fn5">See <ref target="#d219fn4">footnote 4, Document 219</ref>.</note> If we can find a way out
							with face, we should do so. There will probably be a better case later
							on.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: If the North
							Koreans come in with conclusive proof that our ship was in territorial
							waters, we could say in the Security Council that we regretted that
							action and that now they should give back our men and our ship.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>: And about the attempt
							to assassinate Park?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: They should be
							called upon to stop such actions. If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate slops over to debate on Vietnam, that is all
							right, too.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was almost an unarmed ship. If we were
							doing something wrong they could have protested. We presented no
							immediate threat to them. In the previous case of the USS Liberty, it
							could have been an immediate threat.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: How long
							would we be in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Two or three days
							or we could spin it out longer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>: This would depend
							partly on whether we limit efforts to debate only. If there were a
							resolution, it would draw things out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Warnke: Does self-defense wear out?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Meeker: Self-defense after a time “wears out”. It begins to get
							stale.</p>
                        <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0520"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We have a much
							cleaner case than <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>
							implied. But if we go to the United Nations, it is important that we not
							go defensively.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I am
							reluctant to use military force unless we see what we gain and what we
							lose. I believe we have a good case. If our people do, too, and we do
							not react, there could be a serious effect on the Vietnam situation. It
							is not clear what would come after the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Time spent in the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> costs less than time spent any
							other way.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The pressure on us
							is that our men and our ship are in Wonsan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: If the talk
							in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> goes on for two months, then we
							can't use military force. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is okay
							if it is not dragged out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: We have to move forces
							so as to act as a counter force to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							Talks. We should let the Soviet Union know that we base our actions on
							the doctrine of self defense. This doctrine will be part of our case in
							deciding what action must follow if we do not get satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: A telegram from
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> says that the
							two incidents (<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and attack on Park) are
							clearly related.<note n="6" xml:id="d220fn6">
                                <ref target="#d219">Document 219</ref>.</note> The North Koreans
							will keep up harassments. Then they will probably return the ship and
							personnel but under circumstances which will make it as humiliating as
							possible for the United States. This could result in undermining our
							support in South Vietnam. Porter expects increased penetration and
							subversive activities by North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> should draft a message to Seoul so that tomorrow
							we can go to the Security Council. We should also send a circular cable
							to the Korean troop club. If the situation leads to renewed fighting
							between North and South Korea, we want these people to be interested and
							to get nervous. We want them to say something to the Russians or to the
							North Koreans or to any others where they could help build pressure. We
							should give the 16 nations full details.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>: We often brief the 16
							here.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: All right, plus the
							letters. We should talk with <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>.
							We should also probably make a new approach to the Soviet Union. We can
							wait for a fuller report from Prime Minister Wilson, but if that is not
							satisfactory, or if Wilson did not take the matter up with the Soviets,
							we should press hard again.</p>
                        <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0521"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: On <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>, the question is how it is to be
							done, since we will be using Japanese facilities if major military steps
							are taken. If we got General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Max
								Taylor</persName> to talk with Sato, it would be more dramatic, if
							that is what you want.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName>: We were thinking in
							terms of an interim approach to <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>, asking the Japanese to express concern to the
							Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Now let us talk of
							other moves. What sort of ship is the <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi>?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> is a COMINT collector. It is now on the
							west coast of Japan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: It would take about
							four days for the Banner to get into position off Korea.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We should not
							undertake this without ample naval escort and air cover. If there is
							action, the odds should be on our side. The <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> is now in port in Japan for changes of its codes.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Replacing the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> is
							in range as a gesture.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We might buy
							some time by saying that we are replacing the captured ship. Such action
							would add a risk but would convey a message that we are not deterred by
							the capture of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We might want the
								<hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> to rendezvous with the Enterprise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: If we put the
							Banner in the same place as the Pueblo was, it will demonstrate our
							right to do this and our power to do it. The disadvantage is the
							possible impact on United Nations members if it makes people
							nervous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Such action would help
							us in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Let us consider B,

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We don't know yet
							the intentions of the North Koreans. An air cap over the <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> would be necessary. We can't have disaster
							again. I understand that North Korea has substantial air power. Our
							cover has to be big. What should be the extent of our call-up of reserve
							planes?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Our purpose
							should be demonstration. There should be quite a few. We should call up
							at least 250 planes. Four hundred were called up at the time of the
							Cuban crisis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: I am not recommending
							it, but the most symmetrical suggestion I have seen is to have South
							Korea pick up a Soviet ship. There is one similar to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> in the region.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We would, however,
							be acting just as outrageously as the North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: Blocking the harbor is
							a warlike act, too. We do not want to appear weak to the American people
							by doing no more than beg in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The point
							Walt makes is well taken. It is not only the reaction of our people
							which we must take into account but also that of the Asians. The North
							Koreans have attempted an assassination, taken our ship, humiliated our
							captain. The Soviets do have a vessel doing the same sort of thing and
							we do not do anything about it. We cannot continue too long without
							acting.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: (In response to
							a question from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.)
							There is quite a bit of air patrolling in the Korean <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. There are also photo and ELINT
							missions from time to time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It is important
							that we make clear that what we do in Korea will not reduce what we are
							doing in Vietnam. We might pick up North Korean merchant vessels, but
							there are only a few such ships, according to these reports. We might,
							however, influence Japan in the direction of economic sanctions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: This might
							have political effect, but it would have little economic effect because
							the Russians would step in.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We should gin up
							our friends to make statements decrying the North Korean action. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should have an interest in this
							affair, too.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Secretary
								<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended the
							following actions to buy time: Adding 250 planes to those already based
							in the area and the call-up of 250 reserve planes with crews.</p>
                        <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0523"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> should join the Enterprise. Aerial
							reconnaissance should include the use of drones plus Black Shield.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: I recommend that
							we run three reconnaissance flights in one day and get it done.
							Seventeen minutes for Black Shield on one flight.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We must
							indeed fill in the gaps on our intelligence if we contemplate military
							action. If we have a three-pass mission the first time, there would be a
							very low loss rate expected. I favor the three-pass mission.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That is okay, but I
							have not been greatly impressed with drones.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: That is wrong.
							They take excellent pictures. Eight of the last ten have survived. One
							met with mechanical failure and one was shot down.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Another
							benefit in using them is political.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Do they take better
							photographs?</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: Slightly
							better.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I see an advantage
							of taking a quick look at Wonsan. We ought to have the Task Force
							examine items B, E, and F in the index outline. We should be able to say
							that we have checked these out thoroughly. We are not prepared to
							recommend yet, but we should at least know where we are concerning
							these.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: We have the wraps
							on South Korea now but we do not know how long we can keep them on or
							indeed how long we will want to.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: General
								<persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> has been urging
							restraint on the South Koreans who have plans to make retaliatory raids.
							South Korean officers have been instructed not to let General <persName corresp="#p_BGCHIII1">Bonesteel</persName> see these plans. His
							question is whether we want to play the South Koreans cool or hot. At
							the present time, he is playing them cool.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We should
							continue to try to keep the South Koreans cool, at least during the
							Security Council debate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: We should consider the
							Park proposal to take out by air attacks the North Korean training
							bases.</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by reading a memorandum from Bob Fleming
							on the network press coverage at 6:30 p.m. (Attachment A.)<note n="2" xml:id="d221fn2">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We met early
							tonight. We have received a message from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> in Korea. He thinks the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident and the Blue House plot are
							connected with North Korean support for North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We propose the following diplomatic action:</p>
                        <p>1. We should take this matter to the Security Council. In the United
							Nations there is a long and strong background for our position in Korea.
							This would gain time for us. It also would give the Secretary General
							reason to proceed with private discussions. I think we should take it
							there, although it is likely that no resolution will pass.</p>
                        <p>2. Send a telegram tonight to the Republic of Korea to get their
							agreement on what should be put to the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>3. Go to the 16 countries who as part of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces had troops in Korea. We should inform them of the
							situation and get them nervous about it. We should alert them to the
							possibility of a renewed crisis in which they are involved.</p>
                        <p>4. We should go to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> of Japan. He has substantial trade with North
							Korea. He may be able to bring some leverage to bear with North
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>5. We should go back to the Soviets and tell them that their first
							response was not enough.</p>
                        <p>The President: I think we should get Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> down here tomorrow morning for
							an 8:30 breakfast. Can all of you make it?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Secretary Fowler
							and I are having breakfast tomorrow to go over our positions prior to
							meeting with Wilbur Mills.</p>
                        <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0525"/>
                        <p>The President: Why don't the two of you come to the breakfast and then
							talk afterwards about your problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName>, ask <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to jot down his notes and
							recommendations. Tell him I do not have confidence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but I do have faith in him (Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>). I want him to know
							that we are not going to make decisions about things to put to the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> without him here.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We do want
							moves which will buy us time. I propose the following steps:</p>
                        <p>1. Proceed to move armed forces from the U.S. and other places in the
							area to South Korea and South Korean waters. I propose moving about 250
							aircraft in addition to those that are aboard the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The President: Why don't we move the Enterprise back to Vietnam. We do
							not want them thinking we are diverting from our responsibilities there,
							do we?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The
							Enterprise can remain off Korea without any effect whatever on our
							actions in Vietnam. It was going to the Gulf of Tonkin to supplant and
							not supplement any operations. We can keep the carrier it was to replace
							on station off Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President: Are you sure that we have enough air power and support to
							take care of the situation at Khesanh?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We do have a
							problem, but I am reasonably confident that what General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> and General Westmoreland have
							reported is satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>The President: What's the strength of the North Korean air force?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: They have
							approximately 400 jets compared to 200 jets in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President: How does the aircraft we are sending compare with the
							North Koreans'?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Our aircraft
							would be superior to the bulk of their air force. We propose to send,
							roughly 63 Air Force F–4's; 33 Marine F–4's; 50 F–100's; 50 A–4's; 30
							F–8's; 22 F–105's; and possibly some other aircraft. The F–4's and most
							of the other planes do have bombing capacity.</p>
                        <p>My second recommendation is that the President has authority to call up
							units of the reserves. I recommend that we activate selected Air Force
							and Marine units. There will be approximately 200 to 300 Air Force units
							involved. All of these units are in a high state of readiness. This
							would be calling up to active duty approximately 250 aircraft. These
							would become part of the strategic reserve taking the place of the 400
							regular jets which we will have the capability of sending to South
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President authorized the Secretary to begin making initial plans and
							draw up the necessary papers for the dispatch of the aircraft <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0526"/>to South Korea and the
							activation of the units suggested. The President stressed that he would
							authorize more than what has been suggested if it is considered
							necessary. He said he would prefer to have more than enough to take care
							of whatever job might be required.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I propose,
							although there is some difference of opinion on this, that we move the
							USS <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> in to replace the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> off North Korea. We are planning to send it into the
							area to join the Enterprise so that if we decide to move, it will be in
							position.</p>
                        <p>If we decide to replace the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> we should be prepared to cover it with air
							and other support units.</p>
                        <p>The President: First, Bob, I want you to be prepared to move and be ready
							to make these decisions effective after the breakfast tomorrow
							morning.</p>
                        <p>2. Take the tentative steps which are required to get ready for this
							action.</p>
                        <p>3. I would send 300 planes. Get more than you think you really need.</p>
                        <p>“Be ready to go when you come out of this meeting.”</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We also would
							like to send Oxcart flight over North Korea tomorrow. The President
							approved this action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Also under
							consideration is sending a drone over Wonsan. However this has not been
							recommended to the President.</p>
                        <p>If we put the <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> back on station, we must have
							adequate cover for it. A second incident in which we come out second
							best would be disastrous.</p>
                        <p>The President: What about the B–52's? Should we send some in?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: They can
							operate easily from Okinawa. Flying time is only about 2–1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: At what level do we
							propose to reapproach the Soviets on this subject? Do we reapproach them
							at the <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> level?</p>
                        <p>The President: I see no difference in this situation than in the one in
							which <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> messaged me raising
							hell over Israel. The President then sent Tom Johnson into the Oval
							Office to get the hot line messages which had been exchanged during the
							Middle East crisis.<note n="3" xml:id="d221fn3">See <ref target="#d219fn4">footnote 4, Document 219</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President read portions of Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s initial message to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> on the situation in the Middle
							East.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I think a message
							to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> from the President
							would be appropriate at this time.</p>
                        <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>
                        <p>The President: Go ahead and draft a message tonight for dispatch
							tomorrow. Make it strong.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> suggested that the
							message be sent through the hot line.</p>
                        <p>The President: I will not use the hot line on this. We will send it as
							quickly as possible by cable.</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>
							if he expected any problems during the testimony on Thursday before the
							Congress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: I expect no real
							problems, although Senator Tower made a comment today that he was
							disappointed at the appointment. The Senator said he thought the
							President would now also be running the Defense Department as he is now
							running the White House and State Department.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> if he had appointed a board to thoroughly
							investigate the Gulf of Tonkin incident.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes, a
							special representative was sent to review the matter. In addition the
							Navy appointed a special panel to investigate it.</p>
                        <p>We will have good men to testify if called upon.</p>

                        <p>104628. For Ambassador from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. Seek immediate appointment with <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> and inform him that with President Pak's
							concurrence we are taking Korean situation to Security Council.
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> has asked for
							Council meeting January 25. We know Japan will be prepared to support
							our efforts in <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0528"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We are also continuing our efforts
							with Soviet Union (this very secret) and others.<note n="2" xml:id="d222fn2">In a January 25 letter to <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> expressed concern about
								North Korea's raids into South Korea and seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, indicated that Japan would be kept
								informed of U.S. intentions, and asked that <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> “consider approaching the
								Soviet Union in order to impress on them your own serious concern
								with the developing situation and also to consider what approaches
								you might make to the North Koreans, or actions you might make, to
								impress on them the seriousness of the situation.” (Telegram 104284
								to Tokyo, January 25; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
								15–1 KOR S) In response Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> learned that Miki would speak to the Soviet
								Ambassador about Japan's concerns arising from North Korean actions.
								(Telegram 4998 from Tokyo, January 25; ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> replied to the President's
								letter by stating that Japan had been in contact with the Soviets
								and was considering additional ways Japan might assist in solving
								the crises. (Letter from <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>,

                        </p>
                        <p>2. We are also considering certain limited military precautionary moves.
							These would include movement of additional air and naval units from US
							to South Korea. Amount of US air currently in and around South Korea is
							minimum we need and we want to strengthen this against
							contingencies.</p>
                        <p>3. We are also considering but have not yet decided to move 15 B–52's
							from US to Okinawa and wish <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>
							to know of our planning and possible decision in advance. This very
							secret for his information.</p>
                        <p>4. We mean for time being to explore and exhaust all diplomatic
							possibilities before considering what further moves need to be made.</p>
                        <p>5. We recognize Japan's intense interest and indirect involvement in
							moves we make vis-a-vis Korea. We are not in belligerent mood and mean
							to make our moves carefully and deliberately.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>: We have just received

								incident.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">Pak's message was relayed in

                        <p>At the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> we can urge the following:</p>
                        <p>—Urge that the ship and men be returned.</p>
                        <p>—Urge the North Koreans to behave with respect to the 38th Parallel.</p>
                        <p>—Urge a resolution for return of the ship.</p>
                        <p>We must not do anything which would tie our hands in the United

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Going to the
							Security Council will give us time. There is a danger of getting our
							hands tied. The South Koreans also are sensitive to the North Koreans
							being heard before the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The President: What are the gambles we take by going to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: It is best to
							urge a resolution demanding the return of the ship. I do not recommend a
							resolution asking the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to condemn the
							action of the North Koreans. We should ask the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to support a return to the Armistice Agreements. Of
							course the Soviets <pb n="498" xml:id="pg_498" facs="0530"/>will veto

                        </p>
                        <p>It is interesting that Malik will be the Soviet representative today. You

                        <p>As I see it, we will get the following votes:</p>
                        <p>United States—Yes</p>
                        <p>Great Britain—Yes</p>

                        <p>Canada—Yes</p>
                        <p>Denmark—Yes</p>
                        <p>Brazil—Yes</p>

                        <p>Hungary—No</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> said France
							has always been with us on the Korean issue, but he considered it
							questionable whether or not they will vote with us now.</p>
                        <p>The President urged that we send a message to President Ayub Khan of
							Pakistan telling him that we definitely need their support on a matter
							of this importance. However, the President and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> noted that Pakistan has
							problems with China and may vote no.</p>
                        <p>The President: Was the <hi rend="italic">Turner Joy</hi> an intelligence
							ship? (This was one of the ships attacked during the Gulf of
							Tonkin.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The <hi rend="italic">Turner Joy</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							are not the same type of ship. They do have some collection devices.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Returning to
							the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> votes, Korea has been a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> matter since 1950. We do need Pakistan's
							vote. A Pakistani is president of the council. He expressed great <hi rend="italic">personal</hi> support for us in a conversation
								yesterday.<note n="4" xml:id="d223fn4">A summary of the conversation

								File, Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident,
									<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> Cables, Vol. I, January to
								March 1968)</note> He is in a delicate position.</p>
                        <p>There is another alternative. We could use the good offices of the
							Secretary General. He has indicated some willingness to do this. We
							could put a time limit on the Secretary General. In the Security Council
							we could do much the same thing (put a time limit on it).</p>
                        <p>I would take the matter to the Security Council tomorrow. I think we
							should call for an urgent session. We may not get a resolution, but it
							will take care of our diplomatic situation.</p>
                        <p>The President: Why did the Soviets say in this message that they have
							passed along our position to North Korea?<note n="5" xml:id="d223fn5">Reference is to telegram 2566 from Moscow, January 25, given to the
								President earlier that morning, which reports that Kuznetsov told
									<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> that the North
								Koreans were informed of <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s approach to the Soviets immediately after

                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: It looks like an
							added measure on their part.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, a resolution
							which would be hostile to the U.S. would not receive more than 3 to 4
							votes.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Do we push a
							resolution to a vote? I would think we would do this only if we have 9
							votes.</p>
                        <p>The President: Our primary objective is to gain time, to give all
							concerned an opportunity for reasoning together. It will give the
							Soviets time to bring influence to bear on North Korea if they will.</p>
                        <p>I want to raise a question about sending a carrier and other aircraft in.
							Doesn't this raise a challenge to the enemy?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> says in his
							cable that this action seems paradoxical. I think that is worth
							considering. How will the North Koreans, Soviets, and the Chinese react
							to the show of force? Won't it lessen our chances of getting the ship
							and the men out rather than increase them?</p>
                        <p>What I am asking is this: What's our objective as far as all of this,
							particularly the action before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>As I see it, our objective is to:</p>
                        <p>1. Spread out our actions before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
							show them how serious this matter is and to show them how we have been
							mistreated.</p>
                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>2. Give us time to try to work something out and to give the Soviets an
							opportunity to try to bring their influence to bear on the North
							Koreans.</p>
                        <p>3. Show the world we are not bellicose.</p>
                        <p>But there may be a conflict in our doing this before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and our sending new planes over
							there.</p>
                        <p>Can't the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi> take care of the situation
							for a few days?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We do need
							more air power in the area if we are attacked.</p>
                        <p>I see no difference between us having the Enterprise already there with
							increased air power available and putting in what we need to have to
							take care of the situation. We already have built up our position with
							the placement of the Enterprise in the area. To do what Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> has suggested (not
							putting any additional forces in there) would mean pulling the
							Enterprise off station.</p>
                        <p>The President: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, you look at where you are going to get units and
							tell me the minimum time that it required to move in an emergency.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I have all of
							that information now, Mr. President. In addition I have an Executive
							Order for the President's signature which will authorize the call up of
							the reserve units (Attachment A).<note n="6" xml:id="d223fn6">Not
								printed. The text of the statement informing the public of the
								call-up of Air Force and Navy reserves made by the President on
								January 26 is in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents
									of the United States: Lyndon B. Johnson, 1968–69</hi>, Book I,
								p. 77.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition I have two press releases which I want <persName corresp="#p_CG2">George Christian</persName> to review and change if
							necessary. The first press release announces the call up. The second
							press release announces the actual sending of additional units to South
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>We can move the USS <hi rend="italic">Kitty Hawk</hi> into the area
							without public knowledge. She is only two days steaming-time away.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs feel very strongly that they do not want to move the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>. It would be wasted effort to replace
							it with another ship. We propose sending 303 air craft to South Korea.
							We propose to call up 332 air craft.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: I would
							recommend not making public announcement of the call up. I think you
							should go ahead with the action without public announcement and we will
							do everything to settle this matter diplomatically. However, the call up
							will strengthen my position before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							and will show the seriousness of the situation. I do not see any
							conflict between the call up and what we will be doing diplomatically.
							In that I disagree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: As I see it,

							justifies counteraction and equivalent reprisal.</p>
                        <p>The President: <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>, I do not want
							to win the argument and lose the sale.</p>
                        <p>The President then read again the Thompson cable. He stressed the
							sentence “They (the Communists) always react negatively to a show of
								force.”<note n="7" xml:id="d223fn7">In telegram 2566 from Moscow,
								January 25, Thomson included this statement after commenting that
								“the presence of our naval force off Wonsan will make it virtually

								intermediary or quietly exerting influence on the North Koreans to
								ease the crises. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to the President, January 25; Johnson

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: Mr. President, this
							was not the lesson of the Cuban missile crises or the Berlin crises.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The North
							Korean air force has substantial superiority over the South Korean air
							force. If we have trouble we need to reenforce.</p>
                        <p>The President: But when we send out vast armada, won't the Soviets and
							the Chinese say that they must be ready to protect their little
							brothers?</p>
                        <p>Won't this really increase the tension? Is this a move to defer South
							Korea? What are we going to do after the aircraft are there? Where does
							all of this lead us?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I think we
							will be closer to doing something diplomatically with a call up than
							without. I would recommend the call up today. I would defer public
							knowledge of the actual movement of the aircraft. For your information,
							I ordered diverted 10,000 tons of bombs enroute to South Vietnam. We do
							not have sufficient bombs in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>However, we must announce the call up. This will leak. Men have to be
							called from their homes. There is no way it would hold.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I would announce
							the call up today. I would go before the Security Council with the
							matter. By tomorrow evening, we can announce that we are actually
							sending these squadrons to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: I would
							proceed with stand-by arrangements without announcement. We will
							parallel these efforts with diplomatic discussions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The President
							must sign an Executive Order. There is no way we can do this (make the
							call up) without public announcement.</p>
                        <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0534"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG2">George Christian</persName>: It would not
							hold to try to keep from having a public announcement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The North Koreans
							may have decided to make a try at South Korea. We must jar the North
							Koreans loose from the idea of taking South Korea. This call up may do
							just that (prevent the North Koreans from thinking about offensive
							action against South Korea).</p>
                        <p>The President: Bob (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>), we must assume they have calculated what our
							response will be to this. Will this action (calling up reserve units and
							sending aircraft to South Korea) jeopardize our position elsewhere,
							particularly in Berlin?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: No, we have
							other units here and a number of units in Europe. In this country we
							have aircraft we could move to Berlin. In my opinion, we are in very
							good shape. The 332 aircraft that we are calling up are cats and dogs,
							but the 303 aircraft which are being sent to South Korea are in very
							good shape.</p>
                        <p>The President: What can we do to bring Congress in on this?</p>
                        <p>We have got to have a good discussion to see if the Fulbrights represent
							this country. If they do, we are committing a grave error to send men
							out. You remember how much trouble we got into on the Tonkin Gulf
							incident.</p>
                        <p>I think that Senator Dodd, Senator Thurmond and Senator Russell will
							balance off what might be said by Senators Fulbright, Mansfield and
							others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The President
							has the authority to call the reserves. It would be valuable to ask for
							legislation extending the tours of duty of those now serving.</p>
                        <p>The President: That legislation would put the boys (U.S. troops) on their
							side. We must keep them on our side.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The best
							action we could ask for in the Congress would be for involuntary
							extension. It would permit us to keep on active service a sizeable
							number of highly qualified personnel.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Have you
							consulted with Congressional leaders?</p>
                        <p>The President: We need to go to the Congress on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I do not recognize
							Senator Church by the statement he made today. He virtually asked for a
							declaration of war against Korea. He is a hot Korean supporter.</p>
                        <p>The President: I am sure one of the reasons is that he has a Pocatello,
							Idaho, boy captured out there.</p>
                        <p>What concerns me is this. When we get the planes out there and all of the
							forces you have recommended, what do we do then?</p>
                        <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0535"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The lowest
							form of military action is the minding of the coast of North Korea by
							air. They do have some ports of significant value, but in Wonsan. They
							do have patrol craft at Wonsan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: What about grabbing
							some of their ships?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We cannot
							find any of their ships. They have only 4 small vessels and they aren't
							of much consequence.</p>
                        <p>The President: As I see it, these are the steps we should undertake:</p>
                        <p>1. Take our case to Pakistan and ask them to be with us on this
							matter</p>
                        <p>2. Send a message to Park. Tell him that the North Korean side probably
							will be heard if the matter is raised before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Bob (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>), sit
							down with the Joint Chiefs and see what we can ask of the Congress in
							the way of legislation to get an overt action by them in support of our
							show of force.</p>
                        <p>4. Get a letter to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>
							explaining our position and the need for their doing what they can in
							this matter.</p>
                        <p>5. Send a message to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> of Japan outlining the situation.</p>
                        <p>6. Put our view before all our ambassadors and attaches. We should meet
							again about noon (the meeting was scheduled for 1:15 for lunch in the
							Family Dining Room). I want to get Senator Russell's judgment. He wants
							the Senate to go back on record in support of what we are doing. Let's
							not let the Congress say we are going to war without consulting
							them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName> (Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>), let's get the Cabinet back
							together to discuss Ambassador Roth's new proposal. It looks as though
							he has sold the proposal to Mills. I am concerned about financial panic
							in this country. Roth and Mills think this will stop everything except
							the textile business.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Fowler has done a good job. Don't shove him. He is under a
							terrific strain.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Trowbridge went to the hospital last night with recurring chest
							pains. I am afraid he may have another heart situation. He had a heart
							attack two years ago.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then discussed
							the Executive Order which would call to active duty units of the Air
							Force Reserve.</p>
                        <p>The President: I would put in the letter to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> that “I do not know what North Korea has in mind
							but I do know that neither you or I want to increase world tensions in
							this area.”</p>

                        <p>“January 25, 1968</p>
                        <p>Dear Mr. Chairman: On previous occasions you and I have discussed with
							each other the duty of all great powers to exercise their maximum effort
							to maintain the peace. On this basis I am urging your most serious
							personal attention to the irrational action of North Korean authorities
							in seizing the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> in international waters
							in the Sea of Japan. This calculated action by North Korea is almost
							literally without precedent in modern times and cannot be accepted. It
							was engaged in no hostile action, it was clearly in international waters
							and was seized under circumstances which we find literally intolerable.
							You yourself have similar ships in various parts of the world, including
							at least one now present in the Sea of Japan, and could not accept
							action of the sort perpetrated by the North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>I was disappointed that Mr. Kuznetsov, in a conversation with Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, seemed to brush the
							matter aside as something which does not involve Soviet responsibility.
							This does not reflect the true responsibilities of our two governments
							for the reduction of tensions and for the prevention of conflict. This
							act of provocation by North Korea has created a deep sense of outrage
							among the American people.</p>
                        <p>I do not know what North Korea has in mind in this situation. But,
							recalling our conversations at Glassboro, I am sure that we must agree
							that our common interests in preserving world peace would not be served
							by increased tensions in this area of the world.</p>
                        <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0537"/>
                        <p>I am taking the liberty of addressing this frank message to you in the
							hope that you will use whatever influence you have in Pyongyang and
							press them to release immediately the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							and its officers and men. I hope you will find it possible to be
							responsive to our concern. Sincerely, Lyndon B. Johnson.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: I would like to ask
							a few “devil's advocate” questions:</p>
                        <p>—How much time do we use up by our actions at the U.N.?</p>
                        <p>—Do we have control of the time situation if we get involved in U.N.
							debate?</p>
                        <p>—What is the danger if we go to the U.N. for some sort of humiliation?
							(What is the possibility of the resolution resulting in some humiliating
							statements?)</p>
                        <p>—How much danger is there in a resolution for us? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: We are not in control at the
							time completely. We can say this is a matter of utmost urgency. We can
							say that we will <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0538"/>have 24 hours
							and that time is of the essence. We can control the time within
							reasonable limits.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we can wind up the Security Council exercise on Monday or
							Tuesday. Then we can knock it off or extend it according to our
							wishes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: There are less fish
							hooks in this if we do not go for a resolution.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We ourselves need
							time to get our aircraft and other forces to the area, to talk with
							Congress, and to give the Soviets an opportunity to bring their
							influence to bear on the North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I do not
							think the Security Council will tie the Korean incident to Vietnam. The
							non-communists will not want to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: We will not
							be able to keep Vietnam out entirely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: We just received
							information that a North Korean aircraft is flying to Moscow with two
							men and 792 pounds of cargo aboard. This could be equipment taken from
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. It is suggestive that the Soviets
							were in on this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Could <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> pick up on film the area where the boat
							is, via satellite photography?</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: We are programmed for that area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Shouldn't we
							send a vessel to the area where the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> dumped
							overboard its equipment to dive for it?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Based on radio
							messages, we have information that the North Koreans are diving for it
							at this time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Couldn't we
							get photographic evidence showing the spot where the divers are located
							and also the coast line. This would be absolute proof of the ship's
							position and the fact that the ship was also outside territorial
							waters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName>: If we send a plane
							up there he had better be ready for a fight. They have MIGs flying cover
							for the divers, I am sure.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The
							particular plane that we will fly over they will not be able to fight
							because of the nature of the aircraft. Of course, if there were other
							aircraft sent, there likely would be aerial interception.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard Helms</persName>: We will send the
							plane tonight our time, which is early morning there. What we get will
							depend on the climatic conditions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Do you think
							the stuff that was thrown overboard was damaged sufficiently to make it
							of no value?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I doubt it.

                        <p>The President: What is the answer why the Air Force cancelled the
							orders?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It was
							because of darkness and the time before darkness made the effort
							marginal. Also, there was a substantial enemy force there. So the
							commander felt he should not do it and cancelled the order.</p>
                        <p>The President: <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean</persName> and Bob, what
							should we do?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I would recommend
							going ahead to the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: I could go to
							the Security Council tonight and ask for an emergency session. I would
							call on the President of the Security Council, give him a letter, and
							release the letter.</p>
                        <p>The President: What do we do from there?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We've gone to
								<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. We've gone to
								<persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>. This will get the
							Secretary General in it. Indonesia, also, has been contacted. The
							ambassadors of the 16 countries which had troops in Korea are being
							contacted.</p>
                        <p>The President: How do we get the ship and the boys back?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: 1. We need
							authorization to extend duty. 2. We need authorization to call up
							individual reservists.</p>
                        <p>This would give us something to get a vote on in the Congress. We could
							ask for special authority to increase aid to the Republic of Korea. I
							would ask Congress to validate authority to call up civilian aircraft if
							we are short on transport.</p>
                        <p>The President: <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark</persName>, how did your
							testimony go this morning? (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> was called to testify on his nomination to the
							Senate as Secretary of Defense.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: I think I got
							through the testimony all right this morning.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The request
							to extend tours and call people from the reserves is a good one. We
							could use this legislation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Would this
							legislation give authority or would it actually activate units?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It would give
							the President authority. I would request authority to call up about
							150,000 reservists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: A request
							for $100 million in aid does not serve the purpose at all.</p>
                        <p>The President: Now that all of you have said that, what I want to know is
							how we are going to get that ship out.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: What I
							recommend immediately is that we ask for authority to call up individual
							reservists, not units.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We also must face
							the situation of infiltration.</p>
                        <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0540"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We must be in a
							position to cope with any eventuality.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Remember that North
							Korea has a 1961 alliance with the Soviet Union and China.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Joint
							Chiefs want an extension of the terms of service. The Marines lose 1600
							trained men per month. Mr. President, you improve quicker the quality of
							our armed forces by extension of tours than by any other method. 2,500
							men a day leave the service.</p>
                        <p>The President: When we get all our men out there and all these planes out
							there and all these extensions, what do we do then?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Mr.
							President, we are not prepared to make a recommendation on that
							today.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I have reservations
							about the Tonkin Gulf resolution unless the other side forces our
							hand.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: As a layman,
							I would like to give you one reaction you may want to consider. I think
							we want to avoid taking steps which would make it look as if we are
							seizing on this incident to plug up all the loopholes that are existing
							in our current military posture. We do not want it to appear through any
							of our actions that we are using this to fill the gaps on our military
							program.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>:
								<persName>Arthur</persName>, the facts just will not support that
							view. If I do not need these men I will not ask for them. We do not have
							gaps on our forces we have to fill.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Won't they
							relate this to Vietnam (the extension of military tours).</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We could carry
							on with our rotation in Vietnam at the same time we do what is necessary
							in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I can assure
							you that we have no plans whatever to extend tours in Vietnam absent
							Korea. In fact, we think that one of the reasons why morale is so high
							in Vietnam is because of the limited tour of duty. We think it is a good
							system.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: Isn't there a
							shortage of U.S. officers in Korea?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: There is a
							world-wide shortage of Captains and Majors throughout the army.</p>
                        <p>(The President was interrupted by the telephone. He talked for several
							minutes with Senator Dirksen. After the conversation ended the President
							reported that he had told Senator Dirksen that we will take whatever
							diplomatic moves that are available, that we will meet whatever needs
							the military has, and then we will make decisions about our courses of
							action. I told him our principal interests were in getting the ship back
							and in getting the boys back. We must come up with a way to get that
							ship back.)</p>
                        <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0541"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Mr.
							President, the only way to get that ship out with the crew is talking
							through diplomatic channels. We must make it clear that this is the
							wiser course for North Korea. It is only through diplomatic channels
							that we will get them out. We must show them that this matter is
							sufficiently serious to release the ship and the crew.</p>
                        <p>I think we should take our steps fairly slowly. We should see how we are
							doing in the United Nations before we ask for broader authority in
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We cannot shoot the
							men out of there. The North Koreans do not have vessels on the high seas
							that we can seize.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: The only North
							Korean we have in our possession is the number two man in the North
							Korean news agency who defected. His point of view is that they will
							exploit the incident and then turn the ship loose for humanitarian
							reasons.</p>
                        <p>The President: That is about the same thing the Ambassador to Korea
							said.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: They do have
							territorial shipping. Assuming they have ships plying at coastal waters,
							couldn't we seize one of these?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: They have
							only four, and they are of very little importance.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Grabbing
							anything of theirs is permitted by law in limited retaliation of this
							act. However, sowing mines is an act of war. This would not be
							considered retaliatory.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: Military
							action alone does not get them back. Seizing a couple of ships does not
							get them back. I think they are more concerned about what we may do.
							This is more important than taking some limited action so that they know
							what our response is. You are worse off when they do not know what you
							might do.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We would like
							to move certain forces to the area. We need to pace ourselves. The
							Chiefs would like to move 26 B–52s, 15 to Okinawa and 11 to Guam.</p>
                        <p>The President: Go ahead and send the B–52s.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We should touch
							base with Sato before we do this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> called this an incident. What
							is important is the North Korean policy and what is behind that policy.
							We know this is new pressure against South Korea and ourselves. If we
							are to act we must be prepared for any action they may take.</p>
                        <p>The President: What else do you have in mind, Bob?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I would move
							other aircraft to the area.</p>
                        <p>The President: Why not move them out?</p>
                        <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0542"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I think for
							two reasons we should delay in moving the aircraft. It reduces our
							effectiveness of approach at the U.N. We are not contemplating any
							action right away.</p>
                        <p>Dick Helms: We do not see any signs of a major offensive action by the
							North Koreans into South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: I would like
							to address myself to the points raised by Bob McNamara. He is the man
							who will be responsible if our diplomatic efforts at the U.N. fail. I
							think to make military moves would not bother me. As the letter to Ayub
							Khan said, we do want to settle this matter by diplomatic means if
								possible.<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">See <ref target="#d228fn7">footnote 7, Document 228</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I see some positive signs that would be provided by the military action
							(of sending air units to South Korea).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Let's get
								<persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>'s permission first. We'll
							then move the B–52s.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Let's do not call
							it permission. It is notification.</p>
                        <p>The President: We must move up our forces to awaken the people to the
							danger. I would move our forces to the bases we already have. I would
							move them without saying much. I would be guided by the views of the
							military. Let's get our defenses in position.</p>
                        <p>The intercepts show North Korea is going into full mobilization. I would
							not send the B–52s out to bomb North Korea but I would put them into
							position. The Chiefs think they should be moved. We have got to have our
							hand out and our guard up.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I am inclined to
							agree with <persName>Arthur</persName> that the military moves will
							support our diplomatic efforts at the U.N. It will show the urgency and
							the seriousness of the matter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It is easy
							then. We will move the B–52s this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: I do not see why
							you have to announce these units squadron by squadron, and give our
							battle plan.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It will leak
							all over the place if we don't.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG2">George Christian</persName>: I always feel
							like we should give all the information we can on a matter like this.
							Our position looks rather weak when we fail to give the units and later
							it leaks out all over.</p>
                        <p>The President: <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark</persName>, what is your
							judgment on this whole situation?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: It has been my
							experience that when a situation of this type arises the public is first
							outraged. Later they change their mind.</p>
                        <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0543"/>
                        <p>If anything, I have a feeling that we need to proceed with caution. The
							situation about the ship is rather fuzzy in my mind. I have great
							concern about us getting out word of mobilization in this country.
							Suppose tomorrow that the North Koreans announce that they are
							mobilizing. Then we really build this situation up. Then, what if we do
							nothing? I am not comfortable with this large military build-up.</p>
                        <p>We may find that the matter will simmer down a lot during the U.N.
							discussion. I feel I should urge great caution in this matter and that
							we should proceed accordingly. If it appears we pose a threat to North
							Korea and do nothing, we are in a very difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: If North Korea goes
							crazy and launches an attack we couldn't do very much.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: I would agree
							with that. The South Korean airforce is very weak compared with North
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: But we must
							remember that we have the Enterprise and that it could retaliate with
							substantial force. There is a place where you get into a very critical
							position with this build-up.</p>
                        <p>The President: Then it becomes do we do something or nothing. What is
							your judgment, General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: I would like to
							proceed with positioning our force in South Korea as recommended. I
							would place 170 land-based aircraft in the area. I would proceed to
							station the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk off North Korea.</p>
                        <p>I would put her on the coast available to us. This would give us 300
							carrier aircraft and 150 land-based aircraft. This would give us ample
							aircraft to protect us against any eventuality.</p>
                        <p>The President: Why now?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We can move the
							aircraft quickly, but we have to have at least 18 hours to give the
							pilots a night's sleep and to provide some time to shake down on the
							bases. We must move maintenance units and spare parts. It would be four
							to five days before all of the units are operationally ready. The 26
							B–52s will give us heavy strike capability if preemptive strikes
							begin.</p>
                        <p>The President: General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>,
							how do you appraise our actions in light of what effect they will have
							on North Korea? What I am saying is, is it worth it to have your extra
							assurance when it may be viewed as a great provocation?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: First I do not
							think we can take the B–52s away from Vietnam. General Westmoreland
							faces a very serious situation. In recent cables he has asked for 120
							B–52 mission capability per month. We are doing that. We should reach
							that level by February 1.</p>
                        <p>It would be imprudent to draw down on Westmoreland's supply of B–52s. He
							is about to have the most vicious battle of the Vietnam war.</p>
                        <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0544"/>
                        <p>B–52s have an all-weather capability. If other aircraft area unable to
							fly, the B–52s become very vital in support of our ground forces.</p>
                        <p>To the larger question, all military schools teach us that military power
							is in existence to enhance our foreign policy capabilities and to
							preserve the internal security of the United States.</p>
                        <p>I think that more military moves would support our diplomatic efforts
							that are our first order of business. But we should be prepared to move
							on the other front if the need arises. Some would regard this as a
							provocation, I am sure. I know the Soviets would. I believe that it will
							prove to friend and enemy alike that there is determination on the part
							of the United States to do everything it can on both the diplomatic and
							the military front if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Public sentiment does change, but while we are moving on the diplomatic
							front we must be prepared to do something else if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We will alert
							our B–52s. We can get by with not announcing this. By alerting them
							tonight, we can reduce the lead time.</p>
                        <p>The President: Buzz, what you are saying is that you do not know what you
							will be called upon to do but you do know that if we take the B–52s away
							from Westmoreland that this would be inappropriate. You believe we
							should put in the others to be ready in the event of an attack.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: That is correct,
							sir. You will recall that in 1950 the North Koreans moved in artillery
							and moved across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. I would not
							discount the possibility of this happening again.</p>
                        <p>I would want the B–52s and the fighter bombers to back up the ground
							forces.</p>
                        <p>The President: What you would do is have them so they could pulverize the
							enemy before they got across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> if
							necessary.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: That is correct,
							sir. Also they are continuing their infiltration across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. The most symbolic act of the
							infiltrators was the attack on Blue House.</p>
                        <p>President Park said he would stand still for a reasonable time. But I
							think Park will retaliate if there is another Blue House incident or
							something of that type. I would like to have my units there in case they
							are needed. If diplomatic efforts fail there will be pressure to take
							retaliatory actions against North Koreans. We must be ready to react to
							what they might do. Although we don't like to imagine it, there could be
							a restart of the Korean War.</p>
                        <p>I asked the President to approve moving the units in the soonest possible
							time.</p>
                        <p>—We should place the Kitty Hawk in the Japan area in the next four
							days.</p>
                        <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0545"/>
                        <p>—I would deploy the 26 B–52s.</p>
                        <p>—I would issue instructions covertly for the movement of the 173
							aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: These
							military actions will create a sense of urgency for the U.N. to act. The
							only time those guys (the representatives to the United Nations) will do
							anything is when they have to.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: Buzz Wheeler makes
							a very logical case. But it disturbs me deeply. I think the President
							must proceed on the basis of probabilities and not possibilities. I
							think the North Koreans are not able to mount a massive military
							activity. They are engaged in harassments.</p>
                        <p>We should not send fleets of our aircraft to Korea. I think that is
							wrong. I think this heightens tension and builds it up.</p>
                        <p>If North Korea is planning something important that could then begin the
							provocation for us moving. I would get the planes and crews ready here
							at home. But our moral posture will be better if the North Koreans move
							first.</p>
                        <p>I am deeply sorry about the ship and the 83 men but I do not think it is
							worth a resumption of the Korean War.</p>
                        <p>The President: We know what we will do if we had these planes out there
							and if North Korea attacked. What do we do if we get the planes out
							there and North Korea does not attack? That is something we must
							consider.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (1 line of source text) not

                        <p>I want to get some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opinion as to why they
							believe they need the aircraft there now if we do not expect an
							attack.</p>
                        <p>Of course we should authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> to go to the U.N. and present our case.</p>

                        <p>The President: What recommendations do you have?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We are looking
							at four or five military possibilities:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The placement of mines in the Wonsan Harbor</hi>.
							This would require substantial air action to handle the situation
							properly and require neutralization of air fields in the area. We would
							have to destroy the Wonsan military facilities. It is probable that we
							would require naval aircraft for support.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Mine other North Korean ports</hi>. We would select
							two or three important ports. The same problems requiring the need for
							air support would be present.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Interdict coastal shipping</hi>. For this we also
							need heavy air cover.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Strike any one of a list of targets in North Korea
								by air or by air and naval gun fire</hi>. Hopefully we will have
							better photographs of North Korea after a reconnaissance mission
							tonight.</p>
                        <p>5. Replace <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> with another ship protected by
							ample air and naval cover.</p>
                        <p>Anything else would require substantial military action.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion has been made that we seize North Korean ships. But they
							have no large ocean going craft. And we do not know where the four small
							vessels they have are located.</p>
                        <p>The President: What are we going to do with the aircraft that we plan to
							send to South Korea. Will they be there for purely defense purposes in
							case of further incidents?</p>
                        <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: They would be
							there in the event that a decision was made to take reprisal action
							against North Korea in addition to their defensive value.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: If the North
							Koreans were to release the ship and or the crew in ten to twelve days
							the only thing we would have suffered would be humiliation. If we decide
							to replace the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> with the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi>, we will need air support to protect
							it.</p>
                        <p>If we do not get the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> back the President
							would want full air power there to take care of any massive response. In
							my judgment, mining would be the smallest increment of military
							action.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: We
							could keep their shipping and their patrol boats in the Wonsan
							Harbor.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: To do that we
							must have air cover and naval craft.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: The
							North Koreans have made gains right away. I believe they regard this
							action as a low risk effort. They have shown that they can do this. They
							may underestimate our difficulties elsewhere or place a high value on
							causing us more difficulties in this area. There is some indication this
							may be what they want to do. They are seeking to make life much more
							difficult for us.</p>
                        <p>There is no evidence (<persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Richard
								Helms</persName> also confirmed this) that the North Koreans want to
							start another war.</p>
                        <p>They may be willing to return the crew and the ship. They may get
							something from the equipment aboard the ship.</p>
                        <p>But this still leaves us with the fact that they took a tug at Uncle
							Sam's beard and got away with it. I would put a high probability factor
							on their returning this ship.</p>
                        <p>The President: Well, what do we do now?</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I
							would prefer to see the screw turned on North Korea.</p>
                        <p>In gradual steps we would move aircraft to South Korea. It makes good
							sense to move in the fighter bombers for the reasons Buzz (General
								<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>) has given, and also
							to show the North Koreans and the United Nations the seriousness of the
							situation.</p>
                        <p>I would send in a squadron of aircraft tomorrow. Then send in other
							planes on Saturday and more on Sunday. I do have a question about the
							B–52's. If you send the B–52's to the area without any public knowledge
							there is not much punch that this gives to the diplomatic effort. If we
							send the B–52's to the area with public knowledge that this is connected
							to Korea it may be too big. This may be too much. But you do increase
							the potential of the United Nations doing something by sending in the
							fighter bombers.</p>
                        <p>The President: What is the practical effect of this?</p>
                        <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0548"/>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I
							think that will get rid of the issue quicker. By moving the aircraft in
							gradually you will get more out of it than by doing it all at one time
							or by not doing it at all.</p>
                        <p>The President: The incident, <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure, may
							be more than a pinprick. In my judgment this must be coordinated with
							what is happening in South Vietnam. (Stepped up attacks on U.S. units in
							Vietnam along with major North Vietnamese and Viet Cong build ups.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I agree with
							that, although I have no real evidence of the connection.</p>
                        <p>I view this situation very seriously. The great danger that we must avoid
							is that the Soviets and the North Vietnamese will interpret something
							that we do as a sign of weakness. If we show weakness and are not firm,
							I think it will prolong the Vietnam war substantially.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: I would like to
							view this matter differently. Let us assume for the moment that our only
							goal is to get the men and the ship back.</p>
                        <p>What would be the best way to achieve that end?</p>
                        <p>If we get the ship and the men back without taking substantial military
							action the President will get credit for restraint.</p>
                        <p>We may have gotten a hair pulled from our beard. I would be ready to
							sacrifice that hair because our options are limited at this time.</p>
                        <p>We must be ready for the next try. We have very few alternatives at this
							point. So, again I ask what are the best ways to get the ship and the
							men back.</p>
                        <p>The President: I see little hope that the United Nations will yield
							anything productive. We do need to show that this is a very serious
							matter. We must show to the North Koreans and their brothers that they
							must avoid the confrontation. We need to show our plan in the United
							Nations and display some muscle to back up that plan.</p>
                        <p>Tommy Thompson (Ambassador to Moscow) said the Communist never react well
							to a show of force. That was not the lesson learned in the Middle East
							and in the Cuban Missile Crisis. We must not let them misjudge our
							strength so that they will be encouraged to do this type of thing again.
							Personally I would like to find some of their ships and do the same
							thing to them which they have done to us.</p>
                        <p>What about some other alternatives that we have not discussed such as the
							South Koreans taking offensive action across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. The North Koreans have been doing a lot of
							infiltrating and harassment, so why not reciprocate?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> are eager to go into North Korea on hit
							and run raids like those taken into South Korea by the North Koreans. We
							have exercised great restraint on the South Koreans to the <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0549"/>point where the South Koreans will no
							longer tell our American General the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							plans.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: Mr.
							President, we discussed the fact that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							threw overboard classified equipment. Another alternative is for us to
							send a destroyer into the area where the gear was thrown overboard. The
							destroyer would have divers aboard to bring the gear up. This is
							completely legal and it is possible that the North Koreans would take
							action against this vessel. If they did we would be in a good position
							in the eyes of world opinion to retaliate.</p>
                        <p>We do not know if they are trying to recover that gear themselves.</p>
                        <p>The President: I thought we had an intercept that showed that they are
							trying to recover the material with divers. Isn't that true <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: That is correct. We
							had an intercept today which indicated they are diving in the area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: There will be an
							ox cart mission tonight which should give us some additional information
							about that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: Our alternatives are
							basically two:</p>
                        <p>1. Actions to get the ship back.</p>
                        <p>2. Actions to strike back in retaliation for this ship seizure.</p>
                        <p>We should search all photographs and look for their ships. Personally I
							would not be opposed to seizing a Korean ship flying a Polish flag. We
							should strain for ways to find their ships and determine operational
							methods to place mines without knocking out their airfields and other
							facilities used for defense. Of course we must be fully prepared for
							what counter actions the North Koreans might be prepared to take.</p>
                        <p>The President: Would you address yourself to the question presented by
								<persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: What will
							produce the ship.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: A conviction by the
							North Koreans that they will run into more trouble than it is worth.
							That will produce the ship.</p>
                        <p>They think we are strained and tied down in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Therefore a measured show of force is appropriate. I feel we should put
							in additional air power for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>A. We need increased air power in the Republic of Korea anyway. This
							incident dramatizes the deficiency of the aircraft in South Korea. It
							was surprising that we only had four planes there and that they were
							“out to lunch.”</p>
                        <p>B. If this effort fails and we undertake to disgorge the ship, we still
							need heavy air cover.</p>
                        <p>The President: The only thing you know is to put more aircraft there. Is
							that the answer to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark</persName>'s
							question? <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> says this will
							make them more entrenched.</p>
                        <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0550"/>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: What I
							believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> had
							in mind was that we should not say “hand over or else.” They are tough
							little bastards. I do not think Tommy had in mind a series of steps to
							make North Korea know that we are about to do something and that we mean
							business.</p>
                        <p>I think a measured show of force supports our diplomatic efforts. You can
							tell publicly—I do not think it has been mentioned before—that we are
							giving South Korea two destroyers. You can move in the B–52's. In my
							judgment all of these actions support our diplomatic efforts.</p>
                        <p>We can start by saying that no North Korean shipping will come out of two
							or three harbors. By blocking them off, we take reversible steps. In
							other words these are steps that do not require that we take additional
							steps.</p>
                        <p>We should not let the North Koreans think that the Security Council is
							the way we have planned to deal with this. They must know we are
							prepared to take further actions, military ones if necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President: You and Bob McNamara work out a schedule of movements for
							the aircraft to South Korea. What do you say in answer to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>'s question. What do we do
							if this is our whole objective.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We must
							protect ourselves from permitting the North Koreans and the North
							Vietnamese and the Soviets getting the belief that we are weak. I would
							go back to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>. I think the
							Soviets knew of this or if they did not they have enough influence to
							shape the conduct of North Korea. I would not deal in a belligerent,
							public way, but I would show them that it is essential to give up the
							ship and the men.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: What is wrong in
							telling the North Koreans they must get the ship to us by a certain date
							or face the consequences.</p>
                        <p>The President: The simple answer to that is that we do not want a war
							with the Chinese and the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: Here is a
							proposed schedule for movement of tactical air. We are talking about an
							order of 8 days using forces in West Pac. In the first three days you
							would have 28 F–104's, 14 reconnaissance aircraft and 28 F–105's.</p>
                        <p>Two days later you would have the bulk of the U.S. strike force. This
							would be 28 F–105's, 18 F–100's and 17 F4D's.</p>
                        <p>After seven days you will have initial combat readiness.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: When
							will this become public knowledge?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: As soon as the
							units begin to move out. These things are very easily discernible from
							the movement of men and equipment.</p>
                        <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0551"/>
                        <p>The President: I do not see what is wrong with sending out the 28
							fighters and the 14 reconnaissance planes now.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I
							think that is fine.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: What you want
							is a series of movements. I do not think we need to make a decision
							tonight on this. I would recommend mid-day tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>The President: I do want to space this out (the movement of aircraft into
							South Korea) but I want President Park to know that we are going to do
							this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We can do

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: Mr. President, in
							a discussion we had yesterday at the Department of State I presented a
							view. Since you were not there I would like to give it here.</p>
                        <p>I do not think our case with reference to the ship is a strong one. The
							North Koreans have a better case on where the ship was. They were there.
							We weren't.</p>
                        <p>This was a “spy ship”. There is a general feeling in the world that if
							you catch a spy you do him in. The North Koreans can say that we invaded
							their waters. We do not have a clear case to support. We must not issue
							an ultimatum. The odds are they would tell us to go sell our papers.
							Like blackmail, it is no good if you publicize it. It will become public
							knowledge we are sending in planes. The North Koreans have indicated
							something more may be coming. We do want to be prepared and ready for
							that. I recommend that we approach the Soviets again. I recommend that
							we go to the United Nations. I suggest that we start a quiet build up.
							We should send another message to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The North Koreans may conclude they have gotten as much out of this
							incident as they can. Frankly I can stand a minor set back to our
							position rather than to take action which may lead us into another war.
							The capture of a spy ship is not worth us going to war.</p>
                        <p>The President: Okay, let's get a spaced-out movement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I will get
							the orders prepared tonight. We can issue them tomorrow at mid-day.</p>
                        <p>The President: I ask all present to assemble again at 11:00 a.m. on
								Friday.<note n="2" xml:id="d226fn2">January 26.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I delivered to <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>
							President's message to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at
							12:45 today. After reading message, <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> asked me if I had anything to say orally. I
							replied I had nothing to add to what I had said in my conversations with
							Kuznetsov, about which I assumed <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> was informed.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said he would, of
							course, transmit message to addressee, and Soviet leadership and
							government would be informed of its contents. By way of preliminary
							comment, however, he said he hoped US Government would take sober
							position in this matter and not succumb to momentary sentiments which,
							as also indicated in President's message, now evident in US. Situation,
							facts as well as consequences, should be weighed very carefully. He said
							that for obvious reasons he did not wish to discuss at this time
							possible Soviet answer to message.</p>
                        <p>3. Stressing that he was now speaking outside context his preliminary
							remarks, <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> expressed deep
							regret US vessels took such liberties. Asserted US military command
							apparently sees nothing wrong in US vessels coming close to shores,
							cities, and installations of other countries. US military command seems
							to be in habit of disregarding interests other states. For example,
							Soviets had sent numerous notes to US containing specific data about
							location, time, and identification numbers US aircraft which had buzzed
							Soviet ships but in each case US gave standard reply that Soviet
							information not in accordance with facts. This reduced
							government-to-government communications to level where they could not be
							regarded as serious.</p>
                        <p>4. Repeating I had little to add to what I had told Kuznetsov, I pointed
							out US concerned about pattern of incidents along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> in Korea, with latest such incident
							having been infiltration 31 North Ko rean <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0553"/>agents into South Korea. Coming on top of this, <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident could not but add to seriousness
							with which we viewed situation.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> asserted other side had
							information and facts re infiltration of agents in Korea which were of
							entirely opposite nature, but he did not wish dwell on this. He
							concluded by stating President's message would be studied and reply
							conveyed to us in due course.</p>
                        <p>6. In response my question when <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> due back from India, <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> would be in India another two or three days and
							might stop for day or two in Afghanistan on his way back.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It is
							possible, but the chances are less than 50–50.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The ship has the
							best navigational gear we have. North Korea has a rugged coastline.
							Because of this we can get a good fix by radar. <persName corresp="#p_MATJ1">Admiral Moorer</persName> has said that it is
							very improbable that the vessel was even a mile from where it ought to
							be.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the intercepts of North Korean radio traffic confirm that
							the North Korean ships which intercepted the Pueblo were in the same
							area the Pueblo reported as its location.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The only
							thing which would have brought the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> inside
							of the territorial waters was the possibility that they were getting a
							very good intercept and needed to move closer to get a better
							product.</p>
                        <p>The President: Do you have anything more to report on the men and the
							equipment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We have
							nothing more on this.</p>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: There is nothing
							either way.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: There was a
							North Korean press message which said that the crew should be tried and
							punished as criminals.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: We
							interpret this as their response to our calling up reserves.</p>
                        <p>The President: Do we harass Soviet ships?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes, they
							harass us too. This is almost a way of life on the high seas.</p>
                        <p>The President: Let's be more careful about all of this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We will
							reassess the whole thing.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I
							thought there was a case of our buzzing a ship in Haiphong Harbor.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: That was a
							photo reconnaissance mission to see if the ship was damaged as
							alleged.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: I have no
							objection.</p>
                        <p>The President: What do we say now to the Congress?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Mr. President
							you have before you a list of authority which we would like to require
							from the Congress in relation to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							incident. These are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Authorize the extension of all enlistments, appointments, periods of
							active duty, and other periods of obligated service of Regular and
							Reserve members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force.</p>
                        <p>Reason required—Extension of tours of duty involuntarily is the quickest
							way to achieve any needed expansion of force strength. Such <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0558"/>extension will add 2200 trained
							personnel per day. This can be authorized by Joint Resolution.</p>
                        <p>2. Authorize the call of all individual Reservists.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Reason required</hi>—Department of Defense
							Appropriation Act, 1967,<note n="12" xml:id="d228fn12"> PL 89–687,
								October 15, 1966, 80 Stat. 980–998; the Appropriation Act of 1968
								actually covered the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, however. See
								PL 90–96, September 29, 1967, 81 Stat. 231–249.</note> authorizes
							the President to order units of the ready Reserve of an armed force to
							active duty. Authority to call individuals from units is required in
							order to fill gaps in units on active duty with personnel possessing
							special skills. Moreover, extension of tours of those presently on
							active duty would be inequitable unless individual Reservists are
							subject to call. This, too, can be accomplished by Joint Resolution.</p>
                        <p>3. Expand South Korean military assistance program by $100,000,000.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Reason required</hi>—The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> request for Fiscal Year 1968 was cut 40%. This made it
							impossible to expand the military assistance given to South Korea,
							although such expansion is warranted in view of their troop contribution
							in South Vietnam and the increased level of harassment by North Korean
							forces. A supplemental appropriation under the Foreign Assistance Act
							will permit the funding of destroyers, helicopters and artillery and
							facilities needed for counter-infiltration purposes, and the necessary
							modernization to increase the defense capabilities of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> aircraft, vehicles, anti-aircraft
							equipment and patrol craft. In addition, it will fund the required
							increase in ammunition levels.</p>
                        <p>The President: How many times have we authorized the extension of
							enlistments and periods of active duty?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Many
							times.</p>
                        <p>The President: Get me the number of times we have done it and the reasons
							for each.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We will do
							that.</p>
                        <p>The President: We can only call units now?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: This is
							correct. We can only call units. This request would permit the authority
							to call individuals from units in order to fill any gaps in units on
							active duty with personnel possessing special skills.</p>
                        <p>The President: How many men does this affect?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Roughly
							150,000.</p>
                        <p>The President: How much was cut from the military assistance program?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The Fiscal
							Year 1968 request was cut 40%.</p>

                        <p>The President: Nick (Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>) how do we get an expression from the
							Congress on what our policy should be in regard to Korea?
								<persName>George</persName> (<persName corresp="#p_CG2">George
								Christian</persName>) we must make certain that in the future we
							notify the Congress before the press announcement is made. There are a
							few people who are mad because they were not advised of the call up
							action yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Mendel Rivers
							is mad.</p>
                        <p>The President: Mansfield is also bellyaching about it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I called
							Mansfield.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: If you
							go all the way down the road you need nothing short of a Tonkin
							Resolution.</p>
                        <p>The President: The Tonkin Resolution wasn't very effective. Fulbright is
							against a resolution of any kind. We should discretely show the Congress
							copies of the mutual security acts between North Korea and the Soviets.
							I thought we should have had a resolution on the Israel situation. We
							have a new ball game with the Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
                        <p>Let's do what we can to bring them along a little bit.</p>
                        <p>Let's give some thought to how we can get Congress in on it.</p>
                        <p>We need more than a toast—that is all we have on the Israel situation. If
							they (the Congress) murder us on Vietnam with all those facts including
							SEATO and the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, what are we going to do in a
							situation like this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I agree. We
							need strong Congressional support.</p>
                        <p>The President: I have always tried to put Congress in on the take-off as
							well as on the landing. If the Dominican Republic means nothing, if the
							Tonkin Gulf means nothing, what do we do here. We do not want to
							exercise power and authority without the support and approval of the
							Congress.</p>
                        <p>Let's discuss with Senator Fulbright and Senator Russell what ways we
							should approach this matter.</p>
                        <p>At some point we are going to be called upon to put up or shut up. I want
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to set up a
							meeting with Senator Russell and take Buzz (General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>) along with you. Nick (Under
							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>) you do the
							same with Senator Fulbright and Senator Mansfield. Also I want you
							(General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>) to get General

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>: The key here is

                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: We will set up a
							special task force on this.</p>
                        <p>The President: Get your very best people working on this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Mr.
							President, we should remind you of something we pointed out before the
							President entered. It would not be appropriate to take any military
							action in less than seven days because of the need to get our units
							there and get them combat effective.</p>
                        <p>The President: We also should keep in close touch with the Korean
							Embassy. Park may be about to blow something and we would be
							involved.</p>
                        <p>The President: What about a television address to the Nation?<note n="14" xml:id="d228fn14">See <ref target="#d223fn6">footnote 6, Document

                            <persName corresp="#p_CG2">George Christian</persName>: The point of
							concern is that the President has said nothing publicly on this matter,
							although I would not recommend any television now, I would think the
							President might want to consider dropping something into a speech.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: We
							must remember that <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is

                        <p>The President: I want you to give <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
							an outline of what to say in their speeches. All of you remember that we
							brought those Russian ships in a while back. They paid $60 fine and were

                        </p>
                        <p>The President: This is simple. We cannot provide an Armada over every
							ship we have. The Russians do not have their ships protected.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG2">George Christian</persName>: Another question
							they are raising is why there was not more air power in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We do not
							have planes assigned to protect these types of ships. This is an
							advantage that the initiator had. They also had MIGs overhead.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We could pick up
							six trawlers off our shores today if we wish. They don't protect their

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: If these ships

								thus far refrained from direct involvement in the Korean situation.
								The analysis concluded that, although both nations would be alarmed
								by direct U.S. military activity against North Korea, neither would
								retaliate directly unless their territorial security were seriously
								threatened or breached. The paper cautioned, however, that U.S.

								statements declaring the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in

                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin text</hi>. Dear Mr. President: I have received
							the text of your message which was handed by Ambassador L. Thompson to
							our Minister of Foreign Affairs on January 26, 1968, concerning the
							incident involving the American naval intelligence vessel <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> near the shores of the Korean People's
							Democratic Republic.</p>
                        <p>3. Allow me to say with the utmost directness that we cannot share the
							interpretation of events which is presented by the American side.
							Information available to us attests to the fact that the American naval
							intelligence vessel <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was detained by Korean
							authorities not in international waters but in the territorial waters of
							the KPDR while carrying out certain intelligence operations. This is the
							main thing, it is here where the entire essence of the affair lies, and
							therefore the responsibility for the incident falls entirely on the
							American military command, which acted contrary to the generally
							accepted norms of international law protecting the inviolability of the
							territories of states and their territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>4. But since this is so, it is the US which must take steps to find ways
							of settling the incident and, in any event, not do anything that could
							add fuel to the fire. You yourself expressed in your message the
							conviction that the interests of preserving universal peace would not be
							served by increased tension in that area.</p>
                        <p>5. However, how can this be reconciled with the fact that during the past
							few days in the US the situation is being heated up, irresponsible
							voices calling for a “return strike” against the KPDR and calls for the
							use of arms and force are being heard? Those who make such statements
							are apparently little concerned about what all this can lead to.</p>
                        <p>6. How the American military look at the principles of international law,
							and in particular the principle of the freedom of navigation, is well
							known, if only by the fact that US military aircraft are buzzing <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0566"/>systematically Soviet and other
							vessels on the high seas. We have repeatedly drawn the attention of the
							US Government to the fact that this is fraught with the possibility of
							military incidents, but the buzzing operations have continued to this
							day. Recently even more serious cases have taken place where American
							aircraft subjected Soviet merchant vessels to bombing and strafing. And,
							incidentally, a very calm attitude, to put it mildly was then
							demonstrated in the US with respect to these facts, although they
							involved human losses and major material damage.</p>
                        <p>7. But now, when an American naval vessel has been detained because it
							penetrated foreign territorial waters, a noisy campaign is being
							developed in the US, which, judging by everything, has the support of
							the American Government. Otherwise, how can one understand the report
							that a Seventh Fleet detachment consisting of the nuclear carrier
							Enterprise, destroyers and other vessels has been ordered to move in the
							direction of the KPDR?</p>
                        <p>8. The Soviet Government believes that in connection with the incident
							which has arisen near the KPDR coast, it is most important to analyze
							the situation soberly and not to succumb to emotions which can lead one
							to where perhaps he does not even intend to go.</p>
                        <p>9. You, Mr. President, have expressed a desire that the Soviet Government
							respond to your anxiety in connection with this incident. In our view,
							the shortest and the most reliable way for settling it is not to allow
							precipitous actions, and this would create a more favorable
							atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>10. We are convinced that the promptest possible settlement of the
							situation would be in the interest of all sides. Such settlement must be
							based, of course on complete respect for the sovereignty and
							independence of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. Any attempts to
							apply methods of pressure with respect to the KPDR can only complicate
							the possibilities for a settlement.</p>
                        <p>11. We have informed the Government of the Korean People's Democratic
							Republic of your message.</p>
                        <p>12. Respectfully, A. Kosygin. January 27, 1968. End text.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I think we can take some encouragement from fact that despite
							Kuznetsov's first statement to me that Soviets would not act as
							intermediary, Soviets in fact have transmitted two messages to
							Pyongyang. I am also struck by <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s statement that Soviets believe quick
							settlement of incident is in the interest of all sides.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> gave every appearance
							of being convinced that incident took place in territorial waters. If we
							could tell Soviets that we are prepared to make available to them copy
							of tape recording of report of Korean subchaser reporting its position
							this could dispose of that part of the argument, although I doubt
							Soviets would accept such offer and would say such tapes could easily be
							faked.</p>
                        <p>3. While possibilitiy exists that Soviets were party to this affair, my
							judgment, based on their handling of the problem up to now and the
							general situation, is that they were not. They are clearly concerned
							over the way the matter is blowing up which tends to limit their freedom
							of action. Their distrust of our military is certainly genuine.</p>
                        <p>4. Anything we can do to convince them that our purpose is simply to
							settle the incident and get our men and ship back would be helpful. For
							example, if we could find a way to let them know, perhaps in any reply
							President may make to Kosygin, that we have taken steps to calm down
							South Koreans, this would be useful. It would also increase Soviets
							possibility to pressure North Koreans if we could put Enterprise out of
							the area or at least from the vicinity of Wonsan. I think we must take
								<persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>'s warning to me
							seriously.</p>

                        <p>Between 2000 and 2100 hours January 27 the Communist members of <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> met with MG Pak Chung-kuk, senior
							member KPA/CP/side of Military Armistice Commission. Pak requested them
							to transmit following official and unofficial messages from him to
							senior member <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss>. The messages,
							in Korean, were translated into English by KPA, then taken by Polish and
							Czech <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members to Swiss and Swedish
							members. Official message follows:</p>
                        <p>“Govt of North Korea thinks that solving question of ship and crew is
							impossible when made by threatening or using force. If the United States
							will try to use force to free the ship, KPA will answer with the same
							means and it is risk that instead of freeing the crew they would get
							only bodies. It is quite possible to solve this problem if USA will
							acknowledge that the people of the ship are prisoners of war and if US
							will show willingness to negotiate or discuss in a normal way when one
							side would like to have prisoners back.”<note n="4" xml:id="d232fn4">When drafting a reply to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s message, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> received and forwarded a copy of this cable
								to the President. With reference to Pak's comments suggesting the
								crew be returned as prisoners of war, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> commented that that approach could be “the
								quickest track,” but would require pacification of the South Koreans
								by keeping some of the recently transferred aircraft in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and by increasing U.S. funding of
								anti-infiltration measures to improve <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security. He further advised the President: “Sir:
								This is the break. The problem is how to do it with maximum
								dignity.” (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to the President, January 27; Johnson
								Library, National Security File, Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident, Vol. Ia, Part A [through
								January])</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The following unofficial message was given to Pole and Czech obviously
							for transmission also:</p>
                        <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>“Now the Captain recognizes his criminal acts …<note n="5" xml:id="d232fn5">Reference is to Bucher's alleged confession
								broadcast by Radio Pyongyang on January 25.</note> The crew are in
							very good condition. Although they acted as enemies in our coastal
							waters and committed a crime, those who are wounded are under normal
							medical care. The body of one killed is preserved. Further details about
							the situation of the crew members could be obtained through direct
							contact between both sides.”</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Comment by Swiss member:</hi> This is interesting in
							that only two days ago Pak told his <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members “Even if not in territorial waters the ship
							was acting against us.”</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Most unusual feature of foregoing is
							that Pak chose to use <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> as channel.
							We can only surmise that Communist members <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> had earlier passed request for info on crew members to
							him, despite statement to contrary to Swiss and Swede (Ref A).
							Experience with Pak at <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> indicates he
							would not have taken this action without instructions from
							Pyongyang.</p>

							Member:</p>
                        <p>“1. I have received the message which you (Major General <persName corresp="#p_PCK1">Pak Chung-kuk</persName>, Senior North Korean
							Member of Military Armistice Commission) sent me through the channels of
							the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.</p>
                        <p>2. My reply is as follows: The policy of the United States Government
							with respect to the S.S. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew was
							publicly stated when the President of the United States on January 26
							said, 'We shall <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0570"/>continue to use
							every means available to find a prompt and peaceful solution to the

                        </p>
                        <p>3. The crew of the S.S. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> are United States
							Naval personnel, acting under orders of the United States Navy. Two of
							them are civilian scientists, specialists in hydrographic work. You have
							captured these men by force of arms. At the very least, they are
							entitled to the protection of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, to which
							you subscribe.</p>
                        <p>4. I am relieved to receive information through unofficial channels that
							they are good condition, the wounded are receiving normal medical care,
							and that the body of the one who died is preserved.</p>
                        <p>5. It has been suggested that further details could be obtained through
							direct contact between both sides. I therefore request that the names of
							the injured and dead be provided us through the Joint Duty Officer, and
							I request an immediate meeting of the Senior Members of both sides to
							discuss and resolve this matter promptly. We are agreeable to either a
							private or open meeting.”</p>

                                <ref target="#d233">Document 233</ref>.</note> Further instructions
							follow:</p>
                        <p>1. In meetings with North Korean side of <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> you should make business-like, dispassionate
							presentation of US positions. In answer to any North Korean harangue or
							propagandistic argumentation, you should give calm and factual response,
							setting forth US views plainly and firmly.</p>
                        <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0571"/>
                        <p>2. North Korean side may press argument that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in territorial waters. You should respond with
							following points:</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> under US Naval orders to stay at least
							13 nautical miles from coast and thus would not enter any waters that
							North Korea claimed as territorial sea;</p>
                        <p>b. At time when <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was hailed by North Korean
							submarine chaser, <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> radioed her position as
							39–25.2 North Latitude 127–55 East Longitude—a position more than 15
							nautical miles from nearest North Korean territory, Ung Do Island;</p>
                        <p>c. At exactly the same time, North Korean submarine chaser Number 35
							radioed to shore its position as 39 degrees 25 minutes North Latitude
							127 degrees 56 minutes East Longitude—a position approximately one mile
							further East and seaward from that reported by <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>;</p>
                        <p>d. At time of boarding, North Korean vessels reported the position as
							further East, at 39–26 North Latitude 128–02 East Longitude.</p>
                        <p>3. North Korean official message said, “It is quite possible to solve
							this problem if USA will acknowledge that the people of the ship are
							prisoners of war.” We are not sure what they mean. This may be intended
							as an admission that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew was engaged
							in warlike activity. Or it may be intended as a ploy to bargain for the
							return of North Koreans. Accordingly our language avoids specific
							reference to prisoners of war, and you should avoid phrase or
							acknowledgment, and try to minimize issue, simply repeating that they
							were taken by force and are at least entitled to the protection of
							Geneva Conventions of 1949. If this point proves troublesome, you should
							say these are highly technical and legal matters, and you would like
							clarification of what they mean, so as to study matter further.</p>
                        <p>4. North Korean official message refers initially to “question of ship
							and crew” but later to “willingness to negotiate or discuss in a normal
							way when one side would like to have prisoners back.” US position, of
							course, is that both vessel and crew are to be returned and you should
							seek to deal with both together. However, there is obviously a priority
							in physical return of crew from North Korean custody and, realistically
							considered, arrangements for return of crew could be more rapidly
							carried out than necessarily more complicated arrangements for return of
							vessel.</p>
                        <p>5. If North Korean side should refer to prospect of criminal trial or
							penalties for crew members, you should point out that no basis exists
							for prosecution and that any such action would be contrary to Geneva
							Conventions of 1949 and threats this nature not helpful in search for
							peaceful solution.</p>

                        <p>The attached cable from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> indicates clearly his problem with our proposed

							the South Koreans on the infiltration problem. By leaving some of the

                        <p>Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> will have been informed and

                        <p>We will shortly send up to you State's proposed reply to <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> which suggests: 1) go
							immediately to Park without an interim message to the North Koreans; 2)
							tell him our strategy is to take these issues one at a time; 3) indicate
							specifically our willingness for later meetings on the question of
							infiltration and increased military aid.</p>

							and (B) would have on US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations.
							As we have reported, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s from President
							on down are convinced that our actions and statements since <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident simply do not recognize extreme
							gravity of threat to internal security and political position of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> represented by Blue House raid and
							North Korean determination to increase subversive effort.</p>
                        <p>2. We have not informed <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> of exchange
							between ourselves and North Korea through <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members. Despite security precautions we cannot keep
							this from them for very long. We have already received anguished
							approach from Foreign Ministry voicing suspicion that we are attempting
							to contact <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> directly at other
							locations, notably Warsaw, and that we therefore intend to confine
							negotiations to retrieval of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew. We
							have ample evidence that suspicions are also growing at highest levels
							that once we succeed in obtaining release of ship and crew, we will
							withdraw force augmentations and leave <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> problem in status quo ante <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> with no improvement in President Park's political or
							security problems. We have had broad hints that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s are talking among themselves of possible withdrawal
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces from operational
							control CINCUNC and, because of concern over reopening of hostilities
							here, return of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops from Vietnam.
							We do not believe they are serious, but fact that senior <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s imply such consideration is indicative
							of psychological climate we must deal with here. Should <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s learn that we have requested meeting
							of senior members <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> solely to discuss
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident, as suggested <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0574"/>Refs (A) and (B), without parallel
							effort on intrusion problem, results could be explosive.</p>
                        <p>3. Moreover, whatever subject matter, believe it would be highly
							inadvisable to express willingness to hold open <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting. Presence of press and other witnesses at open
							meeting would impel Pak to put on propaganda show and attempt to place
							US in most humiliating light possible.</p>

							contained Ref (A) plus para 5 ending after words “joint duty officers.”
							Such reply is currently being translated and prepositioned for immediate
							delivery by secure means. By limiting this reply to request for
							information on condition of crew members, we would also provide <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> opportunity to follow through with
							letter they suggested to us yesterday (Seoul 3697).<note n="8" xml:id="d235fn8">In telegram 3697 from Seoul, January 27, the

							to discuss problem of obtaining release of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							and crew and to impress on North Koreans in most forceful terms gravity
							of situation posed by continuing North Korean infiltration. If President
							insists that <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> senior member
							demand guarantee from North Korea that there will be no further
							intrusion, Ambassador will respond that it probably impossible to
							obtain. However, to ease President's very real concerns, request
							Ambassador be authorized if necessary to inform him that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will do following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Retain substantial proportion of force augmentation in and near Korea
							until such time as developments indicate infiltration threat and its
							attendant political and psychological problems materially lessened.</p>
                        <p>(2) To provide tangible evidence that we are doing something directly for
							the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will airlift available <gloss target="#t_CIGCOREP1">CIGCOREP</gloss> items as requested in Ref (D), which <gloss target="#t_USFK1">USFK</gloss> is passing separately directly to
							Dept.</p>
                        <p>(3) Acknowledge firm commitment on spring delivery first destroyer, which
							heretofor has been tied to additional dispatch of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops to Vietnam. <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0575"/>We are under no illusions that these
							items, if agreed, would entirely eliminate pressures on US arising from
							Park's internal political position. They may ease pressures for time
							being, however, if carefully publicized.</p>
                        <p>(C) Senior member <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> will then
							send separate message to senior member KPA/CPV side requesting private
							senior member to senior member <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>
							meeting. Request update guidance contained Ref (B).</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador will raise problem of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							attendance at UNSC (Ref C) at time he makes approach mentioned para 4(B)

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: [The recording of this
							conversation begins at this point.] which I think ought to be at night
							and not during the middle of the day, 'cause I think, you know, people
							look at it. Advance a proposition of this type, you say that—you have
							said to the American people that you want this settled by diplomatic
							means, if possible. You have also said that the ship and crew must be
							returned, and you adhere to that statement. Now, you are prepared, if
							the ship and crew are returned promptly, to then submit the—you would
							say, that we are satisfied on the basis of incontrovertible evidence,
							which has been now made public, that this ship was in international
							waters. Nevertheless, you are prepared to submit the entire matter,
							after the ship and crew are returned, to the International Court of
							Justice and abide by the results. If our case is not what we said it
							was, we would make appropriate reparations to them. If our case was as
							we said it was, they should make appropriate reparations to us. It would
							seem to me that such a statement from you—they'll turn it down, Mr.
							President. Although in one instance—I've been researching the precedents
							over the weekend—there was a situation in the Corfu Channel case where
							Britain and Albania got into a problem about intrusion upon
							international waters and where the Albanians mined the Corfu Channel.
								<pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>And they agreed at that
							time it should go to the Court—the British ship was damaged—and the
							Court ordered the Albanians to pay damages. Now, there is great
							virtue—you know, our public and the world opinion believes very much in
							the judicial process. All fair-minded people think, “Submit matters to
							courts and courts decide it.” A proposition like that put by you in a
							solemn declaration to the American people and to world opinion would, I
							think, have a tremendous impact. Anybody who would then say that you
							were not acting with restraint, etc., could not say it. This is a far
							better proposal than [Senator] Mike Mansfield's silly proposal that even
							though the ship was in international waterways we ought to lie to get
							our men back. That's just asinine. [The President can be heard chuckling
							in the background.] But for you to put a proposal saying that “You
							return our men and the ship; however we will undertake—we will put the
							case to the International Court. We're prepared to do it promptly upon
							the return, and we will abide the results of that decision.” Now there's
							a Russian on the Court, so they can't say the Court's stacked against
							'em—and a Pole. But on the whole, the Court is pretty—not badly
							disposed.</p>
                        <p>President: How many on the Court?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Let me see—</p>
                        <p>President: Give me a number.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Fourteen, I think. I
							haven't got the exact number, but I could easily get it for you. It
							isn't bad from our standpoint. It's got Latin Americans, it's got the
							Australians, it's got British judges, its got—we've got a good judge in
							Phil Jessup. I don't think we would do badly. And our evidence, the one
							we have been developing, is good evidence.</p>
                        <p>President: Where does this Court sit, in Geneva?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: In The Hague. And we
							would have to invoke the Court. They sit whenever their jurisdiction is
							invoked. And we would, you could say, we would ask the Court as a matter
							of urgency to make this determination.</p>
                        <p>President: Did you talk to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> or

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: No, I have not yet
							talked to anybody, 'cause I didn't want to start anything without—</p>
                        <p>President: I think it's worthy of pursuing. I wish you would talk to

                                <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> discussed the matter

							to 'em later in the day. I think that would be very good. I think you
							did well up there. Now, what do you do tomorrow?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: I'm—as far as I'm
							concerned, if we can not get some agreement, which I doubt we can get,
							I'm going to kind of wind up this exercise. I'm not going to put a
							resolution forward, which we, you know, would be vetoed. That isn't
							going to help us. And push the Russians to a veto. So that, my view
							would be that I would—we've done, I think, what we ought to do down here
							and that is we have stated our case and now the responsibility is on the
							Council to come up with a—some help.</p>
                        <p>President: What are they gonna do?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Not a damn thing, just
							between us. They'll fiddle around. But I'll know better today. I'll see
							the Russian today and see if I can get a reading from him that's any
							different from what Tommy has got in Moscow. I'll put it straight to
							him, “Do you fellas want to defuse the situation? Then you ought to put
							your weight to a simple”—what I have in mind is to say to him, “You
							don't have to have a resolution. Let's get the President of the Council
							to propose that there be—the ship and so on be returned and say the
							Council will be prepared to carry on further to consider the matter, and
							so on.” But, I know as I read the telegrams I doubt that the Russians
							would agree to anything. And then we'd let it be known that this is the
							reason why they can't do anything. I don't want to risk a resolution.
							See, we got a good vote on inscription, and I think it's much better to
							let it be where everybody is trying to use some—individually—some
							diplomatic pressure—</p>
                        <p>President: What'd you lose, three votes?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: On the resolution
							itself?</p>
                        <p>President: On the inscription, yeah.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: On the inscription we
							just lost three votes—Russia, Hungary, and Algeria. Now, that's a pretty
							good posture to leave it in. I wouldn't want to lose support as we go
							down the line. So that—but, I'll have a better reading. I'm gonna send
							all the—</p>
                        <p>President: Talk to Nick or Dean. Let them get into this. We're going to
							have to do something when you get through there, and we sure don't want
							to be—we don't even have our people out there. We couldn't do anything
							if we wanted to militarily, so we're gonna have to do something in
							between.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: That's right. And this
							would—of course, the best avenue out there—I don't know whether you saw
							this—I prodded our people to respond quickly. The best avenue out there
							to get our boys back is this Neutral Nations Supervisory Committee.</p>
                        <p>President: Yeah, they're working that carefully.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>: Yes. We got 'em working
							now. Their—those—that consists of the Swedes, the Swiss, the Poles, and
							the Czechs. And we sent a wire last night to get them working.

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We fully understand nature of problems and believe we can meet all of
							them with following approach.</p>
                        <p>2. It is apparent that North Koreans now realize full possible
							consequences of their actions and that Soviets have almost certainly
							told them to defuse situation. Easiest way for them to immediately ease
							acute tension and anger is to return <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew,
							and possibly vessel. It is imperative in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and our interest that nothing be done to interfere with
							this and that we make it as easy as possible for them to get off hook.
							To raise assassination and raider problem as you suggest at same meeting
							will only complicate and delay solution to all our problems.</p>
                        <p>3. The North Koreans will probably talk tough and try to humiliate us and
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. If they do we should let them
							rant and ignore it. The velvet glove approach is the best, for there is
							a steel fist in it, and the North Koreans know it. We should not call
							their attention to it or make any threats, or at this juncture even call
							excessive attention to the gravity of the situation. They know how grave
							it is. We should be business like and non-contentious.</p>
                        <p>4. We expect the first round of talks will produce the release of the
							crew. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should try
							obtain vessel as well. The North Koreans may ask <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> to sign a receipt for the men, as
							they did in the helicopter case, on which is written confession of guilt
							that they were engaged in espionage and violated territorial waters.
								<gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> should not be drawn into
							polemics, and only state quietly and repeatedly that North Koreans have
							their view of matter and we have ours. He is not authorized to sign a
							statement of the kind they are asking for.</p>
                        <p>5. If they insist on apology we should reply all our data indicate no
							violation. If after crew is released and we talk with Bucher and <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0580"/>other crew members we find that
							the vessel was within the territorial waters claimed by North Korea we
							will make this fact public.</p>
                        <p>6. You can say to Park that as soon as the men are released, or if the
							release is long-delayed, announcement will be made of our intention to
							keep augmented forces in the area in view of North Korean campaign
							against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Also you may tell Park
							we are considering substantial additional <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to
							strengthen their anti-infiltration and military forces. We will also
							announce that two destroyers will be provided Korea, with date for
							delivery of first. You can tell Park that we will airlift available
							CIGOREP items as practicable, and will give this program same priority
							as we give Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>7. Para 6 is for Park alone and must not be published in any way.</p>
                        <p>8. We would think that when these announcements are made they will give
							ample assurances to Park and his military leaders and people who are
							concerned and interested. These announcements will be accompanied by
							request by <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> for further senior
							level meetings with North Koreans to press insistently for an end to the
							North Korean violations in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and
							infiltration.</p>
                        <p>9. President Park is a military man, wise and a realist, and the approach
							to him should be made in these terms. The enemy is about to retreat from
							one of its exposed positions. When we take that we will move on the next
							ones.</p>

                        <p>12. We suspect that North Koreans will want private meeting initially,

                        <p>106086. For Ambassador Only.</p>
                        <p>1. It seems obvious from your meetings with <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> and others that Sovs regard official contacts on
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> case awkward and even annoying because
							of inevitable attendant publicity. Same considerations would apply to
							contacts with charge here.</p>
                        <p>2. Nonetheless, it is essential we remain in close communication with
							Sovs to stress gravity of situation. While we are hopeful success
							diplomatic approaches, it is always possible that at later juncture we
							may wish to warn them of actions we may be compelled to take in order to
							obtain release of men and vessel. Purpose then would be to insure that
							Sovs understand limited objectives such action and thus avoid
							miscalculation by other side.</p>
                        <p>3. Hot line is, of course, secure private channel, but we believe this
							would be inappropriate for warnings of impending action as indicated
							para 2 since Sov prestige would be engaged and they would feel compelled
							respond. Its use subject daily inquiry here and confirmation would
							escalate public concern.</p>
                        <p>4. Accordingly, we now giving consideration to establishment, at
							appropriate time, of clandestine channel on Scali-Fomin pattern used
							during Cuban missile crises. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> has proposed we use Kulebiakin, top KGB official
							in US as well as Dep Sov <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> PermRep. Our
							spokesman would be reliable non-official, perhaps Wm. S. White, who
							would be carefully controlled and authorized inform Kulebiakin he acting
							on <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0582"/>precise instructions and at
							specific request of Secretary on behalf of President if this deemed
							necessary in light existing circumstances.</p>
                        <p>5. We do not believe necessary or appropriate officially to inform Sovs
							in advance of establishment of contact. We can assume knowledge of
							contact will be relayed by Kulebiakin through his channels to top Sov
							officials. At some later point, it might be desirable for you to convey
							quietly to <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> your knowledge
							that channel exists and is operative.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>As requested by General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
							on 26 January, I talked by telephone with General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> on the 27th. General
								<persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> had asked me to
							raise with him, at the President's request, several key questions
							concerning the North Korean seizure of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The President was concerned over problems that might face him if he were
							impelled at the end of diplomatic efforts concerning the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> to take some kind of military action. The
							two key questions would be: What actions could be taken; how should the
							Congress be associated with these actions (the experience in the
							Dominican Republic and in Vietnam is pertinent). In presenting these
							questions to General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> I
							stressed that the discussion was entirely confidential and that he was
							in no sense being put “on the spot”.</p>
                        <p>His initial comments were exploratory and tentative. Later he offered
							specific suggestions. He first asked if North Korea has much <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0583"/>maritime trade. I told him it was
							limited but that they do a good deal of fishing. He then asked if any
							thought was given to a quarantine, commenting that this would be about
							the least provocative of any military action and that, if it did not
							suffice the Congress would then have to consider stronger action. He
							thought it was important to act “while the iron is hot” and while the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> affair is fresh in peoples' minds. He
							said we should be careful not to demand or threaten anything that we
							can't back up. Next he raised the possibility of bombing the bridges
							over the Yalu. I pointed out that these lie on the border with Red
							China, and that this action would tend to be a challenge to the Chinese.
							I suggested that there might be critical points on the communications
							routes south of the Yalu. He commented that a key question is whether we
							would be prepared to use atomic weapons, particularly since these would
							give assurance of destruction of bridges, for example, and could be
							utilized in places where no civilian losses would be involved.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said that if he
							were sitting in the President's place he would have the staffs consider
							every possible thing that might be done, not excluding anything out of
							hand, as a basis for top level consideration and decision. He commented
							that he doesn't see much danger of a nuclear holocaust arising over this
							affair. (I had previously mentioned to him the treaties of the USSR and
							the ChiComs with the North Koreans.) He thought that the Russians and
							the Chinese would be guided by their own interests.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion he said his idea would be to take action
							generally as follows and generally in the order indicated:</p>
                        <p>a. Quarantine</p>
                        <p>b. Strengthening of defense arrangements along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> (possibly including some patrolling
							into North Korea).</p>
                        <p>c. Attack of some critical targets along the North Korean main lines of
							communication.</p>
                        <p>d. Movement of U.S. air reinforcements into Korea; action to bring the
							whole command in South Korea to a feasibly high state of readiness;
							ground units should be brought up to strength, but without bringing in
							additional major units.</p>
                        <p>He did think that the plan to take these actions should be spelled out to
							the Congressional leadership. It could be pointed out that some of them
							at least could be initiated on the President's own authority but that,
							in a matter of this kind it is important to have the Congress associated
							with the President, and that this is why he is consulting them. The
							Congressmen should be asked to keep specific details confidential,
							although the general intentions would of course become known.</p>
                        <p>Finally, General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said
							that we should do everything possible to press for action on the
							diplomatic front and in the U.N. Security Council, and should even ask
							for a special session of the <pb n="552" xml:id="pg_552" facs="0584"/>General Assembly if we thought anything useful could be achieved. He
							would intensify the bombing in Vietnam to a maximum at this time, and
							let it be known that this step up was related to the North Korean
							incident.</p>
                        <p>He concluded by asking me to convey to the President his personal hope
							for the President's success in this matter.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I delivered Secretary's message to <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> twelve noon today. He read it in my presence.
							After I had replied negatively to <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>'s question if I had anything to add orally,
								<persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said message would be
							studied carefully and perhaps replied to thereafter. However, he said he
							could say today that if US interested in settlement, it should not exert
							pressure on North Korea, for such pressure prevents and impedes
							settlement. He said he would not exclude the possibility that if there
							were no pressure, something would be done to reach settlement. Thus, he
							repeated, if US wished settlement, it should abandon pressure. If US
							prestige involved in this matter, so is North Korean. As Soviets had
							said earlier, absence of pressure would improve atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> then repeated point he
							made to me January 27 that US should not take at face value its
							information regarding location of vessel. Soviets knew for sure that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> had violated North Korean <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0585"/>territorial waters. There was no doubt
							about this in Soviet mind. Referring to Secretary's statement in letter
							that vessel had not entered <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							territorial waters, <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said
							perhaps Secretary not fully informed. He asked me to inform Secretary
							that Soviets had no doubt whatsoever that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							had entered <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territorial waters. He
							urged US to face facts as that would help reach solution. Once having
							made a statement, US should not insist on repeating it ad infinitum.
							Such line of argument weak and not helpful.</p>
                        <p>3. I said I did not know what <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> had in mind in referring to US pressure. Noting
							we were acting with restraint, I pointed out that other side was talking
							about putting crew on trial as criminals, and our public opinion was
							aroused. We had taken up matter through diplomatic channels and also in
							Security Council. As to vessel's location, I noted we had tapes and
							other evidence. However, if Soviets had some different information,
							other than North Korean statement, we would be grateful for it.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> commented he did not
							exclude possibility of giving us copy of explanation of circumstances of
							incident written in captain's own handwriting. He was not, however, sure
							he would get a copy, but if he did he would give it to us.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> then pointed out that
							his remarks should be understood in the context of earlier Soviet
							statements that USSR could not be an intermediary in this case. However,
							since US turned to Soviets, they told us their point of view and their
							estimate of situation. Soviets would not like us not to pay close
							attention to their views.</p>
                        <p>6. I assured <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> that we
							wanted to settle this affair peacefully and quietly. We did not want to
							create difficulties for other side. I assured him that we would consider
							his remarks very carefully. I also assumed Soviets would want to give
							close study to Secretary's message.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> then referred to
							Secretary's comments about violations of US territorial waters by Soviet
							ships and said he did not remember incidents cited by Secretary.
							However, those were different cases and it was difficult to say if there
							was any analogy between them and the present case.</p>

							that as a problem and be prepared to justify our position. And these are
							the two major matters that I've got the lawyers working on. I will, as
							you suggest, get Cy[rus Vance] further this morning to look at the
							detail. He's gonna be here at least through noon, because I think he
							said he's lunching with you or the group today. In any case, I fully
							agree with you on this. Now, as to time—how we do it and when—Buzz
							Wheeler and I are scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services
							Committee Thursday morning<note n="3" xml:id="d241fn3">February
								1.</note> at 10 o'clock on the 1969 Defense Program and Budget. And
							my guess is we won't even get a word out of our mouths before they say,
							“The hell with that. We want to talk <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.” So
							I have had in mind that I would have to be prepared by Thursday morning.
							As a matter of fact, I was thinking of calling Russell<note n="4" xml:id="d241fn4">Senator Richard Russell, Chairman of the Armed
								Services Committee.</note> today and asking him, without suggesting
							that the Pueblo would come up, asking him how we would like to handle
							the start of the hearing Thursday, because I'm sure they'll want to talk
							Khe Sanh and <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and only incidentally '69.
							And I thought Buzz and I should be prepared for both Southeast Asia and
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> in great detail by Thursday
							morning.</p>
                        <p>President: I don't think there's any doubt about that. [Here follows
							discussion of the situation in Vietnam and of arrangements for a meeting

							Then he gave it to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> turned it into the Chiefs around the 23rd of
							December, and the Chiefs reviewed it. These things are handled on a
							relatively routine basis.<note n="6" xml:id="d241fn6">Before the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> could take any action and before
								the proposal could be sent further, however, the mission required
								approval of the Joint Reconnaissance Center Staff, consisting of a
								representative from each branch of the military, the <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>, the Department of State, and the Secretary of
								Defense. Neither the JRC nor <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
								reviews altered the initial minimal risk assessment associated with
								the mission. (Ibid., pp. 33–34)</note> They reviewed it, and then it
							became part of what's called the Monthly Schedule of Reconnaissance
								Activities,<note n="7" xml:id="d241fn7">The JRC prepared for
								submission to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> the monthly
								schedule on or about the 23d of each month. It was in book form and
								contained broad information about all missions scheduled for the
								coming month. On Wednesday, December 27, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> received the monthly schedule for operations slated
								for January 1968, as did each branch of the Armed Forces, the <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and
								Department of State. Rather than discuss the monthly schedule at a
								routinely held, formal Friday meeting, each Chief approved release
								of the schedule by his Operations Deputy. After their own meeting,
								the Operations Deputies on Friday, December 29, the schedule was
								given to and approved by Nitze. (Ibid., pp. 34–35)</note> and that
							then went, between the 23rd of December and I would guess the end of the
							month—I haven't the exact date yet—to the 303 Committee, on which sits
							the Deputy Secretary of Defense, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Paul
								Nitze</persName>, Dick Helms, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt

							it approved this one.<note n="8" xml:id="d241fn8">The 303 Committee also
								granted civilian approval for the monthly schedule on December 29,
								noting that the mission held the possibility that the ship would
								encounter difficulties and potentially serious harassment. (Ibid.,
								p. 36) <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> analysts also notified
								the JRC and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on December 29 of
								the potential for provocation by the North Koreans, mentioning as
								well that they had no evidence to suggest such harassment would
								occur outside the 12-mile territorial boundary. (Ibid., pp. 37–39
								and 177–178)</note> So, I, myself, I feel personally responsible for
							the mission, because either my deputy or I approves every one of these
							things. So it was approved properly,<note n="9" xml:id="d241fn9">Given

                        <p>Having been fully briefed by the Secretaries of State and Defense
							yesterday, Sunday, January 28 (except for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>),<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> submitted a brief
								memorandum to the President on the briefing, informing him that all
								members agreed that the course currently being followed held a
								possibility for success. They also felt it unwise to take “highly
								visible and provocative action” or to implement military operations
								in North Korea at this time. (Ibid., Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident, Vol. I, Part B [through
								January])</note> the group met at noon to consider the operational
							alternatives immediately ahead of us and, perhaps, further down the
							road. The meeting opened by bringing them up to date with the latest
							word of the Panmunjom contact and <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>'s reaction to Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s message.</p>
                        <p>It was universally agreed that we should make no further diplomatic or
							military moves, beyond those already undertaken and possible <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0589"/>action under paragraph 11, until we
							could form a judgment as to whether the Panmunjom contact might be
							fruitful.</p>
                        <p>The first substantive issue addressed was whether and at what stage the
							President might offer arbitration via the World Court, or some other
							“suitable international tribunal” after the men and the ship were
							returned. After examining the problems posed by the World Court formula
							(implicit recognition of North Korea as a state) and the precedent
							represented by the RB–47 in 1960, it was agreed that some such offer
							might well be made if the Panmunjom exercise doesn't work or is
							bottlenecked.</p>
                        <p>The group then examined the following 11 possible courses of action.<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">A brief analysis of each option prepared by

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Advising Soviets of actual or possible military
								moves</hi>. In the light of Tommy Thompson's cable, it was agreed we
							should not proceed now with an informal contact, although we might
							consider in the future the use of the hot line with the proviso about
							the press, laid down by <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>.<note n="4" xml:id="d242fn4">Not further
								identified.</note> In general, it was judged, however, that
							communications with the USSR were in pretty good shape.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Conduct airborne reconnaissance</hi>. It was agreed
							that for the next several days no recce of North Korea should be
							conducted; if it were judged that recce was desirable at a later time,
							Black Shield, rather than Drone, photography was recommended.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sail USS Banner into area where <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was seized</hi>. For the time being it was felt
							unwise to put the Banner on station.<note n="5" xml:id="d242fn5">A
								telegram from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to the
									<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, January 28, cautioned that
								the proposal to station the Banner off the North Korean coast “could
								be considered by North Korea as threatening in nature and at a
								minimum, provocative.” Accordingly, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> advised postponing the operation until military
								reinforcements ordered to South Korea and the Sea of Japan were in
								place, even though deploying the Banner would be delayed until or
								later than February 2. (Johnson Library, National Security File,
								Country File, Korea—<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Incident, Vol. I,
								Part A [through January])</note> When the incident has been settled,
							it was agreed the U.S. would wish to assert its rights in international
							waters off Wonsan Bay. Depending on the situation at that time, we might
							wish to assert our rights in that area via an armed vessel—perhaps a
							destroyer—rather than via a communications monitoring ship like the USS
							Banner.</p>
                        <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0590"/>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Action to recover crypto material jettisoned from
								the Pueblo</hi>. It was agreed that the recovery of the crypto
							material jettisoned from the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was an almost
							impossible task which would put no significant pressure on the North
							Koreans. Therefore, it should not be undertaken.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Mine Wonsan Harbor</hi>. The proposal presented
							involved 17 sorties dropping 83 mines. The operation would have to be
							repeated as necessary to insure full denial of harbor use. It was agreed
							that the impact of this operation on the North Korean economy and on
							North Korean military capabilities would be minor. The prospects of
							recovery of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the crew might be
							impeded. Air combat over the area would be likely; and the risk of
							escalation would increase if mining were maintained over a protracted
							period.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Seize North Korean vessels</hi>. Although our
							intelligence does not yet give us a firm basis for seizing North Korean
							vessels on the high seas, it was pointed out that should the men and the
							ship—or even the ship alone—not be returned, the seizure of North Korean
							vessels from the high seas was a punishment that fitted the crime; that
							is, the North Koreans had violated the rules governing behavior in
							international waters and could be legitimately denied access to
							international waters. It was agreed to explore this suggestion with
							further staff work directed to establish what North Korean vessels might
							be accessible to seizure on the high seas.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Selected air strikes on North Korea</hi>. It was
							agreed that such strikes would be an act of retaliation; large forces
							required for success might give the appearance of large-scale
							hostilities initiated by the U.S.; it would be unpopular
							internationally; and would diminish the prospects for early release of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Raid across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                            </hi>. As with respect to 7, above, such punitive operations were judged
							to be risky, capable of leading to unsought sustained hostilities, and
							counter-productive with respect to the return of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Naval blockade of Wonsan</hi>. The military and
							economic effects would be limited; the risks of escalation would be
							high; once undertaken, we would be committed for an indefinite period to
							inconclusive, politically awkward, and potentially escalatory
							operations.</p>
                        <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Free World economic pressures on North Korea</hi>.
							The Free World's trade with North Korea is limited. And the impact of
							increased controls of trade and shipping with the Free World would,
							therefore, be small. With respect to a total embargo on trade with North
							Korea, we would certainly meet important opposition from France, the
							United Kingdom, Japan, and West Germany. Taken together, the small scale
							of the inconvenience involved and the political and diplomatic
							difficulties within the Free World make this line of action
							unattractive, on present evidence.</p>
                        <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0591"/>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">U.S. bombing practice in South Korea</hi>. This
							suggestion, from a member of the group, was examined as an additional
							contribution to a sense of seriousness about the U.S. military build up
							in the area. Although it was thought that, in general, our present build
							up offered a satisfactory background for diplomacy, it was agreed that
							the technical possibility of this line of action should be staffed out
							and we would take a further look at it.</p>
                        <p>At lunch today (January 29, 1968) with the President, the group examined
							with the President certain lines of action that might be taken up with
							Congress at a future time. In particular:</p>
                        <p>—Provision to the President of the right to extend the period of
							enlistment;</p>
                        <p>—The maintenance in the area of forces sufficient to give the South
							Koreans a sense of security and provision of sufficient additional
							military aid so that they go forward with their plan to provide an extra
							division to the struggle in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>—It was the universal judgment of the group that we should keep our eye
							on the major objectives in this crisis:</p>
                        <p>—Get the men of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and, if possible, the
							ship itself re- turned;</p>
                        <p>—Keep the confidence of the South Koreans and, especially, their
							willingness to provide an increment of force in South Vietnam;</p>
                        <p>—Avoid a second front in Asia.</p>

                        <p>The President: What about the charge that we called up the reserve
							because of Vietnam and not Korea?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: That is not
							true. We do not need the reserves for Vietnam. In fact, I believe we
							will demobilize the reserves after Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President: I sure like the way in which you announced the movement of
							the aircraft. (The aircraft movement announcement was kept secret in
							terms of numbers and in terms of the units sent.)<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">On January 28 the Department of Defense issued a
								statement that the United States was “taking certain precautionary
								measures to strengthen our forces and to reinforce our tactical air
								capabilities,” mentioning only that “certain units” had been
								“alerted for possible movement.” The statement was reportedly
								intended as a reply to an article in The Las Vegas Review-Journal
								that identified specific units affected by the alert. (The New York
								Times, January 29, 1968)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: 56 land-based
							aircraft have already arrived in South Korea. There are 68 planes on
							carriers. This is roughly 125 already available in South Korea. We will
							move in 30 more tonight. 29 more are in route.</p>
                        <p>The President: How many aircraft do we need in South Korea to handle the
							situation?</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: The North
							Koreans have 450 planes. We need at least an equivalent number in South
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President: Well, I want all of you to know that you have had complete
							freedom on this matter. But you have got to be ready. I think all of you
							should be prepared to explain why, if the ship captain needed planes and
							they were not there, why it was. They were not there because it was not
							prudent from a military standpoint for them to be there.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: That is correct,
							Mr. President. I have General <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> sorting out all the facts. There are several
							reasons why no planes were sent. This includes the location of the ship,
							the time of day, the inclement weather and the fact that there was
							superior enemy air power in the area.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: We had only

							vessel?</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MATJ1">Moorer</persName>: It would be a
							provocative act. We could not accomplish the mission. It would take all
							the entire Navy to escort them.</p>
                        <p>The President: I think you should set up an independent board to
							investigate this whole matter to head off any investigations by the
							Congress or other groups. Have you checked this Gulf of Tonkin incident
							theory?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Yes, sir.</p>
                        <p>The President: I think you should take the orders, explain them, and
							justify them. I do not have a log of this incident yet which is
							satisfactory to me. Everybody is looking for a scapegoat, and you had
							better get the facts.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_MCGJP1">McConnell</persName>: Commander
							Bucher did not know he was in serious trouble in time to do anything

                        <p>The President: Well, say it.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: We would have
							been in a fine fix if we had sent planes up there. We probably would
							have been in a war.</p>
                        <p>The President: You should go up to Congress with all of your guns
							blazing. Give them the facts before they have time to question you on
							them. I thought Senator Stennis handled himself very well yesterday. Did
							anyone talk with him before he went on the air?</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: We have ten

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The odds are

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: It depends on

                        <p>The President: There should be an independent investigation of this
							incident and all of the complexities involved by a good panel. I would
							suggest Admiral McDonald, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
								Ball</persName>, General Ridgeway, an Army General, and a good Naval
								Admiral.<note n="3" xml:id="d244fn3">On February 3 <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reported to the President that
								a committee composed of himself, General <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark</persName>, and General McDonald had begun work and asked

								explained to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, “I just
								want you and an Army man—I want an independent State Department man,
								a diplomat, with some international background, United Nations
								background, and negotiations background, and I want an Army man
								that's got some background with Korea, and I want a Navy man knows

								suggested adding “a retired Air Force General who knows something
								about Korea” and informed the President that General Wyland had been
								recommended by <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>. The

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: I would

                        <p>The President: Before I select a lawyer I always look at the jury. We
							should have a man who will appeal to the various elements that will be
							judging us.</p>
                        <p>The GI Bill of Rights is educating 400,000 and enabling 200,000 to buy
							houses. (The President was reading from a proposed message to the
							Congress on Veterans which will be sent up on Tuesday.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Time Magazine
							said the reservists who were called up had good morale. Newsweek said
							many of them were grumbling.</p>
                        <p>George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I have seen a cynical
							assertion that the reserves were called under the pretext of Korea but
							for actual use in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: That is
							untrue. We have 361 planes going to South Korea without pulling any away
							from Vietnam or Southeast Asia or Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>If we get the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew back, we will
							de-activate the reservists in all probability. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
							agreed with this in a meeting we have just completed.</p>
                        <p>The President: There is no need to call up the reserves for Vietnam. In
							fact, General Westmoreland would rather go without reserves in Vietnam.
							We called the reserves to substitute in this country for units which are
							being sent to South Korea. Of course we could call up reserves at
							anytime without Korea if we wanted.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt</persName>, would you review where we
							stand with my outside counselors who are here today?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: We have discussed
							three principal issues. Then we went through the ten military
							alternatives and added at least one suggestion.</p>
                        <p>We reported to the group that we have put our position in writing to the
							North Koreans at Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>We have discussed the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> letter
							to <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>
                            </hi>. In [reply to] it, <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>
							said he knew for sure that we <hi rend="italic">had</hi> entered Korean
							territorial waters because the ship's captain had said he had entered
							territorial waters in his own handwriting.<note n="4" xml:id="d244fn4">See <ref target="#d240">Document 240</ref>.</note> We do not
							believe he did. But we cannot deny it because we do not have the
							captain's log.</p>
                        <p>The President: On that point, are we reasonably sure that we are right?
							What are my odds?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The odds are
							three to one that we are right. We do not believe the commander got into
							territorial waters. We know both from our own messages and from the
							messages of the North Koreans that he was seized outside territorial
							waters. The captain's <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0596"/>orders
							were clear. The conditions were precise. But as Nick Katzenbach has
							said, even if he did go into North Korean waters the action which the
							North Koreans took is not a very appropriate one.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: The evidence
							is quite good and quite strong that the detention was [not] made in
							territorial waters. We have a fix on the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							at 8:30 when he was 25 miles out. He must have been outside of that area
							several hours before.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The ship was on
							radio silence. We do not have the log. The captain broke radio silence
							the day before and broke it when accosted by the North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: We still
							would not know for sure if the ship had gone into territorial waters. We
							do not believe that it did. It would not show on the ship's log unless
							the captain had something special to report. Otherwise he would log
							items as he regularly does three times a day.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: What <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> has said is that the North
							Koreans have it in the captain's own handwriting that he did violate
							territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The President: We do know at the times he gave fixes that he was not in
							territorial waters and could not have gotten there.</p>
                        <p>We should leave ourselves a loophole until we know precisely what
							happened. We do know what his orders were.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: If we see
							something down the road which is attractive, we may want to leave
							ourselves a little room for a minor admission if that is what they want
							for return of the ship and the men.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: We gave him
							instructions not to go inside of the 13 mile limit. We must keep in mind
							there might have been a navigational error of one mile on our side and
							one mile on the North Korean side. If you assume for a moment that both
							made errors, that could place the ship 11 miles from shore. We still
							could not accept their claim of being only 7 miles away.</p>
                        <p>The President: All of you should get together and have your very best
							legal minds work out what we should say.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: I have five
							lawyers working on this now. We should have a defense briefing by
							tomorrow night.</p>
                        <p>The President: Let's make our own study to review the facts, ask all the
							questions and then present this information to the committee.<note n="5" xml:id="d244fn5">Reference is probably to the Senate Foreign
								Relations Committee, to which a lengthy, substantive report was sent
								on March 20; see <ref target="#d228fn13">footnote 13, Document
									228</ref>.</note> We must make sure we don't do more damage with
							our own speeches.</p>
                        <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0597"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: A public
							announcement of our own investigation would throw doubt on our own
							position.</p>
                        <p>The President: What about a private investigation?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: That is fine.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: This would
							be a broad investigation, not just limited to the position of the
							ship.</p>
                        <p>The President: Yes, that is right. It would answer all the questions
							which are being raised. I suggest all of you get together and decide on
							an impartial board. I would put on it Admiral McDonald, George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and General Mark Clark.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Mundt said you had
							no business having the ship there anyway.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: What about the
							questions of putting the problem before the World Court. Each side could
							select an arbitrator and let the President of the World Court select a
							third name.</p>
                        <p>There are ten items for possible military action:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Airborne reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p>The group is against this. The photographic coverage has been excellent
							from the Oxcart and Black Shield missions.</p>
                        <p>For the moment we do not need it. The group is against the use of drones.
							To have one shot down would be very bad.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. The build-up of aircraft in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The group thinks this action is good and that we need it to back up our
							diplomatic efforts.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Replacing the Pueblo with the U.S.S.
							Banner.</p>
                        <p>The group feels we should not carry this out now. After the matter
							settles we may want to re-establish our position under international law
							and replace the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> with an armed vessel.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Send divers to get the crypto gear.</p>
                        <p>The group felt this was a fruitless effort which would not pay off. To do
							this would require armed escorts and risk a possible confrontation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">5. Mining Wonsan Harbor.</p>
                        <p>This would require 17 sorties. It might lead to more trouble. It would
							not hurt them much.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> interrupted to say
							that many of these alternatives had been deferred pending contacts with
							the North Koreans and contacts through the United Nations. The Secretary
							predicted there would be a meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0598"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">6. Seizure of North Korean vessels.</p>
                        <p>This action would be taken only if we were to determine that the men and
							the ships would not be returned promptly. This idea has certain appeal.
								<persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> liked this as
							a sanction for them and to encourage them to let this ship and men
							go.</p>
                        <p>There is a difficulty on this, since it is unclear which ships to pick up
							and their value.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">7. Selected air strikes over North Korea.</p>
                        <p>This was felt to be excessive. This would require a very substantial air
							engagement and would heighten the conflict.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">8. Raids across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The group felt this to be too risky.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">9. A naval blockade.</p>
                        <p>The group felt this to run a high risk of retaliatory action and we do
							not know when the blockade would end.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">10. Application of free world economic
							pressure.</p>
                        <p>Korean trade is not great with the free world. We would have trouble
							getting many of the countries such as Japan aboard.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> said consideration
							was being given to advising the Soviets of actual or possible
							retaliatory action. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> recommended against this.</p>
                        <p>It was generally agreed that no further reference to any use or non-use
							of the hot line should be made by George <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Christian</persName> or any other briefing officers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> said that Ambassador
							Lodge had raised the question of having bombing practice in South Korea
							using bombing ranges there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> said the build-up that we
							are undertaking there now is impressive both to North Koreans and to the
							other countries involved.</p>
                        <p>Cyrus Vance: I would recommend further reconnaissance flights,
							particularly more Oxcart missions over the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to determine any possible build-up of North Korean
							forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>: The group also
							considered the type of statement the President might want to make. We
							will have a draft by the end of the day.</p>
                        <p>The President: I want to say as little as I can. That three-minute
							statement last week was re-assuring.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> thinks that the U.S.
							people and the world believe in a decision by a court.</p>
                        <p>After we run out all of our moves in the United Nations, we must consider
							if we are willing to go into an international world court. There, <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0599"/>we could submit all of our
							evidence. They could submit theirs. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> thinks we should [be] prepared to do that.</p>
                        <p>George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: There are problems
							with a world court. It recognizes North Korea as a state. But we should
							consider the use of an impartial tribunal.</p>
                        <p>The President: Shouldn't we answer all these questions about our being
							spread too thin?</p>
                        <p>George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>: I think Admiral
							McDonald can do this.</p>
                        <p>Cyrus Vance: You cannot submit this matter to a tribunal until you see
							what happens at the meeting in Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>The President: I want you (Vance), and Mac Bundy to give me a statement
							to make in case there is one which should be made.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: This group is
							paralyzed because of the Panmonjom conference. They needed to know what
							will come out of that before they can make any kind of statement.</p>
                        <p>The President: I still want <persName>Bundy</persName>, George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Cyrus Vance to get me a
							statement on what I might say, if anything.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>: You have a
							promising pair of contacts in the Soviets and in North Korea. I would
							say that my diplomats are at work and I am not going to say anything
							right now.</p>
                        <p>If you look at the courses available they are very unattractive. No one
							ever thought a small power such as North Korea would take offensive
							action against a major power in a situation such as this.</p>
                        <p>Any warfare will pin these boys in rather than get them out. We are too
							big a power to start a war over this. The punishment of picking up their
							ships fits the crime.</p>
                        <p>You do not know what happened precisely in the ten days the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was on station. As long as the commander
							is in hock you will not know. I would not be making any statements about
							the number of planes which we have moved to South Korea. Somebody will
							ask, O.K., what are you going to do now that you have them here?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: In terms of
							parallels the shooting down of the RB–47 in 1960 is the closest. It took
							seven months to get those two fliers back.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>: You never know
							exactly what the motives of the North Koreans are in this matter. If it
							was to embarrass us, they have done that. If it was to inflict a loss on
							our intelligence, they have done that.</p>
                        <p>They may be seeking to cause trouble with our allies. They may want to
							interrupt the flow of Korean aid to Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We should make every effort to keep South Korean plans going as scheduled
							in sending supplies to Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>The President then read a memo from a distinguished American. (The
							President later identified this as General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.) This memo outlined what courses this
							“distinguished American thought were offered to us.” (That memo is
							attached as appendix A.)<note n="6" xml:id="d244fn6">See <ref target="#d239">Document 239</ref>.</note>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: Any way you look
							at it this incident is a loser. We cannot come out even. We must cut our
							losses. I doubt we will ever want to use any one of the ten military
							alternatives. Of course one can never know what the exact situation was
							unless we talk with the captain. We must make some kind of disposition
							of the matter.</p>
                        <p>I believe consideration should be given to the idea of going to the world
							court. There are nine members on it, and they have some members friendly
							to them. In conclusion we end up having taken some sort of a bump. The
							next time they try it, let's be ready to give it back to them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Let's look at how
							we formulate this court matter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I am
							inclined to think the President should have the Leadership in.</p>
                        <p>The President: I am having the Leadership in for breakfast tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>: I do not
							think we should ask Congress for anything before we get all the
							facts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: Within the
							next 72 hours we will announce an increase in our military aid to South
							Korea. This will show the North Koreans the price they will pay for this
							incident is heavy.</p>
                        <p>The President: Walt, will you take the questions we are getting asked
							most often and have them answered for me? We will tell them that we are
							still exploring the diplomatic alternatives; we do not want to add to
							our problems. We will have General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> explain the military pitch. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> will discuss the diplomatic
							moves.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge: This situation has a lot of qualities of a
							kidnapping case. If you use force you kill the victim. We do not want to
							kill the boys or open up a second front. The reason I talked about
							bombing maneuvers in South Korea was to raise the feeling of awe.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Joe Sisco</persName> to come and talk to me about
							the following:</p>
                        <p>1. The Secretary General, through Ralph Bunche, has suggested that the
							Security Council, by means of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
							“consensus,” call on Thant to provide good offices. This same proposal
							has been transmitted by the Secretary General to the USSR simultaneously
							through Nesterenko. <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> is
							unaware how much prior discussion, if any, the Secretary General has had
							with the Soviets.</p>
                        <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>2. Thant proposes that the attached “consensus”<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">Not printed.</note> be adopted by the Security
							Council. As you note, the Secretary General would “be invited to take
							the initiative and offer his good offices in whatever manner he may
							consider appropriate and helpful.” This would be said in the context of
							reducing the prevailing tension and finding an acceptable solution. If
							the consensus is adopted, the Secretary General would send Deputy
							Foreign Minister of Rumania, Mircea Malitza, to Pyongyang. Thant has
							already discussed this proposal with the Rumanians who are agreeable to
							sending Malitza on this mission.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has already told
							Arthur <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> that:</p>
                        <p>—he agrees that we could not oppose this kind of a proposal if it
							develops in the context of the Security Council discussions;</p>
                        <p>—however, we need time to see how the direct contacts at Panmunjom go to
							assure that such an initiative at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
							not cross with our efforts at Panmunjom;</p>
                        <p>—he react positively to the Secretary General, but tell him candidly that
							we do need time and that we do want to see how the bilateral contact
							progresses before making any final determination on the desirability of
							a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intermediary going forward;</p>
                        <p>—if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intermediary is sent to
							Pyongyang, he should discuss with the Secretary General the possibility
							of sending someone else to the Republic of Korea and to the United
							States to also discuss this matter.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to discuss this matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> on the telephone and consider it
							further at tomorrow's lunch.</p>

                        <p>Between January 29 and January 31, 1968, the United States and North
							Korea established the foundation for face-to-face discussions on the
							fate of the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew, after the
								<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Senior Member of the Military
							Armistice Commission submitted two messages from the U.S. Government to
							the North Korean Senior Member. The first message responded to
							information received from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission,
							and the second requested an immediate private meeting between the Senior
							Members of each side. (Telegram 3755 from Seoul, January 30; National
							Archives and Records Administration, <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0603"/> RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US) In response the North Koreans agreed to
							private meetings between the two principals and proposed that each side
							be assisted by an official translator and a liaison officer. By mutual
							agreement the meetings were held in the conference room of the Neutral
							Nations Supervisory Commission in the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom.
							(Telegrams 3744 from Seoul, January 29, and 3794 from Seoul, January 31;
							both ibid.)</p>
                        <p>After receiving a message from Rear Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> suggesting a meeting of the two Senior Members on
							February 1, the North Koreans countered with a proposal offering to meet
							on February 2 at 11 a.m. local time. Since a “delay of at least one day
							is customary communist tactic,” Rear Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> accepted the alternate date.
							(Telegram 3826 from Seoul, February 1; ibid.) The closed meeting
							convened in the Neutral Nations conference room and was limited to four
							persons on each side: the senior member, an interpreter, an assistant,
							and a junior liaison officer. (Telegram 3856 from Seoul, February 1;
							ibid.) The Department of State notified Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> in Moscow and Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> in Tokyo of the
							details of the meeting and transmitted the text of a statement
							indicating that, since North Korea had rejected working through the
							United Nations to resolve the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crisis, the
							United States was prepared to handle the issue through the Military
							Armistice Commission at Panmunjom. (Telegram 108288 to Moscow and Tokyo,
							February 1; ibid.) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> notified the Department of State of his intention
							to inform President Pak of the upcoming meeting. (Telegram 3832 from

                        <p>The President: I thought we did very little good, very little harm.
							General <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> was not a good

							questions we get and answer them with authority with Senator Dirksen and

								Room at the White House. (Notes of the President's Meeting with the

                        <p>Senator Edward Kennedy says the Vietnamese government steals about 50% of

                        <p>To what do you attribute the confession by Captain Bucher, General

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: The North
							Koreans could have used drugs. They probably gave him something to copy
							and required him to write it out in his own hand. This may have been a
							deal to get the ship and the men released.</p>
                        <p>The President: What about the possibility of this Officer having
							turned?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>: The

                                <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> furnished <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> with a copy of a <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report, January 30, entitled “A

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>: There is some
							worry at the United Nations that the Soviets are ready to surface
							portions of the ship's log showing it to be in territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The President: Is it typical of the Soviets to be so firm on a thing such
							as this (Soviets have charged several times that the ship was inside

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: The Soviets will
							say something knowing the facts to be to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>The President: I am jittery about the possibility of error. This Officer
							doesn't look like the normal, prudent, alert Officer I would have handle

                            <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark Clifford</persName>: What is our
							position if we are wrong, Dean?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: If we are convinced
							we are wrong, we would probably exchange a statement of regret.</p>
                        <p>The President: If we do not get the men back, what then?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Even if the ship
							were to be found to have trespassed territorial waters, the North
							Koreans still had no right to do what they did.</p>

							North Korea has made no public statements on this, which is
							encouraging.</p>
                        <p>We do not know what will happen at Panmunjom. At the United Nations Ralph
							Bunche asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName>
							for permission to use the good offices of the Secretary General to send
							a Rumanian to North Korea. We advised Bunche that this did not bother us

									<gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> channel, <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> requested that Bunche

								negative, thus creating the need to restructure an approach to the
								North Koreans through the Secretary General's good offices.

                        <p>108338. 1. If <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> proposes you sign receipt comparable
							to that given by <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> for
							helicopter pilots Stutts and Voltz in May 1964, suggest you counter with
							following arguments:</p>
                        <p>a. Facts on helicopter pilots were quite different, and that case is no
							precedent for proper handling of this one.</p>
                        <p>b. Our side recognized that pilots had entered airspace over territory
							under control of your side and landed in North Korea; there was no
							dispute about these facts.</p>
                        <p>c. Case of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> is quite different. Your side
							has asserted vessel was in territorial waters of North Korea at time of
							seizure. Our information, based on reporting of positions not only by
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> but also by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> vessels participating in seizure, shows <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was more than fifteen nautical miles
							seaward from nearest <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territory—Ung Do
							Island. In our view there is no possibility <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in territorial waters at time of seizure even if
							such waters were measured as extending twelve nautical miles from coast,
							as claimed by some countries.</p>
                        <p>d. Our side will, of course, conduct further inquiry into facts of
							incident once crew have been released and we have access to information
							they can provide.</p>
                        <p>2. You should not agree to or sign any receipt or other statement except
							unconditional release. You should refer any <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> proposals to Washington for instructions and propose
							another meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0609"/>
                        <p>3. At this stage it is impossible to foresee development of exchanges in
							Panmunjom. We will need to review developments as they occur. Our
							tentative thinking on some possibilities, <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>, is as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. One possible course might be form of receipt in which positions of
							both sides are accurately reflected as to <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							facts. We might agree to formulation of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> position proposed by them, so long as it is clearly
							stated to be theirs. Our position might then be set forth along
							following lines: “According to our data, USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, a commissioned war vessel of the United States Navy,
							was in international waters at the time of its seizure by North Korean
							naval units, at a distance of more than fifteen nautical miles from the
							nearest point in North Korean territory.” This for your information and
							not to be put forward without further instructions.</p>
                        <p>b. Also for your info and not to be put forward: It is altogether
							unlikely <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> would be interested in having
							receipt embody any statement as to what either side would do on basis of
							further inquiry into <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident following
							release of crew. However, if they should propose statement to effect
							that US will make some kind of amends if it is later determined, after
							crew and vessel released, that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in the
							territorial waters, we could agree to balanced statement along following
							lines: “If further investigation should disclose that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in the territorial sea of North Korea,
							US Govt would express its regret and give assurance against recurrence
							of incident. If further investigation should disclose that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in international waters, North Korea
							would express its regret and make appropriate reparation.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side will not, of course, accept
							anything like this, but balanced statement would be appropriate counter
							to any <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> proposal on subsequent
								steps.<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">Printed from an unsigned

                        <p>You asked for our thoughts on possible US proposals for impartial

							case. Listed below are several proposals, which could either be advanced
							here or by Arthur <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Goldberg</persName> in New
							York.</p>
                        <p>Frankly, I doubt that the North Koreans would accept any of the
							proposals. Nor would the Soviets permit the Security Council to act
							affirmatively on them. But there might be some advantage to
							demonstrating confidence in our own case, while challenging the North
							Koreans to put up or shut up.</p>
                        <p>However, I think we should hold up on any proposals until we see the
							results of the talks now going on in Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>If we do decide to go ahead with one of the proposals, we must make it
							clear that our willingness to proceed is dependent on the prior release
							of the crew and ship. To do otherwise would give the North Koreans an
							excuse for refusing to release either vessel or crew until the
							investigation or adjudication is completed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Proposals</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>—A US statement that we would welcome an impartial fact-finding or
							adjudication of the legal issues raised by the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure. We would state at the time of the announcement
							that we are prepared to accept and carry out the findings and
							recommendations made by an impartial tribunal. If the tribunal finds
							against us, we will make appropriate amends; if it finds in our favor,
							we expect North Korea to do the same.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">An arbitral tribunal</hi>. For example, we could
							propose a three-member tribunal consisting of one arbitrator named by
							the United States, one named by the North Koreans, and a third named by
							agreement. (If no agreement, the third member would be named by the
							President of the International Court of Justice.) The tribunal would be
							empowered to reach its decisions by majority vote. (A single arbitrator
							or a panel named by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security
							Council are possible variations on this theme.)</p>
                        <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0611"/>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">The Security Council itself undertakes an
								investigation under Article 34 of the United Nations Charter</hi>.
							This proposal, of course, would be subject to veto but—assuming no
							veto—the Council could establish an investigating body which would be

                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">The Security Council asks the International Court of
								Justice for an advisory opinion</hi>. We would state our readiness
							to cooperate fully in the proceedings and to carry out the findings of
							the Court. We would insist that North Korea indicate that they would be

							case go to the <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> for adjudication,

                        <p>3863. 1. We are maintaining close contact with highest <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> levels in effort to calm recurrent
							fears that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew aspect of problem with
							North Koreans will soon be settled, leaving <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> only unsatisfied party. Presidential Secretary General
							informed me this morning that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							interpret <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> statement that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> machinery not acceptable but <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> prepared to use <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> at Panmunjom to mean that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s are prepared to make concessions on <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew. This led to usual discussion of aftermath, if
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> supposition proves to be
							correct.</p>
                        <p>2. PSG expressed uneasiness about this morning's meeting but was
							reassured by scenario related State 108330,<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">Telegram 108330 to Seoul, February 1, provided guidance on media
								responses, should North Korea make an announcement or broadcast
								about the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting.
								(Ibid.)</note> particularly our desire to have <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> issue statement confirming that
							meeting arranged after consultation with them and that they completely
							informed and in close touch with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
							these matters. In addition to stress on fact that <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> machinery being utilized to deal with
							aggressive <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> actions against <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, I said they could take line with press
							if necessary that private meetings on this or that aspect of problem
							might be held from time to time and that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> confer in
							this connection. He said they <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0612"/>would issue statement to above effect after hearing from us (or by
							other means) that Pyongyang had announced fact of meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. During conversation with PSG this morning he brought out fact that
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s have done substantial amount of
							military planning. I avoided discussion on this by saying we still very
							much in diplomatic stage of our effort and that present not good time
							for discussion of military aspects. I reminded him that we were pleased
							to have President Park's assurance that there would be no unilateral
							reaction by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. Lee Hu-rak said he
							understood but time may be approaching for serious discussion of
							military matters.</p>
                        <p>4. While they have thus far been amenable to intensive persuasion and
							have accepted our tactics, it will be apparent to you that desirability
							of military action against <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s runs

                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Begin Summary</hi>. RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> opened with brief prepared
							statement. Said he had called meeting to discuss serious situation
							resulting from fact <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> has possession
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew. Said US position is that
							ship did not enter <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territorial waters
							until after it was seized and that crew committed no crime whatever.
							Recognized that US and <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0613"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> positions differ. Said this situation
							completely without precedent. Stressed interests of both sides would be
							served by immediate return of crew and early return of ship to US
							custody. Expressed hope that meeting would result in agreement in
							principle on return of ship and crew as soon as physical arrangements
							can be completed.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to repeated demands from Pak that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> say all he had to say,
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> made following
							additional points:</p>
                        <p>(A) Time would be saved if neither side mentioned confessions,
							admissions, punishments or apologies.</p>
                        <p>(B) Repeated several times that he had come to request return of ship and
							crew, names of wounded and dead.</p>
                        <p>(C) Explained at some length why <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> case is
							unprecedented and difference between it and helicopter incident. In
							accordance guidance received, pointing out that ship had violated no
							laws, that it was not under UNC command but was unit of US Pacific
							Fleet, and that there no violation to admit, as was case with
							helicopter.</p>
                        <p>(D) Set forth international law aspects in accordance guidance contained
							State 108367,<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">See <ref target="#d250fn2">footnote 2, Document 250</ref>.</note> emphasizing that even if
							Pueblo had been in <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> waters, proper
							procedure would have been to escort it back to international waters as
							is practice followed between US and USSR.</p>
                        <p>4. As it became obvious Pak would not respond until he had exhausted
							efforts to draw <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> out,
							latter began insisting that Pak make statement to which he would reserve
							right to reply. Pak responded that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew
							are aggressors and criminals dispatched to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territorial waters for aggressive purpose as made clear
							by their confession. Stated that thanks to humanitarian measures of
								<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>, wounded are receiving medical
							treatment, dead body of one crew member has been preserved, and all
							remaining members are in good health without any inconvenience. Said it
							unnecessary to cover up or explain away criminal act. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> denied commission of criminal
							act, noting that ship had not fired back, had offered no resistance, had
							violated no law. Said “criminal act” could only be descriptive of North
							Korean actions.</p>
                        <p>5. After further exchange <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							asked Pak to suppose that KPA vehicle in <gloss target="#t_JSA1">JSA</gloss> or other neutral area were suddenly seized by UNC,
							taken South, and its crew were made to confess that truck was South of
								<gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. Said he supposed in such case
							North Koreans would wish to have truck back. Such situation was
							analogous way we feel about <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>6. Pak, after obvious pause for editing, then read prepared statement in
							which he said <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had merely
							attempted cover up plain fact of aggression and that US had deliberately
							dispatched armed spy ship to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							territorial waters, which constitutes most flagrant violation of
							Armistice Agreement. Claimed North Koreans have in their hands all <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0614"/>the material and human evidence
							to prove US committed act of aggression. Said matter can in no way be
							solved by US proposal to meet solely for purpose of rejustifying
							criminal act. Said if US really wants to solve matter it must change
							stand and attitude in addressing subject.</p>
                        <p>7. Pak continued that “I have not yet been instructed” to inform US side
							of names of dead and wounded. He then concluded prepared statement by
							proposing recess this meeting and saying <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> “will be informed” of date for next meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d254fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> commented on Pak's
								approach in telegram 3892, February 2, “By tantalizing us in this
								manner, by offering prospect of further meeting and information
								which he knows we badly want, North Koreans probably seeking to
								string this affair out for variety of purposes which will be
								apparent to Dept., but which here in Korea include enhancing
								opportunities for friction between ourselves and <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> rejoined that he could
							provide much more proof than he already given that ship was in
							international waters if such would be useful at this time. Pak rejected
							this offer and repeated <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							would be informed later of next meeting.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows a summary of the February 2 meeting, see <ref target="#d254">Document 254</ref>.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                        <p>4. Our initial judgment of the first meeting is as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. The North Koreans were expecting that we would say what we did, but we
							were less certain what they would say.</p>
                        <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583" facs="0615"/>
                        <p>b. The North Koreans did not make any explicit demands or threats (e.g.,
							exchange for prisoners held in the south, threats to try the Captain
							and/or the crew, reduce pressure on them, etc.), other than alluding to
							the necessity that we admit that we engaged in “espionage,” violated
							territorial waters and the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>c. The atmosphere of the meeting was businesslike and apparently without
							the usual heavy-handed North Korean insults.</p>
                        <p>d. So far the North Koreans have refrained from announcing this initial
							meeting. (The greatest danger of press leaks seems to be in Seoul.)</p>
                        <p>5. In sum, we believe the meeting went about as well as could be
							expected. The North Koreans did not, at least at this stage, raise the
							ante to include other demands, but they might well do this in the
							future. They took care to keep this channel open while retaining the
							initiative in calling another meeting. This does not foreclose our
							asking for another meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. We have asked Seoul for their views of how to approach the next
							meeting and what to say at the meeting, and are working on our own
							scenario. Our guess is that the North Koreans will give us 24 to 48
							hours to study what they said before suggesting the next. That meeting
							might perhaps narrow the issue, so we would expect a third or fourth
							meeting before we see clearly where we are. It is conceivable they may
							want to drag this out, although the Task Force still feels that they
							want to release the men soon in order to get the heat out of the
							situation.</p>
                        <p>7. I have sent a cable asking Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> to request through the Joint Duty Officers at
							Panmunjom the names of the injured and dead.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> and Doherty were
							encouraged by the first meeting, saying that the North Koreans obviously
							wanted to keep the door open. I am not. It was completely negative.
								<persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> feels that the North
							Koreans <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0616"/>find themselves in a
							box and want a fairly prompt out. I think nothing of the sort. I think
							they will want to prolong the series of meetings because:</p>
                        <p>—the status quo is a victory for them;</p>
                        <p>—prolonged meetings without result will greatly exacerbate our relations
							with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> (already worrisome);</p>
                        <p>—for further exploitation of ship and crew;</p>
                        <p>—enormous prestige from keeping the United States on the hook longer;</p>
                        <p>—the Soviets have reportedly predicted to the North Koreans that our
							reaction to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure would be mild and
							so far the North Koreans may feel that this has been the case, despite
							our show of force, hence safe to prolong;</p>
                        <p>—in addition to prestige arising from keeping us on the hook, there is
							also prestige arising from “equality” in bilateral talks under less than
							UNC auspices.</p>
                        <p>We must carefully watch people at State who tend to think of next steps
							at Panmunjom chiefly in terms of valid arguments. It is important to
							remember that we tend to talk from Aristotelian, syllogistic logic,
							whereas the North Koreans think only in terms of Communist dialectic
							“logic.” That difference was never more apparent than from the verbatim
							account of last night's meeting. The entire meeting was completely in
							character.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe we will budge these people short of a careful, reasoned
							raising of the temperature. However, I think it probable that we should
							wait 48 hours after the last meeting to see whether there will be a
							prompt second meeting at which we can take their temperature better. We
							could not expect any reading from this first encounter. We should not
							wait much longer before applying a little more heat—political
							(Soviets—Mac Toon working on letter) and military (several studies in
							progress, should get two tonight).<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">A draft

                        <p rend="center">DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND THE NEXT MEETING IN PANMUNJOM</p>
                        <p>The North Korean representative at the February 2 meeting implied the
							possibility of release for the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew if
							the United States were to accept the North Korean version of the facts
							and acknowledge that an act of aggression had occurred involving a US
							violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The North Koreans might
							also press for an apology and an assurance that there would be no
							repetition. Release might be obtained if the United States were prepared
							to sign a statement or receipt incorporating the above elements.</p>
                        <p>Our scenario for the next meeting has been prepared for the purpose of
							setting forth fully the US position. We do not suppose that it will
							induce any release by North Korea. It contains one forthcoming element,
							in the form of a proposal to hold a US investigation and to express
							regret publicly if that investigation bears out the North Korean version
							of the facts. There are a number of other moves that can be made by the
							two sides in subsequent meetings.</p>
                        <p>The North Koreans, for example, may peel off various of the elements from
							their package. Or they might propose that any release be in exchange for
							North Koreans held prisoner in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
							They might conceivably agree to release of the officers and crew while
							retaining the vessel. Or they might agree to release of the officers and
							crew minus the captain, whom they might wish to hold for a further
							period as they did in 1967 with the captain of a Japanese fishing
							vessel.</p>
                        <p>Other North Korean positions are also conceivable, and should surface in
							the next meetings.</p>
                        <p>The following are some of the positions that the United States could
							consider with a view to release of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							crew:</p>
                        <p>1. We could consider release accompanied by a statement declaring that we
							would make a full investigation of the charges brought by North Korea,
							that the results of the investigation would be notified to <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0618"/>the North Koreans, and that the North
							Korean authorities reserve all their rights in this matter.</p>
                        <p>2. Another possibility would be a balanced statement of the positions of
							the two sides as the immediate prelude to release of the crew (and
							vessel); such of the North Korean positions as they insisted upon could
							be included, and our basic positions would be stated.</p>
                        <p>3. We could certainly consider a release accompanied by a statement
							omitting any mention of either side's positions and saying instead that
							the release was based on humanitarian grounds.</p>
                        <p>4. We could propose an impartial fact-finding or determination on
							disputed issues, to take place after the release of the crew (and
							vessel); our proposal would embody the following elements:</p>
                        <p>(a) If the determination were in favor of North Korea, the United States
							would be prepared to express regret;</p>
                        <p>(b) If the determination were in favor of the United States, North Korea
							would make appropriate reparation.</p>
                        <p>5. Still another variant would be release accompanied by a statement that
							the decision to effect release was made by North Korea without prejudice
							to its right to demand satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>6. Still another possibility would be a statement recounting that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> had been taken into custody by North Korea
							on January 23 and that release was being effected on the understanding
							that the United States would ensure that its vessels do not enter into
							the territorial sea of North Korea. [This statement would be phrased in
							a way that could not properly be interpreted as an admission of
								guilt.]<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">Brackets in the source
								text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. We might want to consider, as a move to be made by the United States
							at some point, the withdrawal of naval units currently operating south
							of the 38th parallel, if such an action would be decisive in obtaining
							release.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Number 3 has been cleared in the Korean Working Group; the others are
							still in various stages of clearance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>It is clear to me that each of these contemplated actions involves risks.
							The numerical order in which they are listed above indicates a
							descending order of preference in terms of combining minimum risk and
							maximum pressure.</p>
                        <p>1. Air Reconnaissance over North Korea is probably first in order of
							preference, confined to the use of Black Shield. It would appear to the
							North Koreans either as a form of pressure or as a threat of more
							forceful action to come. They would not know which and this would
							increase their anxiety. The risk of loss is low. The North Koreans would
							resent but probably not publicize our intrusion into their air space
							unless they shot down a reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
                        <p>2. Sailing <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> along the North Korean coast
							with an escorting force demonstrates our right and our willingness to do
							what we were <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0620"/>doing when <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was seized. We believe the risk of North
							Korea seizing the Banner is zero; the risk of their attacking it with
							aircraft or missiles is low. The presence of the escorting force and the
							knowledge (or suspicion) that U.S. forces are prepared to react quickly
							to an attack on <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> would tend to deter such
							an attack and make the North Koreans apprehensive. Despite the escort,
							however, there is a risk of attack by aircraft or missiles with a
							possibility that <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi> would be sunk. Like the
							other courses of action listed, it does not offer much prospect of
							producing the return of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew, but it
							does increase the pressure and tension in the area.</p>
                        <p>3. The seizure of a North Korean naval vessel is more risky since it
							would probably be opposed by North Korean air and naval forces. It would
							be a dramatic demonstration of our concern and determination, but it
							would probably not greatly increase our bargaining power in obtaining
							release of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and crew; in fact it would
							probably reduce prospects of this. And unless we had exhausted the
							machinery of the United Nations, our action could be properly denounced
							as illegal.</p>
                        <p>If we wish to seize (or sink) a North Korean naval vessel, our best
							chance might come during a fracas resulting from enemy attempts to
							harass or sink <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi>.</p>
                        <p>4. A limited blockade of North Korean naval vessels would quickly become
							a “set-piece” operation on our part. North Korea could watch it,
							determine the pattern, and pick the time and place for offensive action.
							If they decided to do it, they could, almost certainly, sink an
							important US naval vessel, such as a destroyer. We stand to lose much
							more than we gain by undertaking actions which leave the initiative for
							counter-action to the enemy. There, in his own backyard, we cannot
							afford to maintain enough force to prevent a determined counter effort
							from succeeding. Even though we doubt that he would risk it, we
							shouldn't repeat the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident, on a larger
							scale, by giving him the option of striking us again at a vulnerable
							point.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Air Reconnaissance</hi>. Low key reconnaissance
							would be designed to achieve needed information and concurrently keep
							the opposition guessing as to our next move. This effort, limited to
							that reconnaissance which we really need, and which the enemy will think
							is compatible with a genuine military need, should be seriously
							considered. It should be of a nature designed to minimize the
							probability of loss.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sailing Banner</hi>. If we conclude that we must do
							something visible at this time, sailing of <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi>
							is probably as good as any other visible action.</p>
                        <p>If we do it, we should do it low profile, with little or no visible
							force. A combat air patrol should be a safe distance away, in order of
								<pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0621"/>50 miles, where it could
							intervene if required but where it would be less likely to create an
							incident. The surface escorts should be well over the horizon, clearly
							out of sight of any vessels approaching <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi>
							but able to intervene.</p>
                        <p>We shouldn't undertake the operation at all unless we were prepared for
							some significant consequences:</p>
                        <p>a. If North Korea sinks or seriously damages <hi rend="italic">Banner</hi>, we should be prepared to count this as an “Act of
							War.”</p>
                        <p>b. We should have plans in being, and have made a decision, in advance,
							to make a suitable military response to the sinking or serious damaging
							of <hi rend="italic"> Banner </hi>.</p>
                        <p>c. These plans should include such actions as neutralization of the North
							Korean Air Force.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Seizing a North Korean Naval Vessel</hi>. As the
							attached detailed planning indicates, this course is dangerous. We might
							fail; we might suffer heavier losses than the enemy in the process. We
							probably should not undertake this action unless we are looking for a
							small fight and wish to use this action to cause one.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Limited Blockade of North Korean Naval Vessels</hi>.
							This action is not recommended. It would be costly in resources, would
							be unlikely to help retrieve the ship and crew, and leaves the US
								vulnerable—<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> could pick the time and
							place and hope to sink a significant US vessel such as a destroyer. It
							is unlikely that North Korea would do this; however, if it happened, our
							legal position for retaliation would not be particularly good and we
							would have suffered another blow to our prestige.</p>

							relatively mild complaint at concentration our naval forces off Korea.

                        <p>2. I said since message addressed to President I wished make only two
							personal observations. First was that I understood our vessels were
							located off South and not North Korea and I understood Enterprise had
							never come within two hundred miles of Wonsan.<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> made a similar point
								during a discussion with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States,
									<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Anatoli F. Dobrynin</persName>,
								while the latter was in Moscow. He reported that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> expected that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crisis could be resolved provided that
								the United States “took no further action to increase tension” and
								warned that the “threat of force made Soviet intervention difficult
								and if force were actually used Soviet Union would have to react.”
									<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> also thought it
								unlikely that the North Koreans would settle the matter without
								demanding an apology from the United States. (Telegram 2672 from
								Moscow, February 3; ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Second was that I had pointed out to him before the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was not the only recent incident in this area and I
							mentioned specifically the thirty-one infiltrators who had attempted to
							kill the President of South Korea. Naturally this had made the South
							Koreans somewhat nervous.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said a hundred miles or
							so didn't change situation, there were mutual charges about incidents
							along <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and aircraft carriers were of

                        <p>5. I asked <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> if he had any

							report but understood our representatives had agreed to meet again.</p>

                        <p>The North Korean chief effort we think will be to use the alleged

                        </p>
                        <p>“At our meeting on February 2 your side made several statements. I now
							address myself to these.</p>
                        <p>You characterized the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> as an 'armed spy
							ship.' The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> is a commissioned ship of the
							US Navy. It carried three 50-caliber machine guns. These were kept
							covered. They were not fired when the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was
							being seized by North Korean patrol boats. We have made quite clear that
							the Pueblo was on an intelligence collection mission in the Sea of Japan
							at the time of its seizure by North Korea. Intelligence collection by
							vessels of this type is a standard and accepted practice in the world
							today. The USSR, for example, has intelligence collection vessels
							stationed at the present time off the coasts of many countries,
							including Korea. Are you suggesting that neighboring countries have a
							right to seize vessels of this kind?</p>
                        <p>At the meeting of February 2 you charged that the mission of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> constituted an 'act of aggression' by the
							United States. The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was engaged in a
							mission that is accepted by the navies and governments of the world, and
							it engaged in no hostilities against anyone, including North Korea. The
							carrying out of its mission on the high seas cannot possibly be
							characterized as an aggressive action. Are you suggesting that Soviet
							intelligence-collecting vessels on similar missions are engaged in acts
							of aggression?</p>
                        <p>You stated that the mission of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							constituted 'the most flagrant violation of the Armistice Agreement
							requiring the cessation of all hostile acts in Korea and respecting the
							waters, respecting the demilitarized zone and waters contiguous to the
							demilitarized zone and to this land.' The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							engaged in no hostilities at all. What <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0627"/>provision of the Armistice Agreement did the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> violate? Paragraph 12 of the Armistice
							Agreement provides that—</p>
                        <p>'The Commanders of the opposing sides shall order and enforce a complete
							cessation of all hostilities in Korea by all armed forces under their
							control, including all units and personnel of the ground, naval, and air
							forces, effective twelve (12) hours after this Armistice Agreement is
							signed.'</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was not engaged in hostilities. The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> reported it never uncovered its guns. It
							never offered any threat to anyone.</p>
                        <p>Your statement appeared to refer also to paragraph 15 of the Armistice
							Agreement, which reads as follows:</p>
                        <p>'This Armistice Agreement shall apply to all opposing naval forces, which
							naval forces shall respect the waters contiguous to the Demilitarized
							Zone and to the land area of Korea under the military control of the
							opposing side, and shall not engage in blockade of any kind of
							Korea.'</p>
                        <p>The expression 'the waters contiguous to the Demilitarized Zone and to
							the land area of Korea under the military control of the opposing side'
							could, under no interpretation, extend beyond 12 nautical miles from the
							coast.</p>
                        <p>I come now to the crucial question of where the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was.</p>
                        <p>You have said that the United States Government 'purposefully infiltrated
							your armed spy ship <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> into our territorial
							waters.' Your version of where the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was
							does not square with the facts as we know them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> had strict orders to remain at all
							times at a distance more than 13 nautical miles from the nearest point
							in North Korean territory, in order to avoid any possible incident. We
							have no reason to believe the orders were not obeyed.</p>
                        <p>Where was the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> on January 23, 1968? At 1000
							hours Korean Standard Time the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> reported
							its position as 39–24 N 127–59 <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>. Two
							hours later, when the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> had been circled and
							threatened by North Korean submarine chaser No. 35, her position was
							39–25.2 N 127–55 <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>. No. 35 radioed its
							position at exactly the same time (1200 hours) as 39–25 N 127–56 <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>. All these positions are more than 15
							nautical miles from the nearest point in North Korean territory, Ung Do
							Island.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> reported being boarded by North Korean
							personnel at 1345 hours. It radioed its position then as 39–25 N 127–54
								<gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>. Five minutes later North Korean
							submarine chaser No. 35 reported its position as 39–29 N 128–08 <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">After
								receiving an inquiry from the Embassy in Seoul concerning these
								coordinates, the Department of State issued a correction reading:
								“Five minutes later North Korean submarine chaser No. 35 reported
								its position as 39–26N and 128–02 <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>.
								At the same time it reported Pueblo's position as 39–23N and
								128–02E.” (Telegram 3911 from Seoul and telegram 109717 to Seoul,
								both February 3; ibid.)</note> These positions also are clearly more
							than 15 miles from the coast.</p>
                        <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0628"/>
                        <p>These are the facts as known to the United States: A commissioned warship
							of the US Navy, carrying out an accepted and legitimate mission, engaged
							in no hostilities, and offering threat to no one, was seized in
							international waters. As your side must be aware, the rule of
							international law is that warships on the high seas have complete
							immunity from the jurisdiction of any state other than the flag
							state.</p>
                        <p>Even in the case of a warship that has entered territorial waters, the
							coastal state is not entitled to assert any jurisdiction over it other
							than to require the warship to leave the territorial sea if the warship
							does not comply with regulations of the coastal state concerning passage
							through the territorial sea and disregards a request for compliance.</p>
                        <p>Let me emphasize here that this is the practice regularly followed by the
							United States. For example, the Soviet ship Barometer came within 2.8
							miles of Puerto Rico on April 7, 1965 while maneuvering to remain near
							US Naval forces. On October 23, 1965 the Soviet ship Arban entered US
							territorial waters off San Pedro, California. And again on December 6,
							1966 the Soviet ship Teodolit violated US territorial waters on three
							separate occasions. In each of these cases the United States observed
							the plain rules of international law in requesting departure of the ship
							in question without attempting to assert any other jurisdiction over
							it.</p>
                        <p>You have stated that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was within the
							territorial waters of North Korea. All our evidence shows that it was on
							the high seas. You have stated a right to seize a foreign war vessel
							within your territorial sea. We contend international law gives no such
							right. These are serious points of contention that should be resolved.
							Yet, they need not be resolved before the release of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew and the return of the vessel. We are
							seeking a peaceful settlement of this matter by direct negotiation
							through the established machinery of the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>. We ask for immediate release of the crew and return of
							the vessel.”</p>
                        <p>2. General Pak may then assert that obvious way to resolve this
							disagreement is for US to accept North Korea's version of facts. In
							support of this, he may surface alleged confession of Commander Bucher
							or other evidence (such as purported ship's log) for purpose of
							sustaining North Korea's allegation. You can meet this as follows:</p>
                        <p>“You have referred to an alleged confession from the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> [and other purported evidence].<note n="4" xml:id="d262fn4">Brackets in the source text.</note> Because this
							alleged evidence conflicts with the data available to our side, we
							cannot be expected to accept it unless it is verified by the captain and
							crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. Without the availability of
							Commander Bucher and his crew, <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0629"/>we would have no way of satisfying ourselves as to the value of what
							you present as evidence.</p>
                        <p>I can assure you that after the release of the crew and the vessel we
							will, of course, conduct an inquiry, and we will inform you of the
							results of that inquiry. If we find that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in fact in North Korea's territorial sea contrary
							to all our present information, we will be prepared so to acknowledge
							publicly and to express our regret.</p>
                        <p>Allegations made in this room as to the location of the ship will not
							resolve this disputed issue. Does your side have any proposals for a
							peaceful resolution of this issue? We are prepared to receive your
							proposal now or at our next meeting, which I propose to be held on
							February __.”<note n="5" xml:id="d262fn5">In reply the Embassy in Seoul
								recommended omitting any reference to a specific date for the next
								meeting. <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> explained
								that “normal <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> practice is not to
								set date for next session in current meeting, and in this instance
								next meeting would be dependent on when North Koreans prepared
								present their proposal.” The U.S. side could call the next meeting,

                        <p>1. Pak opened by referring to <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s prepared statements at previous meeting, saying
							that some points were not clear and that therefore he had a few
							questions.</p>
                        <p>2. His first question referred to <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s request for meeting in atmosphere free from
							compulsion (see Seoul 3890 for <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s exact words).<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">According to telegram 3890 from Seoul, February 2, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> said: “I have requested
								this meeting in order to discuss with you in an atmosphere free from
								compulsions created by publicity the very serious situation which
								results from the fact that you have possession of the United States
								Ship Pueblo and also its crew.” (Ibid.)</note> Deliberately using
							words “free from compulsion” out of context , <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0630"/>Pak stated that discussion would indeed
							have to be conducted in an atmosphere free from compulsion but that
							coercive atmosphere has been created by US side. He made point that US
							side had sent Pueblo into their territorial waters and had not
							apologized, but had instead threatened <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							by armed forces. Specifically, US had concentrated vessels of the
							Seventh Fleet, including nuclear-propelled carrier Enterprise, in
							vicinity <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territory. (Pak's interpreter
							said in English “in our territorial waters”; Pak's statement in Korean,
							however, differs from this version. We are carefully checking
								language.)<note n="3" xml:id="d263fn3">The verbatim text of the
								February 4 meeting quoted Pak as saying, “the nuclear-propelled
								carrier Enterprise in (toward) our territorial waters.” (Telegram
								3927 from Seoul, February 4; ibid.)</note> Pak referred also to
							introduction numerous fighters and bombers to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, issuance of standby orders to US troops and puppet
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army thereby keeping them in
							state of complete combat readiness.</p>
                        <p>Pak asked whether he could understand that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s reference to atmosphere free of compulsion
							implies that US will eliminate atmosphere of compulsion that it has
							created. Pak then referred to fact that at 261st <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting Jan 24 <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had failed to apologize for great criminal act and
							instead made a coercive statement demanding immediate return Pueblo and
							crew, and had reserved right to demand compensation.<note n="4" xml:id="d263fn4">The verbatim text of <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s remarks on January 24 was transmitted in
								telegram 3608 from Seoul, January 25. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 27–14 KOR/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>)</note> Pak asked whether he could understand that
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement at last
							meeting (Feb 2) implies that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> denounces these coercive statements.</p>
                        <p>3. Stating that he was making his second inquiry, Pak referred to fact
							that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had stated at Feb 2
							meeting that Pueblo not under command of CINCUNC, but was unit of US
							Pacific Fleet, and that Pueblo case was without precedent. Pak asked
							whether he could understand that this means case is to be dealt with as
							matter between two sides—<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and USA.
							He added that if this understanding is correct and US side appoints
							representative of USA, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side would also
							appoint representative of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Pak concluded his presentation by adding that if <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> not prepared to answer these
							questions now, “he may answer later.”</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> responded that
							questions Pak had posed contained many technical issues which <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> will refer to appropriate
							authorities for guidance.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> then stated that he had

							c. Paragraph dealing with position of Pueblo at time of boarding was
							changed to read as follows: “five minutes later the Pueblo reported
							being boarded by North Korean personnel at 1345 hours. Five minutes
							later North Korean submarine chaser no. 35, in company with the Pueblo,
							reported its position as 39–26 N, 128–02 <gloss target="#t_E1">E</gloss>, even farther from the nearest Korean land.”</p>
                        <p>7. Pak replied with standard language about futility of trying to explain
							away aggressive acts which have already been made clear. He then added
							that this case cannot be solved in this manner.</p>
                        <p>8. Indicating that he did not wish to discuss matter further, Pak stated
							that he had raised serious matters at this meeting and that if <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> will study seriously and
							provide answers, he would be prepared to hear them. He ended by
							remarking, “Let's conclude and meet later to have a talk.”</p>
                        <p>9. In response, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							again requested information regarding names of Pueblo dead and wounded,
							to which Pak responded that as he had stated at last meeting, he had not
							yet got any mission to inform <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> of them. He reiterated suggestion to meet again
							and have talk. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> then said
							“I agree” and meeting concluded.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I.</p>
                        <p>1. At the Second Meeting of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> and General Pak, the North Korean side put forward
							two principal demands:</p>
                        <p>a. The US should “eliminate the atmosphere of compulsion it has created”
							by concentrating Seventh Fleet and US air power in the vicinity of North
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>b. Since the Pueblo was not under CINCUNC, the matter of Pueblo's seizure
							should be dealt with on a government-to-government level, i.e. by
							representatives of the US and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea
								(<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>).</p>
                        <p rend="center">II. “Elimination of Compulsion”</p>
                        <p>2. The North Korean statement about eliminating the “atmosphere of
							compulsion” is clearly a demand for the withdrawal or reduction of our
							military buildup in the Korean area. It raises two kinds of
							questions:</p>
                        <p>a. What do we say at the next meeting?</p>
                        <p>b. Can we and should we agree to make any changes in the disposition of
							US forces in the area as a token of our “sincerity” and our desire to
							get down to business?</p>
                        <p>3. The first question is a matter of tactics for the next meeting. The
							second question is more fundamental.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What we Say</p>
                        <p>4. In raising this question General Pak has twisted Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s words at the first meeting of
							the Senior Members. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had referred to our desire for a meeting to
							discuss the Pueblo case in an “atmosphere free from the compulsion of
							publicity.” This distortion should be pointed out at the next meeting.
							It should then be emphasized that if there is an atmosphere of tension
							and a buildup of military forces in the area, it is because of
							increasingly aggressive acts by the North Korean armed forces such as
							the infiltration of spies and <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0633"/>saboteurs, the raid on the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							Presidential palace and finally the seizure of the Pueblo. If North
							Korea exercises restraint vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and if it releases the Pueblo and crew, tensions will
							be reduced, and the US will be able to draw appropriate conclusions and
							act accordingly.</p>
                        <p>5. At the next meeting also, we should repeat our request for the names
							of the dead and injured, suggesting that if the North Korean authorities
							are unwilling to make even this small and compassionate gesture they
							cannot be serious about reducing tensions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">What we Do</p>
                        <p>6. Meanwhile we should be considering what to do after the next meeting.
							Pak complained that the US has threatened North Korea by sending the
							Seventh Fleet (including specifically the Enterprise) into the vicinity
							of North Korean territory, by introducing “numerous fighters and
							bombers” into the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and by placing US
							troops and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army in a state of
							complete combat readiness.</p>
                        <p>The following actions should conceivably be taken to evidence our desire
							to get things moving:</p>
                        <p>a. Move Enterprise task group south to East China Sea.</p>
                        <p>b. Withdraw Enterprise and at least part of Enterprise task group from
							the area.</p>
                        <p>c. Move some or all of remaining naval units south.</p>
                        <p>d. Return some tactical air units from <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to Okinawa or Japan.</p>
                        <p>Our view is that the simplest and safest initial gesture would be moving
							Enterprise task group south. This movement would probably be made known
							almost immediately to the North Koreans by the USSR. Such movement could
							be made without operational difficulty and without placing our forces
							too far away to be useful or threatening. Such moves would be less
							visible to the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> and easier to
							explain than withdrawal of air units from the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> or a standdown of the Eighth US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armies.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">When to Do It</p>
                        <p>7. The main question is whether to make a gesture of withdrawal in the
							current phase, i.e. while the North Koreans are still building their
							case, releasing confessions and stating conditions, or to wait until
							they have put everything on the table, the issues are further
							crystallized, and some action may be needed to break a deadlock and
							prevent negotiations from coming to a stop.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>Issue orders to the Enterprise task group to begin steaming south but
							delay execution of the orders until after the next meeting, when a final
							decision on this action would be taken.</p>
                        <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0634"/>
                        <p>III. Raising the Level of Negotiations</p>
                        <p>8. At the February 4 meeting General Pak referred to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement (at the February 2
							meeting): “and additionally the ship was not under the
							Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command.” Pak asked whether
							this meant that the case is to be dealt with as a matter between the two
							sides—the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and USA; if this
							understanding is correct and the US side appoints a representative of
							the USA, the North Korean side would also appoint a representative of
							the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. The North Koreans appear to have picked up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command point in order to make a bid to raise the level
							of discussion on the Pueblo to government-to-government. In addition to
							the general objections we would have to any such shift, it would pose
							two special problems with the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>:<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">In telegram 3973 from
								Seoul, February 5, the Embassy reported growing dissatisfaction with
								the U.S.-North Korean meetings at Panmunjom within the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. National Assembly leaders and
								political spokesmen saw the secret talks as an affront to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and an infringement of its
								sovereignty and complained that President Pak was not informed about
								the meetings in advance. In an editorial, the government-owned
								newspaper Sinmun portrayed the negotiations as “'tantamount to
								betrayal' of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> since it not
								consulted in advance and because North Koreans treated as equal.”
								The article repeated President Pak's comment that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> did not have unlimited patience in
								dealing with North Korea, called for a withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops from Vietnam, recommended
								the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> regain operational control
								of its military, and “urged <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to
								take independent retaliatory action, if necessary.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. The issue of recognition and status for Pyongyang.</p>
                        <p>b. Separation out of the Pueblo seizure to be dealt with on a higher
							level than the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>, to which the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s problems are relegated.</p>
                        <p>10. We believe that at the next meeting in Panmunjom Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should clarify his statement to
							assert that while in the US military command structure the Pueblo was
							not under CINCUNC, it was nevertheless part of the forces in the area of
							the United States, it was there in pursuance of the efforts of the
							CINCUNC to maintain peace, and it is the United States which provides
							the unified command of United Nations forces for Korea pursuant to the
							United Nations Security Council resolution of July 7, 1950. Admiral
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> would then go on to
							say that he, as Senior Member of the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>
							on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command side, represented the
							United States Government fully in regard to matters involving military
							forces related to peace and security in Korea. He would also recall the
							position taken by the North Korean side that the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> was the appropriate forum for discussing the Pueblo
							seizure. A suggested statement is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d264fn3">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>11. The North Koreans might nevertheless persist in its demand for
							appointment of government-level representatives to deal with the Pueblo.
							If they should, we would then have to consider whether we would want to
							meet them part way on this issue by a device such as (a) giving Admiral
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> another hat as
							special US representative, or (b) sending an additional US Government
							representative to Panmunjom to sit with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> and take part in discussion on
							the Pueblo; any such representative should be auxiliary to Admiral
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> and not independent
							of him, and the talks should remain in the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> framework at Panmunjom. (In this connection, you may be
							aware of <persName corresp="#p_GAJ1">Arthur Goldberg</persName>'s
							suggestion, made yesterday, that a lawyer be sent from Washington to
							work with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> and
							assist him in the discussions.)</p>
                        <p rend="center">IV. Tactics</p>
                        <p>12. The failure of the North Koreans to provide the names of our injured
							and dead at this second meeting should be hit hard at the next meeting.
							We have asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> to
							put in a request through the Joint Duty Officer immediately, and also to
							consider using the good offices of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members in their private capacities in view of their
							offer to do this if we failed to obtain any information at the first
							meeting.</p>
                        <p>13. If we have not received an answer before the third meeting, Admiral
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should open with an
							insistent demand for their names as a token of their good faith in these
							negotiations. They have, in effect, asked us for the withdrawal of the
							Enterprise as a token of our good faith. If they are not prepared to
							make the simple gesture, we certainly should not make the very visible
							larger one.</p>
                        <p>14. This second meeting is rather ominous, and we should consider sending
							the letter to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> if we are
							still on dead center after the third. The letter would say that we have
							gotten nowhere in these meetings. The North Koreans whose activities
							produced the present state of tension continue to say it is we who are
							threatening. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> has asked
							for restraint. We have exercised restraint. As a further gesture, and
							depending on how we assess the third meeting, we might tell him we are
							moving the Enterprise south.</p>
                        <p>15. It is our turn to ask for the next meeting. If we are ready with our
							instructions by 5:00 p.m. today (7:00 a.m. Monday, Korea time), we could
							ask for the meeting for 4:00 p.m. Monday, Korea time. The North Koreans
							would then either have to accept or propose a later time, hopefully
							Tuesday.</p>

                        <p>1. Following are texts of statements recommended for use by Admiral
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> at next meeting of
							Senior members.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should open
							with statement as follows on North Korean accusation that we have
							created atmosphere of compulsion:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin Verbatim Text:</p>
                        <p>a. At the last meeting you said that the release of the crew and vessel
							Pueblo should be discussed in an atmosphere free from compulsion. Let me
							repeat that the US Government seeks a peaceful solution of this matter.
							You have stated that our side has created an “atmosphere of compulsion.”
							Admittedly, there is an atmosphere of tension in this area, but that
							atmosphere is related to actions by North Korea. Account must be taken
							of increasingly aggressive actions by North Korean armed forces such as
							the infiltration of spies and saboteurs across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> over the last 14 months, the raid on
							the Presidential palace in Seoul, and finally the seizure of the
							Pueblo.</p>
                        <p>b. There is, therefore, a direct way to reduce tensions and eliminate the
							“atmosphere of compulsion” to which you refer. The armistice agreement
							must be faithfully observed. The North Korean Government should release
							immediately the Pueblo and its crew. Tensions would be reduced and the
							United States would be able to draw the correct conclusions. End
							Verbatim Text.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should then repeat
							demand for names of dead and wounded if they have not already been
							given. We simply cannot understand why the North Korean side persists in
							refusing simple humanitarian request of this nature. Refusal without
							reason aggravates tensions.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to North Korean effort to get us to put discussions on
							govt-to-govt level, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							should use following carefully prepared language:</p>
                        <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0637"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin Verbatim Text:</p>
                        <p>a. General Pak at the meeting of February 4 referred to my earlier
							statement that the Pueblo was not under the command of CINCUNC, that it
							was a unit of the US Pacific Fleet, and that the case was without
							precedent.</p>
                        <p>b. First, let me recall what I actually said on the question of
							precedent. These were my words: “The action of North Korea in seizing
							the ship was completely without precedent, and it was illegal because
							the ship was in international waters, …”</p>
                        <p>c. Obviously, I was referring to the fact that seizure of a warship in
							peacetime in international waters, in contravention of international law
							and accepted international practice, is quite unprecedented.</p>
                        <p>d. Next, let me clarify the place of the Pueblo in the US military
							command structure. I stated that the vessel was not under the command of
							CINCUNC because the line of command for the vessel ran from the US naval
							command in the Pacific rather than through CINCUNC. The Pueblo was, of
							course, a commissioned ship of the United States Navy, and as such a
							part of the armed forces of the United States. The need for the Pueblo's
							presence in the Sea of Japan arose from increased tensions in Korea
							caused by the actions of your side, and was in support of the mission of
							the forces on our side which is to maintain peace and security in the
							area.</p>
                        <p>e. As for my position as Senior Member of the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> on our side, I am here as the representative of the
							United States Government and authorized by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to discuss Pueblo matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d265fn3">In telegram 109876 to Seoul, February 5, the following was
								substituted for this paragraph: “As for my position, I am the Senior
								Member of the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> on our side and I
								represent the United States Government with full authority to
								discuss the release of the U.S.S. Pueblo and its crew.” The Senior
								Member was instructed to make clear his position as representing,
								but not as a representative of, the U.S. Government in this matter.
								(Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>f. Finally, your side has already recognized that the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> machinery is appropriate for discussion
							of the Pueblo seizure. Your side has done so in the statements of
							spokesmen and in the action of holding the meetings we have had.
							Accordingly, we do not see what special representatives could do in
							these discussions that you and I cannot do. If your side has anything
							specific in mind, would you elaborate? End Verbatim Text.<note n="4" xml:id="d265fn4">In telegram 109856 to Seoul, February 4, the

								<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>

                        <p>1. RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> opened meeting by
							reading verbatim text of statement contained para 2, State 109854,<note n="3" xml:id="d267fn3">
                                <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> concerning atmosphere
							of compulsion. Before reading his statement, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> passed to Pak two copies in
							both English and Korean. Pak and his advisor read statements intently
							while <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> was speaking.</p>
                        <p>2. Pak, reading from prepared statement, responded that at Feb 4 meeting
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had given explanation
							distorting facts to make it appear that Pueblo had been in international
							waters and crew had committed no crime. Said charge <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had just made had nothing to do
							with Pueblo matter and reserved right to express position in future.
							Referring again to his Feb 4 statement about compulsive atmosphere
							having been created by US side, Pak advised <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> to answer later after seriously
							studying his statement. He then requested answer to his second question
							at Feb 4 meeting (whether case was to be dealt with as matter between
								<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and USA, since <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had stated Pueblo not under UNC
							command and case was without precedent).</p>
                        <p>3. Smith responded by again requesting names of Pueblo crew who are dead
							and wounded.</p>
                        <p>4. Pak, again reading prepared statement, contended that purpose of these
							contacts is to arrange means of discussing matters related to Pueblo
							case. Said that if <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> wished
							to solve matter “practically”, it proper that representative from both
							sides appointed by <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and US should
							meet among themselves. He again requested clear answer to his question
							in Feb 4 meeting in this connection.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>, saying he would
							address that subject shortly, then read prepared statement referring to
							fact that he had requested info on names of Pueblo dead and wounded by
							written and oral means without result, ending with statement that US
							simply cannot understand why <pb n="608" xml:id="pg_608" facs="0640"/>

							humanitarian requests of this nature; such refusal, without reason,
							aggravates tensions.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>, stating he was
							responding to Pak's second question at Feb 4 meeting, read verbatim text
							of statement contained para 4, State 109854, as amended by State
								109876.<note n="4" xml:id="d267fn4">See <ref target="#d265fn3">footnote 3, Document 265</ref>.</note> As with first statement,
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> provided Pak copies
							in English and Korean, which were again avidly read.</p>
                        <p>7. Pak replied after long lapse, during which he made extensive penciled
							changes in his prepared text and combined latter with notes he had made
							on written copy of <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s
							statement. He said that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							in his last statement had stated he represents Govt of US in handling
							Pueblo case. Asked whether he could understand that US side admits
							Pueblo case is matter to be handled by <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and US and that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> represents US Govt.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> rejoined that he did
							not feel he could improve on statement he had just read, which prepared
							by US Govt.</p>
                        <p>9. Pak, after deleting several lines and making brief addition to
							prepared statement, said he noted “your acknowledgment” that Pueblo case
							is matter to be handled by <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and by
							US Govt and that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							represents US Govt. Asked whether <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> agreed with this understanding. (Foregoing was
							spoken very slowly and deliberately by interpreter.)</p>
                        <p>10. After repeating statement about his inability to improve on words
							given him by US Govt, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							stated that “I will agree that I am acting for US Govt.” After reviewing
							his statement, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> added that
							he saw nothing in statement which states that US Govt will deal directly
							with <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> as such.</p>
                        <p>11. Pak responded with notation of fact that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had stated he represents US
							Govt with full authority to deal with Pueblo case. He suggested
							conclusion this meeting and “Let's have a talk when we meet again.”</p>
                        <p>12. Smith said that before concluding he wished make additional point. He
							then read prepared statement containing suggestion that future meetings
							be held at 1400 hrs (as suggested State 109852).<note n="5" xml:id="d267fn5">Dated February 4. (National Archives and Records

							said he had given Pak replies to his questions of previous day, that he
							had nothing further, would await Pak's reply, and suggested recess. Pak
							stated he noted what <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had
							said. Meeting recessed at 1631 hrs.</p>

                        <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Meeting was very businesslike. Pak
							was obviously unhappy over what <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> said but remained polite. Obvious that his

								<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
                        <p>I can tell you very simply why additional U.S. military forces are in the
							area of South Korea and the Sea of Japan.<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">With the exception of this sentence, this and the following two
								paragraphs of the letter were sent to Porter, who was instructed to
								read the text to Pak alone and to stress that the information was
								being passed in strictest confidence. (Telegram 110350 to Seoul,
								February 6; ibid.)</note> For many months infiltration from North
							Korea across the Demilitarized Zone has been increasing. There were
							about 50 incidents initiated by the North Koreans in 1966; there were
							almost 600 in 1967. We have reports that there were some who were trying
							to persuade North Korea to open a so-called second front. <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0642"/>We are fully aware of the threatening
							public statements made by the leaders of North Korea themselves,
							including the recent statement by Premier <persName corresp="#p_KIS1">Kim Il-sung</persName> that— 'We must accomplish the South Korean
							revolution, unify the fatherland in our generation, and hand down a
							unified fatherland to the coming generations. We must quickly make all
							conditions ripe for the realization of the unification of the
							fatherland.'</p>
                        <p>Recently two events occurred within a few days of each other which we
							were forced to take with the utmost seriousness. A North Korean mission
							of specially trained officers was intercepted in Seoul with orders to
							assassinate President Park, the American Ambassador, and their families.
							Second, a vessel of the U.S. Navy was seized in international waters in
							an action which is almost literally without precedent in modern times
							and which violated a rule of law in which you and all other maritime
							nations have a great interest. This act has deeply stirred and outraged
							the American people. Surely you need not look beyond these developments
							to understand why we felt it necessary to augment our forces.</p>
                        <p>Quite frankly, we do not know what North Korea has in mind. We do know
							what we have in mind; namely, that North Korea will not be permitted to
							direct its military forces against South Korea and that American flag
							vessels are not to be seized on the high seas.</p>
                        <p>As far as the Pueblo matter is concerned, you and I seem to agree that a
							prompt settlement is in the common interest. This can only mean, of
							course, the prompt return of the Pueblo and its crew. We see no reason
							why this action could not be taken within the next two or three days
							through the channels now established at Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>If the ship and its crew are promptly returned, it is obvious that
							tension in the Korean area would be sharply reduced and the forces there
							could then assume a more normal posture. We must, of course, continue to
							watch and take seriously any continued acts of infiltration directed
							against the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to have your candid views. On the assumption that you and I
							agree that we want peace in that area and that we will both work to that
							end, I can tell you that I have directed that there be no further
							build-up of our air and naval forces at this time. In addition, I am
							directing one of our aircraft carriers and accompanying vessels to move
							somewhat southward.</p>

                        <p>1. I delivered the President's message to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> at 3 p.m. today.</p>
                        <p>2. Upon hearing translation of message, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asked me to convey his thanks to President. At
							same time he wanted me to tell President that it was difficult for him
							to understand this situation. When a vessel got into territorial waters
							of other nations, matter should be resolved in accordance normal
							procedures. As US itself had said, Soviet vessels, although admittedly
							they were fishing vessels, had intruded in US territorial waters. US had
							seized vessels, put captains to trial, and levied fines which USSR then
							paid. Similar incidents had taken place in Norwegian territorial waters,
							but Soviets again used diplomatic channels, apologized, paid fine and
							settled matter. In no instance had the Soviets dispatched their naval
							vessels although, in case of Norway, there was powerful Soviet surface
							and submarine fleet in vicinity. In every instance Soviets had sought
							settle incidents through diplomatic channels without raising tensions
							and without creating possibility of conflict. On other hand, US reacted
							to Pueblo seizure by dispatching aircraft carriers and other vessels,
							which indicated that there were many hotheads in Pentagon who needed
							tranquilizers. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said time
							had passed when threats worked or when great powers could simply flick
							their fingers and have smaller nations do what they wanted them to do.
							It was in desire to put Pueblo incident in proper perspective that he
							had said in New Delhi that this was local conflict which should be
							settled by two parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>3. Referring to President's mention of infiltration, <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> asserted infiltration going in
							both directions and merely reflected natural desire Korean people for
							reunification their divided country. If US were divided, we would also
							have infiltration in both directions. In any event, area was close to
							Soviet territory and Soviet Union could not but be concerned about
							increased tensions and possibility of incidents there. He reiterated
							that it better to work through diplomatic channels through exchange of
							messages, etc., and not to resort to show of force.</p>
                        <p>4. This connection he noted Soviets had not dispatched their fleet when
							recently US destroyer collided with Soviet merchant vessel. In <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0644"/>this case too, US decided not
							even to apologize but rather to argue that Soviet vessel was at fault.
							At sea, there were certain rules to be abided by and if they were
							violated, apology was in order. Fortunately, Soviet vessel was damaged
							above rather than below water line, otherwise it would have sunk.</p>
                        <p>5. I pointed out we had delivered a note to MFA yesterday in which we
							described circumstances of collision and indicated fact that our
							destroyer had right of way under international regulations. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> countered by asserting our case
							not convincing and we simply trying protect our captain by stretching
							the truth. Soviets dealt with their captains committing similar
							violations quite differently: they demoted them and deprived them of
							ship command.</p>
                        <p>6. Reverting to Pueblo incident, I pointed out that while incident cited
							by Kosygin involved Soviet fishing vessels, Pueblo was a naval vessel.
							There was difference between procedures for handling fishing vessels and
							those regarding naval ships. There had been cases where Soviet naval
							vessels intruded in US territorial waters, but we merely asked them to
							leave and did not seize them. As Kosygin knew, our position was that
							Pueblo had been seized in international waters. However, even if it had
							intruded into North Korean territorial waters, proper procedure should
							have been to ask it to leave rather than seize it. I then pointed out
							that coincidence of recent events in Korea, such as North Korean plan
							for assassination of President Park and our Ambassador and Pueblo
							seizure, created great concern among South Koreans who did not know what
							to expect next from North Korea. I also pointed out that we were trying
							to use diplomatic means to secure release of Pueblo and its crew, and
							expressed hope that meetings at Panmunjom would soon bear fruit.</p>
                        <p>5. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said he thought discussions at Panmunjom were
							proceeding normally and should be continued. Direct US-North Korean
							talks much more useful than intercession by third party. He felt that
							Panmunjom meetings apparently gave some satisfaction to both US and
							North Korea.</p>
                        <p>6. When I reiterated my hope for prompt successful outcome those talks,
								<persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> said Soviets also
							interested in prompt settlement of incident since there were enough
							conflicts in world already and there was no need to have a new one.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> then raised Middle East
							and Vietnam, which reported separately. At end of meeting I asked him
							what he proposed to give to press about our meeting. He said that, as
							last time, he would issue statement that he had met with me at my own
							request, with no indication of subjects discussed.</p>

							complete this report we're making this morning, finish preparation of
							it. I went over it with Bob and with Dean<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert McNamara</persName> and Dean

							and we're classifying it very highly, so it will be in the nature of a
							report to you, and we're also putting a special classification on it to
							keep it quite secret, so that you can use it as you want. But, on the
							whole, I think that we've come out with an agreed report that indicates
							that we ought to perform these missions in a somewhat different fashion
							in the future, that we probably shouldn't send them into waters of this
							kind without protection, and so forth. I wondered if you would like me
							to come over for five or ten minutes and just run through it before we
							finally put it to bed.</p>
                        <p>President: I sure would. I had two folks that I kind of wanted to—'cause
							they'll have to live with it some—to talk to you before you all really
							got it down finally, because I'm afraid that it'll be like the Gaither
								Report,<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">The Gaither Report, which
								examined U.S. defense capabilities to respond to a surprise nuclear

                        <p>President: —because they had gone out and done a lot of things for us.
							They'll both be here. Max is testifying from time to time. He was on the

								<persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clark</persName> is chairman of it, and

							'em I'd like to have a little reaction from them <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0646"/>and any suggestions they have, because
								Rivers<note n="4" xml:id="d270fn4">Representative Mendel L. Rivers,

                        </list>
                        <p>In a meeting with the President by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName> and
								<persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>, it was agreed that
								<persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would endeavor to obtain
							agreement from his colleagues on his committee for him alone to make an
							oral report of the principal findings to the President. He would avoid
							policy recommendations, limiting his comments to the specifics of the
							Pueblo incident.</p>
                        <p>In the written draft report,<note n="2" xml:id="d271fn2">A copy of the
								sixth and presumably the final draft of the committee's report,
								February 7, is in the Johnson Library, National Security File,
								Intelligence File, Pueblo, January 1968.</note> the following points
							are made:</p>
                        <p>a. It would probably be wise to abandon efforts to conduct covert ELINT
							collection activities at sea. If this attempt were abandoned, then it
							would be possible to operate ELINT ships without radio silence and to
							protect a ship by an armed naval vessel further out to sea.</p>
                        <p>b. The government should review the sensitivity of coastal areas of ELINT
							interest before dispatching Pueblo-type ships on new missions.</p>
                        <p>c. There should be adequate destruction devices aboard ELINT ships to
							assure quick destruction in times of emergency.</p>
                        <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0647"/>
                        <p>d. Instructions to the skippers should be reviewed. Apparently there is
							an ambiguity in the instructions regarding the use of weapons in
							self-defense.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is to pull in all copies of
							his draft report from other members of the committee. We will decide at
							the next meeting with the President (probably toward the end of next
							week) what kind of public statement to make upon query with regard to
							the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Committee report. Some
							such statement as the following seems to be contemplated:</p>
                        <p>“The <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Committee has filed an
							oral report which emphasizes the complexities and technical character of
							many of the matters raised by the Pueblo incident and points out that
							committee has not been able to explore all these matters in depth in the
							time available to it. Hence, the report to the President limited itself
							to suggestions of certain areas which require further examination in
							order to determine appropriate action by the responsible governmental
							agencies. It took note of the fact that the President's Foreign
							Intelligence Advisory Board is already seized with certain aspects of
							the Pueblo incident and that the Eaton Board is in the course of making
							a thorough study of the many kinds of intelligence activities in which
							the Pueblo was engaged at the time of the incident.</p>
                        <p>“The President expressed his appreciation to the members of the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> Committee for their help and for
							the effectiveness of their work in the relatively short time available
							to them.”</p>
                        <p>At the next meeting of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the
							Pueblo matter will be given top priority. The principal question will be
							the scope of any study of the Pueblo incident which is within the
							capability of the Intelligence Board.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The North Korean stand at the Fourth Meeting is unpromising for an
							early settlement and could further complicate our relations with the
							Republic of Korea.<note n="2" xml:id="d272fn2">The Embassy did not send
								a summary of the fourth Senior Members meeting, since it lasted only
								26 minutes, but noted that the “meeting was again businesslike” and
								“Pak's manner was cooperative and polite.” (Telegram 4047 from
								Seoul, February 7; ibid.) A verbatim text of the meeting was
								forwarded in telegram 4051 from Seoul, February 7, and corrections
								based on an analysis of the Korean-language tape recording of the
								meeting are in telegram 4058 from Seoul, February 7. (Both
								ibid.)</note> The North Korean requests for the addition of a
							deputy, the exchange of minutes and more formalized procedures,
							including press releases, seem to have the following purposes:</p>
                        <p>a. To establish even more clearly that we have moved to
							government-to-government negotiations for prestige purposes.</p>
                        <p>b. To spin out the negotiations on the assumption they can do so with
							impunity, and to inhibit us from taking more forceful action while the
							talks continue.</p>
                        <p>c. To increase the existing strains on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-US relations, for the very idea of
							government-to-government talks, and especially without them, is anathema
							to South Korea. The North Koreans perhaps hope that these strains might
							become so acute as to produce street demonstrations in Seoul, and
							growing public resentment that would lead the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to withdraw some of its forces from Viet-Nam, or at
							least keep them from sending additional troops.</p>
                        <p>d. To keep the situation sufficiently unsettled and roiled as to keep US
							forces pinned down in the area. The North Koreans know, of course, about
							our foreign exchange problems, budgetary deficit, and the President's
							domestic difficulties, and it may be they think maintaining a certain
							amount of tension in Korea will put added strains on our resources and
							add to the President's troubles at home.</p>
                        <p>2. The request for a change in procedure, per se, presents no great
							problem for us, and we could accept it were it not for the strong
							[South] Korean reaction. However, we need not make a decision on this
							request for another meeting or two. By then, the news of the additional
							$100 million in military assistance will be public, and this might help
							moderate Korean feelings about these talks.</p>
                        <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0649"/>
                        <p>3. Probably the most significant sentence of the Fourth Meeting is: “You
							will be able to express your opinion at the next meeting on the
							disposition of the case of your armed spy ship Pueblo.” This is a clear
							indication that they expect us to table some specific proposal.</p>
                        <p>4. At the next meeting we should state again that we agree with them that
							a situation of acute tension, of which they complain, exists in the
							area, and it will not be reduced until:</p>
                        <p>a. The crew and vessel are released.</p>
                        <p>b. The provocations against the ROK stop.</p>
                        <p>5. We should stress that no amount of talk in this forum, or any other
							forum, is going to produce agreement on the facts.</p>
                        <p>6. We therefore see no special need for a new procedure. The North
							Koreans should be asked what the new procedure can do that can't be done
							under existing arrangements.</p>
                        <p>7. We should at the next meeting say we are ready at that meeting to
							table proposals for the disposal of the case. If this is a true
							negotiation they should table their proposal for disposal of the case at
							the same time. Are they prepared to table? If not, will they table
							theirs at the next meeting?</p>
                        <p>8. We have two proposals we can make:</p>
                        <p>a. We might state that we are prepared to submit the Pueblo issue to an
							international fact-finding body provided they agree to release the crew
							and vessel to us in connection with such an inquiry. This will give them
							something to chew on and smoke them out on this course of action. They
							are not likely to agree since they say the issue should be settled in
							direct talks.<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">The instructions sent to
								Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> in
								preparation for the fifth meeting reflected this proposal. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> was also instructed to
								inform the North Koreans that the United States had no objections to

                        </p>
                        <p>b. Our second proposal is to provide them with the following signed
							statement and assurance when the men and the vessel are released to
								us:<note n="4" xml:id="d272fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> also received

                        </dateline>
                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>I have been speculating with the members of my staff most directly
							concerned with the Korea problem. We have been looking beyond the
							present situation to the possible failure of Panmunjom or its endless
							stringing out.</p>
                        <p>We are conscious of the following weaknesses in all the forms of action
							which have been proposed:</p>
                        <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>—The Soviets have committed a high proportion of their Far East fleet to
							the area. They will feel their prestige is on the line if we move in on
							North Korean ports or attack North Korean installations with our air or
							naval power.</p>
                        <p>—but equally, in our message to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> we have indicated that time was relatively short
							before some form of action might have to be taken. Nothing would damage
							our credibility with the Russians more than if, having put forces in the
							area and stated to <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> the
							urgency of the matter, we did nothing.</p>
                        <p>—it is true we can pick up some North Korean-Polish ships; but they turn
							out to be almost wholly Polish. Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> is worried about possible pressure on the road to
							Berlin if we fuss with Polish transport, although I don't think the
							Poles want a Berlin crisis at the moment. But you should know that
							Gronouski, when sounded out, said in effect: Please don't.</p>
                        <p>—we don't have any firm fix on the possibility of a Free World denial of
							shipping and bunkerage in trade to North Korea, but it doesn't look like
							a very substantial measure.</p>
                        <p>In the face of these thin prospects and our desire to avoid a second
							front in Korea—at least at our initiation—the following thought has
							arisen: that we now mine the Haiphong and other harbors of North Viet
							Nam. The advantages are:</p>
                        <p>—even if not a decisive action, it is an important action which bears
							upon the major battle we are fighting;</p>
                        <p>—the Russian capacity to deal with it, and the Russian commitment to deal
							with it on a military basis is much less than something done in the Sea
							of Japan;</p>
                        <p>—it would maintain our credibility with <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> &amp; Company, especially if timed in
							relation to the indication in the letter concerning the Pueblo.</p>
                        <p>If we wish to institute the policy by increments, we could start by
							laying mine barriers in the south of North Viet Nam and progressively
							but swiftly moving north, perhaps using a back channel to suggest to
							Moscow that if they wish to have the mining stop short of Haiphong, they
							had better deliver the Pueblo and its crew.<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">The wisdom of saying anything to Moscow—even back-channel—would
								have to be checked. [Handwritten footnote in the source
								text.]</note> But it is a course which, once embarked upon, we would
							have to mean.</p>
                        <p>As for the men and the crew, we could continue being just as patient in
							the Panmunjom negotiations as the other side; but we would have to
							accept as likely that we would not get them back for some considerable
							period of time.</p>
                        <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0652"/>
                        <p>I am not recommending this course of action; but I believe it deserves
							careful thought if in fact the North Koreans and the Soviets are going
							to play this game out to extract humiliation of us.</p>

							Meeting Feb 10.</p>
                        <p>1. Since meeting was so short and consisted largely of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s reading of verbatim text, we

							language personnel examine it carefully and make any necessary
								revisions.<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">A verbatim text of the

                        <p>2. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> opened meeting
							by reading verbatim text of statement contained State 111812<note n="3" xml:id="d274fn3">See <ref target="#d272fn3">footnote 3, Document

                        </p>
                        <p>3. Although Pak was probably only prepared to receive <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s response to his proposals
							regarding future conduct of business through formal meetings, he also
							noted without objection that portion of <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement which presented our view on
							disposition of Pueblo case. He then immediately proposed recess and
							formal meeting next time.</p>
                        <p>4. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> countered with
							request for response to two questions contained at end of his
								statement.<note n="5" xml:id="d274fn5">As reported in telegram 4137,
									<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> asked: “Are you
								prepared today to state your side's readiness to return the crew and
								vessel? If you are not prepared today, will you be prepared at the
								next meeting to state that you will release the crew and
								vessel?”</note> Pak replied that his side would express its position
							at formal meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0653"/>
                        <p>5. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>, bearing in
							mind fact that <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> conference room
							where this and previous meetings have been held is small and that
							additional personnel will attend formal meetings, asked Pak where he
							proposed that formal meetings be held. Judging from his reaction, Pak
							misinterpreted this question and apparently thought <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had in mind holding meeting
							somewhere outside Panmunjom. He became flustered, consulted with KPA/CPV
							Assistant <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> Secretary who wrote out
							reply for him, and answered in manner betraying some anxiety that it his
							understanding both sides had already reached agreement that meetings
							will be held in <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> conference room at
							Panmunjom. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> concurred.</p>
                        <p>6. Pak agreed with <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s
							assumption that he would propose next meeting. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> then proposed recess. Pak
							agreed.</p>
                        <p>7. Meeting recessed at 1413 hours local. At precisely that time KPA/CPV
								<gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss> was receiving <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s request for open <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting Feb 12 to discuss tension
							resulting from armistice violations in and through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.<note n="6" xml:id="d274fn6">A summary

                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Comments:</hi> During this meeting Pak parried

								and instructed that the request not be made at the next meeting,
								“since we do not want give North Koreans impression that we expect
								anything less than immediate release of entire crew and ship.” The

								would be raised at a subsequent meeting or through the <gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss>. (Telegram 113551 to Seoul,

                        </p>
                        <p>9. Pak did not go back to question of <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s precise status in future formal meetings or
							refer again to point that two sides should be <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and USA.</p>
                        <p>10. Attendees feel that Pak was more polite, soft-spoken and cooperative
							than in previous closed meetings, albeit no more willing to concede or
							offer anything. Moreover, he was not aware during this meeting of our
							request for open <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting, and we
							therefore have no basis for judgment as to how he will react to this
							request or what effect it will have on order and timing of subsequent
							meetings.</p>

                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>: The report on a

                        </list>
                        <p>The sixth closed meeting of Senior Representatives was held yesterday
							afternoon at two o'clock Korean time and lasted twenty-two minutes. The
							whole meeting was devoted to presentation of the North Korean position
							on the Pueblo case.<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">The meeting took place
								on February 15 in Korea. A summary of the meeting was transmitted in
								telegram 4262 from Seoul, February 15; the verbatim text in telegram
								4261 from Seoul, February 15. (Both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The North Korean representative sharply attacked our version of both the
							facts and law bearing on the case. He made the following principal
							points:</p>
                        <p>a. The intrusion of the Pueblo into North Korean territorial waters is
							proved by confessions of the crew, the ship's log and navigational plot,
							and by “other material evidence, including intelligence data.”</p>
                        <p>b. When challenged by North Korean patrol craft, the Pueblo attempted to
							escape “while committing provocative firings.” The North Korean vessels
							returned fire in “self-defense.” (This charge was first made at the
							January 24 open <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting.)</p>
                        <p>c. The Geneva Convention of 1958 concerning territorial waters refers to
							“violations of order in navigation” and cannot be applied to “the case
							of an armed spy ship.” (We are not clear what the former phrase means.
							Possibly navigational error.)</p>
                        <p>d. The US side has signed treaties recognizing “the inviolability of
							territory of states.” The North Koreans were therefore fully justified
							in seizing the Pueblo.</p>
                        <p>The concluding North Korean statement apparently indicates their terms
							for the release of the crew of the Pueblo. The word “vessel” is
							significantly omitted.</p>
                        <p>“Therefore, we will give considerations to (will be able to consider) the
							issue of returning the crew members only when your side apologizes for
							the fact that the US Government dispatched the armed spy ship Pueblo to
							the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
							conducted espionage activities and perpetrated hostile acts, assuring
							(and assure) that it will not commit such criminal acts again.”</p>
                        <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0657"/>
                        <p>It is the US turn to set the date of the next closed meeting. We believe
							that we should call for such a meeting as soon as possible. We will
							prepare an instruction for Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> and seek clearance on it by 6:00 p.m. today (8:00
							a.m. February 16, Korean time), which will enable us to ask for a
							meeting the afternoon of February 16. In this instruction we will
							provide answers to the major points raised by the North Korean side and
							focus particularly on language that deals with “apologies” and
							“assurance” not to violate territorial waters.<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">Instructions for Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> for the seventh closed
								meeting were transmitted in telegram 116188 to Seoul, February 15,
								and modified in telegrams 116350 and 116402 to Seoul, both February
								16. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> was instructed to
								repeat the U.S. proposal “to conduct a full and impartial inquiry”
								after the ship and crew have been released, “to express regrets if
								any facts revealed by this inquiry would justify our doing so,” and
								to assure that all U.S. naval ships would “remain more than twelve
								nautical miles from your coast.” (All ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We will also prepare a message to Seoul giving Seoul the text of the
							Pueblo's Sailing Order which instructed the ship to go no closer than
							thirteen nautical miles from the North Korean land mass/offshore
							islands. Admiral Smith should be authorized to use the Sailing Order in
							the event that the North Koreans captured a copy of a 1966 <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Fleet directive which
							authorized surface patrols up to three nautical miles of the North
							Korean coast.<note n="4" xml:id="d276fn4">Telegram 116189 to Seoul,
								February 15, transmitted the text of the Sailing Order. Instructions
								for <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> on presenting the
								instructions to the North Koreans were transmitted in telegram
								116190 to Seoul, February 15. (Both ibid.)</note> This instruction
							was, of course, superseded by the Pueblo's Sailing Order.</p>
                        <p>We have checked with the office which controls reconnaissance flights
							over North Korea and have been informed that such flights are suspended
							pending receipt of approval from you. In a separate memo to you I am
							recommending that no reconnaissance be scheduled until there is a “go”
							sign from you.</p>
                        <p>If no progress is made at the next closed meeting, we shall have
							seriously to consider possible pressure tactics against the North
							Koreans. The Korean Working Group has staffed out five such

							Meeting, Panmunjom, February 16.</p>
                        <p>1. In essence, preliminary review of attendees' notes and tape recording
							reveals today's meeting produced very little in the way of progress. Pak
							was notably less truculent today but stated his position firmly. That
							position was:</p>
                        <p>(A) If Pueblo crew is to be returned at early date US side must change
							its attitude and provide apology and assurances of nature Pak demanded
							at sixth meeting.</p>
                        <p>(B) Return of ship cannot be subject of discussion on grounds there is no
							precedent for return of equipment used in espionage. Pak stated it
							“therefore will be better not to mention ship again.”</p>
                        <p>2. At today's meeting Pak showed photostats of alleged confessions Pueblo
							crew and of various ship documents<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> received copies of
								Bucher's and Murphy's alleged confessions, a photograph of the cover
								of a document entitled “Position Log Record” with a notation “Odd
								Day Log” and “Federal Supply Service 7530–28608363,” photographs of
								various record books, and photographs of two maps allegedly plotting
								the Pueblo's course. (Telegram 4301 from Seoul, February 16;
								National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US) On
								February 16 the North Koreans also released a joint letter of
								apology from the entire crew of the Pueblo for having violated North
								Korean territorial waters and other acts. (Memorandum from Rostow to

                        <p>3. RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> read both

							assertions” and several times played on theme that to cling to this
							attitude will not be beneficial to US side. On several occasions he also
							requested careful study of statements he made at sixth meeting. He did,
							however, expressly reserve right to comment on <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statements of today at next
							meeting and agreed to call next meeting as soon as he had received reply
							to <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statements.

                        <p>We are preparing a draft for Chip to look at. Its general line would
							be:</p>
                        <p>a. We have abided by the Soviets advice;</p>
                        <p>b. We have not been belligerent and have kept the lid on in the United
							States and South Korea;</p>
                        <p>c. We have stopped further deployments and turned the Enterprise
							around;</p>
                        <p>d. We have direct dealings with North Korea and have had seven
							meetings;</p>
                        <p>e. We have not had the slightest indication from the North that they are
							in any hurry to turn over the crew, and they have made clear they have

                        <p>f. We have reached the end of what we can say and concede;</p>
                        <p>g. Finally, that Mr. Vance has returned and confirms reports from our
							Ambassador that a very dangerous mood exists in South Korea, and
							continued raids across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or raids
							against the South could inflame the situation, and produce an even

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Request for Return of Dead and Wounded</hi>—We

                        <p>3. Your latest instructions to the U.S. senior representative at
							Panmunjom contained a fairly obvious warning to the North Koreans that
							seven meetings have proved unsatisfactory.<note n="4" xml:id="d279fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had been instructed
								to state at the Seventh Meeting that it was clear “that further
								meetings will only be repetitious on both sides.” (Telegram 116350

								RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
								33–6 KOR N–<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>S)</note> That will not
							move them. They are fully aware of our dissatisfaction, but as long as
							we are meeting and doing nothing else, they will not be moved by our
							views about progress or lack of it.</p>
                        <p>4. If it is now decided to apply other measures, I would begin by not
							responding for the time being to the next North Korean request for a
							closed meeting. I would not refuse a meeting—I would simply not respond.
							A brief message could be sent to North Korea through another channel to
							the effect we have had enough, that seven closed and three open meetings
							have proved useless. A clear warning about welfare of crew and
							responsibility of highest North Korean level should be included.</p>
                        <p>5. We could then commence a series of non-decisive measures, without
							verbal threats, which would engage North Korean attention. The first of
							these would be cancellation of leaves of all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military elements along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. After a short period (two or three days) to permit us to note any
							North Korean reaction, we could announce a black list of shipping to and
							from North Korean ports. The effect would be more psychological than
							substantial.</p>
                        <p>7. The next step would be to alert American dependents and non-essential
							personnel in Korea that the situation is not improving and that we
							advise visitors not to make plans to come to Korea for the time being.
							This would cause considerable comment and might have adverse effect on
							investment in Korea.</p>
                        <p>8. This would be followed by an air demonstration well inside [South]
							Korea, so handled as to have high press visibility.</p>
                        <p>9. At this point we would assess the North Korean reaction, if any, and
							decide in light of intelligence gathered through other sources whether
							to resume private meetings. This decision could of course be made
							anywhere along the line. If it seemed necessary to continue the process
							cited above, other measures such as blockade, closer-in naval/air
							demonstrations and actual evacuation of non-essential Americans here
							could be considered. Certainly, the last mentioned step would have
							ominous overtones.</p>
                        <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0663"/>
                        <p>10. I suggest serious consideration be given to the steps listed, in
							paragraphs 4 through 8, at the present time. If and as such a procedure
							is approved, we should take steps concurrently at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and elsewhere, to make known our feeling
							that we have done our best with the North Koreans who do not wish to
							settle the matter in a peaceful or honorable way.</p>
                        <p>11. I recommend this course of action because I have always felt it
							desirable to look and plan beyond what we are actually doing, especially
							with dealing with Communists. For understandable reasons, we have been a
							little too eager in this case and they have made us dance to their tune.
							As the process of recovering the men and ship now seems likely to be
							long drawn out for the reasons I have cited, I think our people would
							support a change of roles.</p>

							reading long statement which was later passed across table. No
							acceptable solution yet apparent. Return of ship not mentioned. After a
							long justification of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> position and
							action Pak then said (English version follows):</p>
                        <p>“I have noted your statement made at the previous meeting that your side
							will assure that 'United States naval vessels will continue to be
							ordered to remain more than twelve nautical miles from your coast.' I
							have also noted that the indication of the willingness of the U.S.
							Government to make an apology.</p>
                        <p>Such being the case I considered that the issue of the crew will be
							easily solved in case your side does not try to make the apology after
								<pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0664"/>the return of the crew but
							makes a proper apology on the basis of the confessions made unanimously
							by all the crew members including the captain of their intrusions into
							the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
							of their hostile acts.</p>
                        <p>At the previous meeting, you asked me when the crew of the Pueblo would
							be returned.</p>
                        <p>My answer to the question is that it completely depends upon your side
							which will take its position with regard to the matters raised by me in
							the above.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, your side should seriously study the statement I have made
							today.” End text.</p>

                        <p>1. As you will note from reftel and complete text of today's meeting to
							follow shortly,<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">Telegram 4391 from Seoul,
								February 20, transmitted the verbatim text of the meeting. (National
								Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69,
									<gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6, KOR N–US) A copy of
								this telegram was given to the President under a February 20
								memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> in
								which <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> suggested that
								“the issue is narrowed to a question of whether we are prepared to
								'make an apology' after the return of the crew, or on the basis of
								their 'unanimous confessions.'” <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>'s memorandum indicates that the President saw
								the telegram. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country
								File, Korea—Pueblo Incident—Cactus IIa, Cactus Seoul Cables,
								February 10 to February 28, 1968)</note> Pak uses apology by entire
							crew to alter NKorean position as stated in sixth (para 4X, Seoul 4261)
							and seventh (paras 3C <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0665"/>and 10,
							Seoul 4305) meetings.<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">Both telegrams
								transmitted the verbatim text of the respective meeting. Paragraph
								4X of telegram 4261 from Seoul, February 15, quotes the North
								Koreans as saying they will consider returning the crew members only
								when the United States “apologizes for the fact that the US
								Government dispatched the armed spy ship Pueblo to the territorial
								waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, conducted
								espionage activities and perpetrated hostile acts, assuring (and
								assures) that it will not commit such criminal acts again.”
								Paragraphs 3C and 10 of telegram 4305 from Seoul, February 16,
								contain Pak's restatement of that position. (National Archives and
								Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note> Position now
							is that confessions and apology by entire crew constitute all evidence
							US needs to take proper action and that the release of crew “will be
							easily solved” after US makes “proper apology.” In this meeting Pak
							perhaps indicated (see reftel) that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							side would be willing to consider expression of regret as an apology. It
							seems more likely, however, that “proper apology” means something more
							than post-release expression of regret dependent on findings of
							impartial inquiry. It clearly means apology in advance of crew's
							release. Pak's failure to repeat request for assurance in his final
							statement and his notation of RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement at seventh meeting that US will assure
							that US naval vessels will continue to be ordered to remain more than
							twelve nautical miles from <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> coast may
							indicate satisfaction on this essentially secondary point, but this is
							only inference and is not spelled out.</p>
                        <p>2. Main portion of Pak's statement today was devoted to repetitive
							references to fact that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had
							dispatched armed spy ship to intrude into NKorean territorial waters to
							conduct hostile acts. (Although Pueblo's activities are described in
							various ways, phrase “hostile acts” is repeated in almost every other
							sentence.) Pak also makes passing reference to fact that <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> has “full right” to punish crew
							members in accordance national law, but that in consideration of crew's
							apology for their crime, their oath not to repeat criminal acts, and
							their appeal for lenient forgiveness, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							side has expressed position that it will consider their return when
								<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has made proper apology and
							assurance. He also makes reference to six intrusions of territorial
							waters between January 15 and 23, to allegation that Pueblo fired on KPA
							naval craft, and to existence of “abnormal hostile relations” between
								<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> and US.</p>
                        <p>3. Pak made no mention of return of vessel itself in this meeting.</p>
                        <p>4. RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> reports that Pak
							today was more polite and circumspect in his attitude than he has been
							at any other previous meeting. He spoke slowly, carefully and politely,
							and seemed determined to make his points without arousing emotional
							response. In light of fact that Pak made it clear in his opening
							statement that timing on return <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0666"/>of crew would depend on prior US apology, RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> saw no point in demanding
							specific date for return.</p>
                        <p>5. Will pouch tape recording and English and Korean versions of Pak's
							statement which he provided RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> at close of meeting.</p>

                        <p>119560. 1. We are unable for a variety of reasons to meet the North
							Korean request at the eighth meeting for an apology based on the
							confessions and other documents as a condition for the release of the
							men. Since North Koreans have refused to accept our offer to express
							regrets after an official inquiry, in the event results of inquiry
							justify our doing so, we may be approaching a deadlock in these private
							meetings of U.S. and North Korean seniors at Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>2. We are therefore contemplating a four-pronged effort to find a
							solution.</p>
                        <p>3. At the next meeting we propose to say that the North Korean proposal
							for an apology in advance of the release on the basis of the confessions
							and documents submitted to us does not offer any possibility of a
							solution. We will repeat our offer of an inquiry after the men and ship
							have been released and say we will submit the <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0667"/>confessions and documents to the Board
							of Inquiry as evidence pertinent to the inquiry.<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">In reply the Embassy in Moscow strongly urged
								omitting this proposal and proceeding directly to the next
								alternative. <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
								believed doing so “would greatly increase possibility of Soviets
								bringing pressure on North Koreans although I am not sanguine they
								will go very far in any event.” <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> also noted that making “graduated
								concessions may encourage Koreans to hold out for more.” (Telegram
								2888 from Moscow, February 23; National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. If the foregoing is not acceptable to the North Koreans we will offer
							them the alternative of an investigating commission once the crew,
							documents and vessel are released, to examine all aspects of the seizure
							and all documents and statements, and make its finding public. Each side
							would appoint a member and the two sides would agree on a third member
							from another country to serve as chairman. If the findings find us
							culpable we will offer to express regrets.</p>
                        <p>5. It is virtually certain the North Koreans will reject the
							investigating commission and possibly both proposals, but at least they
							will have something to chew on.</p>
                        <p>6. Before calling the ninth meeting we would make the following
							additional moves.</p>
                        <p>7. Embassy Seoul would approach the Swiss and Swedish members of the
							Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and inform them that the eight
							meetings have produced no result. For their private information, we have
							offered to express regrets after the men are released and an official
							inquiry held, should our findings warrant such expression, but the North
							Koreans are demanding an apology now based on the confessions and
							documents as a condition of release.<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3">The
								Swiss and Swedish members had received similar information from the
								Czech and Polish members, who met with Pak on February 21 to discuss
								the status of the crisis. (Telegram 4418 from Seoul, February 22;
								ibid.)</note> That offers no possibility of a settlement as far as
							we are concerned. They should also be told of the alternate offer we
							will make at the next meeting. All this for their private
							information.</p>
                        <p>8. What we would like the Swiss and Swedes to do, or either one,
							depending on what Seoul and they decide, is to convey to the Poles and
							Czechs their alarm at the delay in releasing the vessel and crew. They
							can venture their opinion that the U.S. must hold an inquiry after the
							release, and that clearly the confessions and other documents will be
							introduced into that inquiry. Further that the Americans will have to
							publish the results, and if there was any violation or fault, the
							Americans would have no choice except to apologize. The North Koreans
							have got all the propaganda value they can out of the case, <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0668"/>and what is now required are moves to
							ease the tensions arising from the seizure of the Pueblo. If the North
							Koreans try to press the U.S. too far and make impossible demands on
							them, the already grave situation can become even graver. They therefore
							urge the Czechs and Poles to try to impress on the North Koreans the
							need for an immediate release.<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">At a meeting
								on February 25 <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> asked
								the Swede and Swiss members if they would impart this information to
								the Polish and Czech members and if they, in turn, would report it
								to the North Koreans. The Swede and Swiss members agreed and
								anticipated the information being passed to Pak. (Telegram 4476 from
								Seoul, February 25; ibid.) That and a follow-up meeting produced
								little, and in telegram 121942 to Seoul, February 28, the Department
								of State advised the Embassy that the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> approach had been taken “as far as can be useful
								for the time being.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>9. The third move will be made with the Russians, possibly through
								<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> or <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> or both or in a highest level
							or ministerial level message.<note n="5" xml:id="d282fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s inclination was to
								send a letter from <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to
									<persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>, if only to
								preserve the record, although that step could make it somewhat more
								difficult for the Soviets to act. If the Soviets were approached
								through an informal discussion, <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> suggested a meeting between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. (Telegram 2888 from Moscow, February 23;
								ibid.)</note> We will supply the Soviets with the transcripts of the
							eighth closed meeting, and indicate our plans for the ninth meeting. We
							would stress that an apology before an inquiry after the men are
							released is out of the question, and that if the North Koreans do not
							accept either of our proposals or come up with a reasonable solution,
							then we have reached the end of what we can say to the North Koreans or
							offer them. We could indicate our concern about reports that crew will
							be tried. We would let the Russians draw the conclusion that we shall
							soon have to tell our people and the UN that the meetings have produced
							no results. Our hope is that the Russians will get to the North Koreans
							before the next meeting or soon thereafter and urge on them the need to
							affect an early termination of this matter by release.</p>
                        <p>10. Our fourth approach will be to the Japanese and British, the two main
							non-communist trading or shipping nations with North Korea. They will be
							informed of our plans for the next meeting and of our general view that
							it looks as if we are reaching the end of these talks. They will be
							asked to inform the North Koreans privately at an appropriate time after
							the ninth meeting—if no progress is indicated there—that the gravity and
							tension in the area are such that they are considering suspension of all
							shipping into North Korean ports. We shall ask the Japanese and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to agree in principle to suspend shipping
								<pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0669"/>if we should ask them to do

                        </p>
                        <p>1. We agree with general thrust of reftel, which as we interpret it is
							that (a) North Koreans show no signs of willingness accept our past
							proposal, (b) that closed meetings cannot be continued much longer, <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0670"/>and (c) time has come to go to
							outer limits of our position, backed by as much support as we can muster
							by third parties. In general, we concur that efforts it outlines are
							worth undertaking. Following comments are designed primarily to indicate
							limitations that apply to such efforts and some pitfalls we foresee.</p>
                        <p>2. North Koreans are now awaiting our comment on their demand for apology
							in advance of crew release. If this is completely unacceptable to us, we
							agree that ninth meeting is time to say so. We see no harm in repeating
							our previous proposal for purpose of establishing absolute clear record
							of their refusal of our offer. (And we are convinced they will not
							accept it.) There is possibility that proposed procedure could result in
							Pak going back for further instructions, resulting in a tenth meeting
							before Adm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> could table
							alternative suggested para 4 reftel.</p>
                        <p>3. We agree with implication in reftel that offer of investigating
							commission should be made, at least for record purposes and as
							indication our willingness to bring impartial judgment to bear on Pueblo
							case. It would no doubt be to our advantage with respect to world
							opinion to be able to say we made such an offer and that NKs rejected
							it, as we agree they would probably do. Certainly there is little in
							their private or public positions on Pueblo or in their past history to
							suggest they would agree to anything like impartial outside inquiry into
							their affairs.</p>
                        <p>4. In highly unlikely event they consent to concept of investigating
							commission, negotiations on establishment thereof would offer them
							variety of opportunities to delay and wrangle. There is serious doubt
							that we and they could ever agree on chairman to be chosen jointly by
							their rep and ours. They would doubtless balk at releasing crew before
							investigation began. They would also seek to enlarge scope of charges
							against us which commission should evaluate beyond mere question of
							whether Pueblo intruded into their territorial waters. In short, we
							should make this offer only if necessity to establish this kind of
							record is overriding and we should be prepared to state at outset in
							very clear terms just what it is we envisage commission will
							investigate.</p>
                        <p>5. Other moves suggested reftel would be useful in terms of eventually
							establishing our case before world opinion. We are not hopeful, however,
							that Swiss and Swedes can accomplish much. They can talk only to Czech
							and Polish members of <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, who in turn
							can talk only to Pak or to their own and perhaps Russian embassies in
							Pyongyang. As Dept recognizes, <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> is
							channel of limited utility, available for passing information but not
							for exertion of pressure.</p>
                        <p>6. Para 8 reftel also raises some other questions, which precise Swiss
							and Swede would doubtless inquire about. If they tell the Pole and Czech
							that we would have no choice but to apologize if impartial inquiry
							reveals any violation or fault, what will this imply to North <pb n="639" xml:id="pg_639" facs="0671"/>Koreans? Violation or fault
							with respect to territorial waters? Or violation in terms also of other
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> charges: commission of espionage,
							hostile acts, war provocation, etc. Does it mean we will punish crew?
							Does apology mean we abandon position that Pueblo was naval vessel with
							right to be where it was and doing what it was, and that only recourse
							of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> under international law was to warn
							and escort it out of territorial waters?</p>
                        <p>7. We agree with reftel that attempt to engage support or pressure from
								<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Japan and Sovs could be useful.
							We question, however, need to provide them with transcripts of closed
							meetings. This is more than we have been doing with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, and if word got back to our friend
							here that we have provided something to Japanese and Soviets, in both
							form and substance, which goes beyond what we have told them, we would
							have another <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> eruption. Accordingly
							urge that Moscow, London and Tokyo not pass transcripts until Dept has
							decided what we do about <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s in this
								matter.<note n="3" xml:id="d283fn3">In reply the Department of State
								made note of <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>'s
								comments, but was reluctant to provide the South Koreans with
								transcripts “because of well-known <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> proclivity of leaking documents to press.” The
								Embassy was instructed to continue briefing the President or Prime
								Minister on the substance of the meetings. (Telegram 120307 to
								Seoul, February 14; National Archives and Records Administration, RG
								59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6
								KOR N–US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. This leads of course to observation of immediate importance to us in
							Seoul that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would not be very happy
							if they had full information on positions we have taken heretofore and
							would bitterly oppose notion that we would submit our case to
							investigating commission which would include friends of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> and before which US and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> would appear as equals. We may simply
							have to live with their reaction, but we should not minimize its
							importance simply because they are now quiescent.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, while argumentation in para 12 reftel would be useful in
							appeals to Sovs, Japanese and Brits, we should recognize that it has no
							relationship to real attitudes of either North Koreans or <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s. North Koreans find heightened tension
							in this area entirely to their advantage for a complex of reasons. They
							have deliberately raised tension and we fully expect that their future
							actions will be carefully calculated to maintain it. They have obviously
							decided long ago that stability in this area works only to advantage of
							their sworn enemies and they have taken serious risks to upset that
							stability. They must regard Pueblo seizure and Blue House raid as highly
							successful operations from their point of view, results of which
							indicate that US at least will tolerate very high degree of tension,
							perhaps one ruinous to US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations
							and stability in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and that they run
							little risk of retaliation unless <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							get out of hand.</p>
                        <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0672"/>
                        <p>10. As for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s, return of Pueblo and
							crew under conditions which we have proposed would not relieve their
							anxieties, frustrations and desire to retaliate. We do not expect that
							prior return of Pueblo and crew would have material effect on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> desire to retaliate. If North Koreans
							resume raids in March, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s will want to
							retaliate whether or not crew has been returned.</p>

                        <p>120290. Subject: Instructions for Ninth Closed Meeting.</p>
                        <p>1. You should request next closed meeting soonest.</p>
                        <p>2. At next meeting, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should open with following statement.</p>
                        <p>a. In previous meetings, I have made a specific proposal for resolving
							the controversy over the Pueblo and its crew. I have made it quite clear
							that the US Government is prepared upon the return of the ship and its
							crew to conduct a full inquiry and to make the results public. We have
							taken note of the various documents which you have handed over in these
							meetings. I can assure you that these documents<note n="2" xml:id="d284fn2">The phrasing here and elsewhere was changed to
								“photographs of documents” on Seoul's recommendation that merely to
								refer to “documents” could “mislead the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s into believing that we accept these photographs as
								valid evidence” and because of <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s reluctance “to concede that any meaningful
								documents have been received at these meetings if this is not really
								the case.” (Yager/Ericson/<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> Telcon, February 24, and telegram 120342 to
								Seoul, February 25; both in National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note> are <pb n="641" xml:id="pg_641" facs="0673"/>pertinent to the proposed
							inquiry and will be submitted to it. It would, of course, be important
							to authenticate these documents by testimony of the crew members
							involved.</p>
                        <p>b. As I have also previously made clear, we are willing to express regret
							if the inquiry would justify our doing so.</p>
                        <p>c. An expression of regret based exclusively on the documents you have
							provided might later prove inconsistent with the facts which a full and
							impartial inquiry would disclose. Moreover, until the officers and the
							men of the Pueblo have been released, the evidence which you have
							submitted is unverifiable either by us or by anyone else. In any event,
							an expression of regret on our part prior to a full inquiry into the
							facts and in advance of the release would not be understood by the
							American people.</p>
                        <p>d. Our previous discussions in these meetings indicate that factual
							questions divide us. There is no dispute that the Pueblo's mission was
							to gather intelligence. We disagree as to precisely where this mission
							was carried out and where the Pueblo was seized. The U.S. is not
							reluctant to have these factual issues resolved.</p>
                        <p>e. We would welcome any impartial resolution of this disagreement and
							would be willing to have the facts reviewed by any impartial,
							international, factfinding body. For example, we would accept assignment
							of this task to any person or persons named by the President of the
							International Court of Justice.</p>
                        <p>f. We are prepared to express regrets, if the international body should
							find that, in violation of its orders, the Pueblo entered waters closer
							than 12 nautical miles to North Korea.</p>
                        <p>g. Whatever the body agreed upon, we do not see how an impartial inquiry
							into the facts could be conducted with the crew still in North Korean
							hands. We believe it would be appropriate to return the crew immediately
							to the United States. We would, however, accept release of the crew to
							the custody of a neutral party, for example the Swiss Government.</p>
                        <p>h. I urge you to consider most seriously adopting one of the concrete
							approaches to settling this matter which we have placed before you.</p>
                        <p>3. Pak will presumably not be in a position to respond to our proposals
							at this meeting. If this is the case, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should say:</p>
                        <p>a. As you can see we have given most serious consideration to everything
							you have said in these meetings. We have placed before you concrete
							proposals which, if accepted by you, would permit settlement of the
							matter before us.</p>
                        <p>b. You have now held the crew of the Pueblo for over a month. We can see
							no reason why you should want to detain them further.</p>
                        <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0674"/>
                        <p>c. I hope that you will give me an answer to our proposals at our next
							meeting which will result in an immediate release.<note n="3" xml:id="d284fn3">The ninth senior <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> members meeting was held on February 26. In

                        <p>1. It is now a month since North Korean patrol boats forcibly seized the
							USS Pueblo in international waters. Despite the clear illegality of this
							action and despite the strong emotions which it has aroused in the
							United States, we have shown considerable restraint and made every
							effort to arrive at a quick, peaceful solution. As you know, we have
							acted on your advice by making certain adjustments in our posture in the
							hope of facilitating a prompt settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. We have now had eight private meetings in direct talks at Panmunjom.
							As you know, copies of the verbatim transcripts of the meetings have
							been given to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, since we wish to be sure you are fully informed on
							what has transpired at Panmunjom.</p>
                        <p>3. Our position in these talks has been moderate and reasonable. We
							offered to conduct a full and impartial inquiry after the ship and its
							personnel have been returned to us. We further offered to express our
							regrets if that inquiry develops facts which would warrant our doing so.
							The North Koreans reacted negatively to these proposals. At the next
							meeting, we will offer to submit the Pueblo problem to an impartial
							fact-finding body provided the personnel are first released into our
							custody or into neutral hands. We will tell the North Koreans that if
							the commission should find that, in violation of its instructions, the
							Pueblo entered waters closer than 12 miles to the North Korean coast, we
							would express regret.</p>
                        <p>4. We do not see how we can go further. Nor do we believe that by any
							objective standards should we be expected to do more. The present acute
							tensions in the area have not diminished. I think you will agree that it
							is in your interest as well as ours that this vexing problem is resolved
							without further delay.</p>
                        <p>5. These tensions have their origin primarily in the behavior of the
							North Koreans. You know of the raid on Blue House and of the numerous
							violations of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. Beyond this, the
							North Koreans have recently voiced irresponsible threats which can only
							serve to inflame the situation.</p>
                        <p>6. Let me give you just a few examples. At the open meeting of Military
							Armistice Commission on February 19, senior North Korean representative
							declared that North Korea would exchange “punishment for punishment,
							retaliation for retaliation, and all-out war for all-out war.” Just
							prior to this, on February 17, North Korean Vice Premier Pak Song-chol
							made an equally intemperate statement in which he concluded: “If the US
							imperialists and the Pak Chong-hui clique should dare attempt some
							retaliatory action, it will at once mean the beginning of war. The US
							imperialists and their stooges should take a square look at reality and
							act with discretion. Whether a new war will break out or not in Korea
							depends entirely on the attitude of the US imperialists and their
							stooges. The more the US imperialists cling to intimidation, <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0676"/>blackmail, and war clamors, the more
							complicated the current situation will become. If they gain anything
							from this, it will be only corpses and death.”</p>
                        <p>7. North Korean spokesmen have said publicly that the Pueblo crew may be
							tried and punished. This was said here in Moscow by the North Korean
							Charge d'Affaires. This is highly irresponsible behavior, and clearly
							any such action would seriously aggravate the already tense
							situation.</p>
                        <p>8. Mr. Cyrus Vance recently returned from talks with high officials in
							Seoul and confirms reports from our Ambassador that the South Koreans'
							patience is sorely tried. They are angered at what the North Koreans
							have already done and what they understand they plan to do in the
							future. Captured agents over the past years have provided a picture of
							size and character of North Korean training program to infiltrate
							saboteurs and assassins. There are other indications that point to a
							step-up in campaign of violence against Republic of Korea in the very
							near future. We should both consider very carefully what might develop
							in this potentially explosive situation, if Republic of Korea is subject
							to more depredations such as attack on Blue House on January 21.</p>
                        <p>9. We are doing our utmost to restrain the Republic of Korea, and we hope
							Soviets are exerting similar effort with North Koreans. Neither of us is
							in complete control of situation, but we should do what we can to
							prevent a flare-up. Immediate release of Pueblo and its crew will
							contribute to relief of the tension. We wanted you to know these facts
							regarding the situation before the North Koreans made any reply to our
								offer.<note n="4" xml:id="d285fn4">

                        <p>1. I saw <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> at 1430 today and
							made oral demarche per reftel.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> confirmed receipt
							verbatim transcripts Panmunjom meetings which had been given to
								<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> and wondered if I
							could summarize to him proceedings last meeting. This connection, it
							became obvious that some confusion exists in Soviet mind re number of
							private meetings held, since Kornienko, who also present, said they had
							received transcripts of eight meetings and thought another, ninth,
							meeting had taken place on February 21. In particular, Gromyko wondered
							whether we had answered all questions put forward by North Koreans and
							whether any progress had been made.</p>
                        <p>3. I said I did not have report on last meeting with me, but noted North
							Koreans had demanded apology before release of ship and crew and
							rejected our offer conduct impartial inquiry on our own. Now we intended
							offer impartial investigation by completely outside body.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said that on basis
							information Soviets had from different sources he could say little at
							this time. If he spoke at length, he was afraid that would result in
							repetition of what had been said in <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName>'s message and his own statement to me earlier.
							He stressed Soviets hoped very much problem would be settled, the sooner
							the better. Soviets not sure U.S. using all possibilities. He said he
							had noted in my statement assertion that detention had been illegal; in
							fact, entire U.S. position seemed to be based on this assertion. He did
							not wish dwell at length on this point but wanted to state that Soviet
							views on it as stated before still valid.<note n="3" xml:id="d286fn3">The Soviet view was also repeated in a letter from <persName corresp="#p_KAN1">Kosygin</persName> to Prime Minister Wilson
								written in response to a British appeal that the Soviets exert their
								influence with the North Koreans to resolve the crisis. (Telegram
								6716 from London, February 26; National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. I said we believed disagreement may be result of each side's basing
							itself on different facts. Therefore, we making offer of impartial
							investigation those facts. As I had noted in my oral statement, it
							difficult see what more we could do. In any event, we could not rely on
							statements by other side or other statements which we doubt had been
							made voluntarily.</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0678"/>
                        <p>6. Asking rhetorically if U.S. would agree to impartial investigation of
							U.S. statements re situation in other parts of world, <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said proposition would not
							satisfy other side. He wondered whether North Koreans had accepted
							proposal. I explained we had not yet made this offer, but intended to do
							so at next meeting. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said
							question arose what could be regarded as impartial. After all, past U.S.
							actions in Korea had been under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> label
							but <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had had nothing to do with them. I
							stressed we meant an impartial investigation which should be acceptable
							to North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said he was sure we
							knew Soviets wanted problem resolved as soon as possible. I said we
							believed Soviets rational people, and we also thought the sooner this
							dangerous situation resolved the better for everyone. As to <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName>'s remarks re impartiality, we
							did not exclude possibility facts might be against us but we prepared
							accept results impartial investigation.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said main thing was for
							U.S. to tell its people not to engage in this sort of activity; as
							experience had shown, such activity might result in precarious
							situation. I pointed out our crews had their instructions to stay out of
							territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Although <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> was cautious in his reaction, I believe he was
							impressed by position we are taking and would guess that Soviets will at
							least recommend if not urge North Koreans to accept.</p>

                        <p>122259. Subject: Instructions for Tenth Closed Meeting.</p>
                        <p>1. Since ball is now in North Korean court, we see no need to supply
							Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> with detailed
							instructions for next closed meeting. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> will probably have to do no more than listen to

                        <p>2. We recognize that Pak may try to avoid direct and specific response on
							our new proposals by repeating position he has taken at earlier meetings
							and merely denouncing our position in general terms. If Pak does adopt
							this or other unresponsive line, Smith should say:</p>
                        <p>a. At this meeting, I had hoped to receive your serious and carefully
							considered reactions to the various concrete proposals for settling the
							Pueblo case which I made at our last meeting. I urge you to study those
							proposals more thoroughly and come to the next meeting prepared either
							to accept one of them or to tell me in precisely what respect you
							believe they should be modified, and why.</p>
                        <p>b. We have now had ten private talks. We should be well past the stage of
							general discussion and should focus on specific means of reducing the
							dangerous level of tension in this area by releasing the officers and
							men of the Pueblo from the detention in which they have been held for
							far too long, and by returning the ship itself to United States
							control.</p>

                        <p>1. Today's meeting lasted 48 minutes, mostly devoted to uncompromising
							presentation by Pak of NKorean position as stated in sixth and
							subsequent meetings and equally firm rejection of proposals we put
							forward at ninth meeting. At end of his opening statement, Pak handed
							RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> English version with
							heading again describing him as rep of Govt of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>. He also gave <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> handwritten letter addressed to President
								<persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> purportedly signed by
							entire crew, including wounded. Letter says wounded in final stages of

								an analysis of the signatures appearing on the letter, were
								transmitted in telegram CAP 80651, March 4, from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>. In the letter, which had
								been read over Radio Pyongyang, the crew admitted violating North
								Korean territorial waters, argued that North Korea properly deserved
								an apology, and urged the President to issue an apology so that the
								crew could return to the United States. (Johnson Library, National

                            <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> accepted letter as
							“document addressed to President of the United States” to avoid any
							endorsement of authenticity.</p>
                        <p>2. Following Pak's long statement, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> made statement based on guidance contained para
							two, State 122259.<note n="4" xml:id="d288fn4">
                                <ref target="#d287">Document 287</ref>.</note> Pak responded with
							shortened version of his previous line. Meeting ended with Pak proposing
							recess after <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had said he
							would refer Pak's statement to appropriate authority and advise Pak when
							he had reply.</p>
                        <p>3. Believe following aspects this meeting are noteworthy:</p>
                        <p>A. Communists obviously used interval between meeting to draft letter to
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> with
							considerable care and to obtain (or possibly forge some of) crew's
							signatures.</p>
                        <p>B. Pak had carefully rehearsed his presentation. He deliberately
							projected tough image during portion of his statement in which he
							rejected impartial inquiry by third party and indicated U.S. in no
							position to “accept” release of crew to neutral custody. He added in
							very harsh tones that such remarks constitute defilement of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> sovereignty and asked rhetorically
							and sneeringly whether this meant U.S. believes <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> has neither law nor ability to deal with situation. He
							concluded this most dramatic portion of his presentation with statement
							in softer tones that it would be height of folly for US to believe that
							it can compel <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> to accept
							“unwarrantable” claims.</p>
                        <p>C. Pak's presentation contained only vaguest references to possibility
							that crew might be tried, but implication was present in such statements
							as: “As long as your side keeps on taking such an unwarranted stand as
							present at our meetings, our side will have no other way but to
							understand that your side has no concern about the fate of the crew of
							the Pueblo and tries to evade the responsibility for them. Accordingly,
							our side will have no alternative but to consider another step.”</p>
                        <p>D. In arguing for U.S. acceptance of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> position, Pak at one point referred to existence of
							“precedents of having settled similar cases in the past under the terms
							acceptable to both sides,” by which he doubtless meant helicopter
							crew.</p>
                        <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0681"/>
                        <p>E. Pak clearly left door open for further meetings, although there
							equally clearly no give in <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>
							position.</p>
                        <p>F. There was nothing in Pak's presentation to indicate <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> thinking in terms of prisoner swap or
							ransom as suggested last week by Czech and Polish <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. We should rule out definitively as inappropriate, unseemly, not in the
							American character, and a knuckling under to simple blackmail:</p>
                        <p>—a swap of Korean prisoners, of whatever ilk, for the Pueblo crew;</p>
                        <p>—any form of ransom;</p>
                        <p>—an apology if we are unable to establish that one is called for.</p>
                        <p>2. I reluctantly conclude that our best tack for the foreseeable future
							is sticking to the diplomatic pressures line, while building up,
							rapidly, substantially, and very overtly, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> capabilities.</p>
                        <p>3. U.S. forces in Korea, although understrength, should not be built up
							at this time because of Vietnam needs, balance of payments problems (the
							25,000 men required for minimal meaningful buildup would cost $200
							million per year), and various adverse readings which would be taken in
							many quarters because of greater American presence, other than in
							Vietnam, on the Asian continent.</p>
                        <p>4. While something like symmetrical retaliation theoretically would have
							been the best move immediately after the Pueblo capture, I do not
							believe we would now profit by small-scale harassing military actions.
							If there were one or more ships which could be “snatched,” I would not
							rule this out, but the Korean ships stay too close in and non-Korean
							ships should be off limits. Other harassing military actions would <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0682"/>not be designed to release the
							crew, but would probably have the opposite effect and would damage our
							legal position as the injured party. Such harassing actions would invite
							retaliation. There would almost certainly be gradual escalation and a
							second front could easily result.</p>
                        <p>5. While we are on the diplomatic course, and now that tensions are
							reduced, we might release a carrier force for Vietnam duty. It could
							return fairly quickly if needed and meanwhile its departure could give
							an excuse to the North Koreans to take a favorable step forward if they
							have any reason to do so.</p>
                        <p>6. In addition to beefing up <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							capabilities, we should build up our overall strategy posture from which
							we can speak and be listened to. This would mean calling up reserves,
							and keeping larger reserves in <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss>,
							but the better we are prepared the less likely we are to have to use
							additional force. We do not now have the military posture to take risks
							in Korea, according to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. While we should be ready to talk at all times, we should not play
							along in seeming weakness with the North Korean propaganda game by
							seeming to want frequent meetings. Each side has given its position and
							I don't see how we can alter our last position appreciably.
							Over-eagerness is weakness.</p>
                        <p>8. We should keep the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> channel open,
							but I am not sanguine as to its utility.</p>
                        <p>9. We may yet want to return to the UN, particularly if a trial seems
							likely and the Panmunjom talks can be shown to have broken down because
							of North Korean unreasonableness. We should prepare thoroughly for this
							contingency through such means as a detailed handwriting analysis of the
							recent letter to the President, and its signatures. The North Koreans
							are on a weak wicket in any multilateral forum, because of the
							increasingly convincing record of fabrication on their part.</p>
                        <p>10. As galling as it is, I fear that on this Pueblo case we may have to
							lick our wounds, wait out release of the crew, and wait our chances for
							action when the advantage is more ours. The only way I see where we
							could act sooner would be in Vietnam—presumably by mining Haiphong
							Harbor. North Korean actions seem partly designed to aid the Communist
							Vietnam effort and it is important that we not permit that to
							happen.</p>
                        <p>11. Some people in town are playing with the idea of coming a bit closer
							to what the North Koreans want by way of an apology. I do not quite
							understand what we have to apologize for unless we did invade
							territorial waters, but this presumably we do not yet know. It seems to
							me that absolutely basic to problems of this sort is the integrity,
							prestige and credibility of the United States. As tempting as it might
							be to make an apology—with tongue quite prominently in cheek—in <pb n="651" xml:id="pg_651" facs="0683"/>order to ransom the 83 crew
							members, I believe that such opportunistic duplicity would be playing
							loose with the ultimate security of 200 million Americans. In today's
							world the adversary can escalate—short of allout war—to match us. Short
							of allout war, then, our one tremendous advantage over the enemy lies
							not in what we do but in what we are. That must be safeguarded at all
							costs. It means we should not apologize unless an apology is in order
							just as it means we should apologize, with dignity, and promptness, if
							one is in order.</p>

                        <p>North Korea at the tenth closed meeting:</p>
                        <p>A. Rejected our offer of impartial inquiry.</p>
                        <p>B. Insisted on apology.</p>
                        <p>C. Indicated apology would make release of men possible.</p>
                        <p>D. Threatened “some other measure” if no apology forthcoming.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Next Steps Available:</p>
                        <p>A. Restate our ninth meeting position, i.e., that we are prepared to
							submit factual issues to an impartial international body, that we would
							express regrets if warranted by results of inquiry by such body and that
							we would accept release of men to neutral body prior to inquiry.</p>
                        <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0684"/>
                        <p>B. Try to get <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> to issue appeal for
							release of men primarily on humanitarian grounds.</p>
                        <p>C. Military moves (aerial feints, aerial reconnaissance, blockade,
							sailing USS Banner off North Korea under escort, etc.).<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">Next to this paragraph Walsh added the following
								handwritten notation: “<persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
								opposes this.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>D. Exploit internal inconsistencies in North Korean case (alleged
							confessions and navigational data) by either:</p>
                        <p>(1) Informing Russians of these inconsistencies and of fact we are
							seriously considering exposing North Korean case at United Nations,
								or<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">Next to this paragraph Walsh added
								the following handwritten notation: “<persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> thinks this premature.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) Simply publishing our analysis of North Korean “evidence”.</p>
                        <p>E. Offer in private Panmunjom talks to express regrets, concurrently with
							release of Pueblo crew, for any hostile acts contrary to international
							law which may have been committed by the Pueblo.<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4">Next to this paragraph Walsh added the following
								handwritten notation: “<persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName>
								prefers this.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>F. Ask North Koreans for precise language which they would accept as
							expression of regret justifying concurrent release of Pueblo and
							crew.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">3. Relevant Considerations:</p>
                        <p>A. Impartial inquiry non-starter. If held it could only show up North
							Koreans as liars.</p>
                        <p>B. If we stick to our present position, there is high risk of men being
							put on trial and punished.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> appeal almost certainly
							non-starter. North Koreans not interested in humanity.</p>
                        <p>D. Available military action would be mere pin-pricks unlikely to move
							North Koreans, and would probably prejudice chances of getting men
							back.</p>
                        <p>E. North Koreans would probably reject conditional expression of regret
							and insist on unqualified apology.</p>
                        <p>F. Apology, whether conditional or otherwise, can be undercut after
							return of crew. In tenth meeting, General Pak hinted that 1964
							helicopter case might be precedent. In that case (inadvertent
							intrusion), the North Koreans insisted that we admit “criminal
							espionage” as well as intrusion. General Combs signed receipt admitting
							“crimes of espionage and illegal intrusion…” and guaranteeing “that it
							will not commit such criminal acts… in the future”, but repudiated this
							admission publicly the next day. There appears to have been little or no
								<pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0685"/>adverse reaction in the US
							to the temporary admission of wrong-doing made to get the men back.</p>
                        <p>G. Soviets might be disturbed by any threat to expose North Korean
							“evidence” and might press Pyongyang to settle Pueblo case promptly.</p>
                        <p>H. Course followed by US in Pueblo case could have important impact on
							our relations with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and possibly also
							on those with South Viet-Nam and Thailand. Thus, abject apology,
							particularly after prolonged private negotiations, would outrage Seoul
							and probably also Saigon and Bangkok. On the other hand, open attack on
							North Korean evidence would clearly gratify these allies.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>Smoking out North Koreans on precise language of acceptable expression of
							regret would keep the private talks going and possibly provide us with
							useful information without in any way prejudicing any of the other
							options listed in 2. above. We therefore recommend approval of the
							attached draft instruction to Seoul for the eleventh meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d290fn5">The draft instruction was not attached. The
								memorandum does not indicate if the recommendation was approved or

                        <p>9439. 1. Last night we heard reading by an American voice of letter
							addressed to President which <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> was handed yesterday by Pak at Panmunjom. The tone
							of voice was subdued, as well it might be in view of degrading contents
							of letter. It is unimaginable that all 82 Americans of Pueblo would
							agree to such a condemnation of their government, their service and
							their principles after hardly more than one month's confinement unless
							they were subjected to harshest mental/physical pressures. I do not
							believe for a moment that all of them did. FBIS English language tape of
							1100/1200 GMT March four Pyong- yang broadcast to Southeast Asia would
							contain text mentioned.</p>
                        <pb n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0686"/>
                        <p>2. Broadcast no doubt monitored by governmental and private services, and
							if its sequence of admission of guilt and abject apology comes to public
							attention at home strong reactions may result. Also, it would seem from
							present handling of letter that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s
							intend to keep repeating it, perhaps to lay foundation for whatever next
							move they may contemplate.</p>
                        <p>3. It is important, nevertheless, that officers and crew of Pueblo not be
							judged prematurely. Hopefully news media will cooperate in this. I
							suggest to deal with that aspect of matter and the problem generally,
							time may have arrived for you to consider complete press briefing in
							Washington during which efforts of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
							to bring about reasonable solution of this matter could be related.
							There would seem no longer to be basis for continued silence on
							Panmunjom meetings. The <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s appear to be
							preparing field for further action against crew, and their use and
							re-use of “confessions,” “admissions of guilt,” and “apologies” should
							no longer go unchallenged. I do not know whether there is still a steel
							fist inside that silken glove, everything considered, but I am sure that
							our approach to this problem has been characterized by both restraint
							and reason of which our people would approve.</p>
                        <p>4. It might be desirable to give Pak notice at next meeting that we
							intend to publicize our proposals to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							which we consider fair and reasonable, and then to note his reaction. It
							will probably be nasty, and could bring about end to present series of
							discussions at Panmunjom. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s would call
							for and claim we are breaking understanding for mutual agreement on what
							we would say publicly about those proceedings. It might also force their
							hand on trial of crew, and we should be prepared to face this
								contingency.<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">In telegram 125332 to
								Seoul, March 6, the Department of State advised that a response to
								an announcement that the crew would be tried was being considered
								and asked for Embassy suggestions to prepare for that eventuality.
								The Department of State also admitted that the closed talks may have
								reached a dead end, but they would not be broken off yet.
								(Ibid.)</note> But Pak's performance yesterday confirmed what we
							here have believed since this exercise began—that is, that we will not
							be able to get back these men on anything resembling our terms. The
							exercise was necessary but unless it is desirable to keep it going to
							cover up other possibly useful contacts, it seems to have run its
							course. As to next moves, several possibilities were mentioned in State

							Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that the Department

							Meeting at Panmunjom, March 9, 1968.</p>
                        <p>1. Meeting began at 1200 hrs March 9 and ended at 1253.<note n="2" xml:id="d293fn2">Telegram 4797 from Seoul, March 9, transmitted the

								telegram 125424 to Seoul, March 6, Smith was instructed to restate
								the proposals submitted at the ninth meeting and request a North
								Korean response to them. (Ibid.)</note> Apparently anticipating that
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> would reiterate our
							basic position, Pak responded after short interval with prepared
							statement which began by referring to fact that at previous meetings he
							had “already clearly” told <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> about “unwarrantedness of your side's claim on the
							matter of crew of armed spy ship Pueblo.” This prepared statement
							contained much of language Pak used at past two meetings. In essence he
							said if US sticks to its position this will only create artificial
							difficulties, further complicate situation, and give no help in solving
							matter. If US really wants to solve problem of crew, it should not ask
							NKorea to return criminals for nothing but should accept just and
							reasonable NKorean proposal which will make it possible to have crew
							returned.</p>
                        <p>3. At mid-point of his statement Pak again implied that crew might be
							punished, saying in effect that if US sticks to its proposal NKorea can
							only conclude that US has neither concern about fate of crew nor
							intention to bear responsibility for them, in which case NKorea “would
							have no alternative but to take another step.”</p>
                        <p>4. RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> took this
							opportunity to use language from State 123157<note n="4" xml:id="d293fn4">Dated March 1. (Ibid.)</note> to effect that any
							trial, punishment or threat of punishment can only aggravate already
							serious situation. Pak asked for written copy of this statement, which
							was provided.</p>
                        <p>5. After pause of nineteen minutes, during which he carefully wrote and
							checked his reply, Pak made statement which in essence repeated language
							of his first statement, again describing US proposal as request for
							return of crew in exchange for “nothing” from US side.</p>
                        <p>6. Meeting ended with brief exchange devoted to <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s request that NKorean side
							carefully study US statements and to agreement that Pak would call next

                        <p>1) At next meeting <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should
							try to pin Pak down on fact that crew will in fact be released without
							trial or punishment concurrently with expression of regret and assurance
							that US ships will continue to be ordered to stay out of 12 mile
							limit.</p>
                        <p>2) If Pak officially confirms this we would then propose to express
							regret at time of release “for any hostile acts contrary to
							international law which may have been committed by the USS Pueblo.”</p>
                        <p>(Obviously there is an infinity of variations on this theme which could
							be considered in drafting our expression of regret.)</p>
                        <p>3) Immediately upon release of the crew we would publish our refutation
							of the NK “evidence” together with a blast at North Koreans for both
							their duplicity and their series of illegal and aggressive actions. This
							might give significant comfort to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that almost any variation of this formula would cause

                        </list>
                        <p>I am increasingly concerned about the American stance in the Pueblo
							situation. The position expressed at the Panmunjom closed meetings is
							basically the reiteration of the fact that we have no convincing proof
							that the Pueblo came within the 12 mile limit claimed by the North
							Korean Government, that we will not be in a position to determine this
							question until the crew is returned to us or to neutral third party
							custody, that we will investigate the charges promptly upon such return
								<pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0691"/>and, if the North Korean
							claim appears justified, will express appropriate regret.</p>
                        <p>This position appears to concede that we must respect the 12 mile limit
							and that, on its own definition of the territorial sea, the contiguous
							state may seize naval vessels of another power that venture within it
							and intern the crews.</p>
                        <p>Up to this point in history, our legal position has been that we do not
							recognize a territorial sea more than 3 miles from any shore and that
							instructions to our vessels to remain further off shore are an exercise
							of discretion rather than a legal necessity. Moreover, we have
							maintained that, under international law, the only right of the
							contiguous state is demand that the intruding vessel leave the
							territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>The closest approach to its shores claimed by North Korea is about 7.6
							nautical miles. The purported confessions of the Commanding Officer and
							crew admit such “intrusion” and implicitly assume that this is a
							violation of legitimate territorial sea claims. Our reaction has not
							emphasized that, under our construction of international law, our
							vessels are on the high seas when outside the 3 mile limit, that all
							American naval personnel are aware of this US position, and that the
							North Korean action was illegal even on their statement of the
							facts.</p>
                        <p>As a legal proposition, therefore, we should not be asserting our
							willingness to express regrets if subsequent investigation shows that
							the North Korean claims are correct and the “confessions” are bona fide.
							Under our legal interpretation, no claim of the North Koreans, even if
							accurate, could lead to an admission that we have violated the
							territorial waters of North Korea. And, as noted above, even if our ship
							had been within 3 miles, international law would not justify the seizure
							of our crew and ship and the killing of an American service- man.</p>
                        <p>It thus appears to me that we have already given away our legal position
							on the Pueblo seizure. We have indicated a willingness to apologize if
							the Pueblo ventured between the 3 mile limit we recognize and the 12
							mile limit claimed by the North Koreans. We have indicated this
							willingness despite the fact that the North Korean seizure of an
							American warship and its crew, occasioning the death of one crew member
							and the wounding of three others, is certainly a far more serious
							offense than any intrusion for non-violent purposes, within even the
							three mile limit we recognize. The implicit assumption is that the
							Pueblo's activities would warrant violent response if conducted in
							territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>We therefore are sticking on only the relatively minor factual issue: Did
							the Pueblo, in violation of orders, come closer than 12 but further than
							3 miles from North Korean territory? Perhaps we should now rely on the
							letter to the President from the Pueblo crew and try and <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0692"/>devise a statement that might satisfy
							the North Korean demands and effect their return.</p>
                        <p>Any such statement should, in my opinion, be predicated not on our legal
							obligations—since even the facts as claimed by the North Koreans would
							involve no violation of international law as we interpret it. It would
							instead have to be predicated on the fact that the purported confessions
							show a failure to abide by orders. It is obviously illogical to
							apologize to North Korea solely because US naval personnel have failed
							to obey US naval orders, but we are already in this anomalous and
							ignoble position. To get out of it, and to get our men back, it might be
							better to go the rest of the way.</p>
                        <p>A possible semantic formula might be for Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> to prepare a letter noting that
							President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> has received
							the letter that appears to be signed by the Pueblo crew; without mention
							of the North Korean claim of a 12 mile territorial sea, the United
							States has instructed its naval vessels to remain more than 12 miles
							from North Korean territory; the statements contained in the crew's
							letter show a failure on their part to obey orders; and the United
							States expresses its regrets at the violations described in the letter
							and repeats its intention to continue to order its ships to remain more
							than 12 miles from North Korean territory. This could be shown to
							General Pak at Panmunjom and he could be told it will be given to him
							concurrently with the return of the crew. No mention would be made of
							the ship.</p>
                        <p>Admittedly, this concession might involve some loss of prestige. But in
							my view, we have already capitulated on the major legal points involved
							and conceding the factual question on the basis of the crew's letter
							would be preferable to protracted maintenance of a demeaning stance.</p>
                        <p>Our capitulation then would turn solely on the statement of facts
							allegedly signed by the Pueblo crew. It would not imply that the
							Pueblo's mission was illicit. Establishment of the falsity of the
							statement would enable us to retract our apology. As you know, the Navy
							analysis indicates that the North Korean asserted intrusions could not
							possibly have been accomplished by a vessel of the Pueblo's speed. This
							evidence would be made public after the crew is returned. In addition,
							we would presumably have from the crew other evidence that their
							“confessions” were contrived or extorted. Our expressed regrets would
							then be withdrawn, because based on North Korean fraud. As things now
							stand, world opinion is probably that we've been caught in tawdry
							behavior. Exposure of North Korean lies would give us support we now
							lack.</p>
                        <p>It must be anticipated that adoption of this course of action would
							provoke strong adverse reactions from the South Koreans. If, however, it
							led to prompt return of the crew, and prompt withdrawal of our <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0693"/>apology, it might well be
							better for US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations than the
							continuation of the present futile closed meetings. A draft letter is
							attached.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The closed talks in Panmunjom appear to have reached an impasse. I
							believe that we must now choose one of five possible courses of
							action:</p>
                        <p>1. Stonewall repetition of our present position.</p>
                        <p>2. Publish falsity of North Korean “evidence”, with or without private
							advance notice to the U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>3. Offer conditional expression of regret.</p>
                        <p>4. Sign helicopter-type receipt.</p>
                        <p>5. Ask Pak for language of apology or receipt which would meet his
							requirements.</p>
                        <p>It is pretty clear now that stonewalling would achieve nothing but would
							damage the reasonable record which we have thus far made in <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0694"/>the talks and risk early trial and/or
							punishment of the crew. Exposing the North Korean “evidence” at this
							stage might both harden the North Korean position and precipitate a
							decision to try and punish the crew. The U.S.S.R. is not likely to be
							impressed by exposure of the falsity of North Korean evidence or to be
							either willing or able to be helpful. Signing a receipt similar to that
							signed by General Combs in the helicopter case would amount to the very
							humiliation of the U.S. which the North Koreans are seeking and would
							cause serious trouble with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.
							Asking Pak for his language would probably lead to prolonged
							negotiations damaging to our relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. In the end, we would probably have to choose between
							breaking off the talks or signing a humiliating statement.</p>
                        <p>Offering a conditional expression of regret also poses difficulties, but
							these appear to be of a lesser order than those noted for the other four
							possible courses of action. Thus, such an offer could lead to prolonged
							negotiations, but these might be avoided by indicating that the
							substance of our offer was not negotiable.</p>
                        <p>The possible formulation of conditional expressions of regret are of
							course almost infinite. The three best formulations which we have been
							able to come up with are set forth in the attachment in order of
							preference.</p>
                        <p>We also attach a draft presidential letter received informally from
							DOD/ISA which contains an expression of regret in response to the Pueblo
							crew's letter of February 29.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">See the
								attachment to <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> The
							principal difficulties which we see with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>'s suggestion are (1) it escalates the level of the
							expression of regret and therefore the degree of humiliation; (2) it
							would accord a degree of status to the North Korean regime and cause a
							violent reaction in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>; and (3) it
							appears to validate the letter ostensibly signed by all members of the
							crew.</p>
                        <p>As we now see it, a conditional expression of regret should probably not
							be tabled until the 13th meeting. We would use the 12th meeting
							primarily to request clarification of the North Korean position. A draft
							instruction for the 12th meeting is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">Not printed.</note>

                        <p>1. I acknowledge receipt of the 82 surviving members of the crew of the
							USS Pueblo and the body of Seaman Wayne D. Hodges.</p>
                        <p>2. On the occasion of the release of the Pueblo's crew, I am authorized
							to state:</p>
                        <p>A. The USS Pueblo, a commissioned ship of the United States Navy, was
							captured on January 23, 1968 by patrol craft of the Korean People's Army
							while engaged in an intelligence gathering mission off the coast of
							North Korea.</p>
                        <p>B. The North Korean authorities regard the Pueblo's mission as
							provocative and have provided the United States with photographic copies
							of documents which they regard as conclusive evidence that the Pueblo
							intruded into North Korean territorial seas.</p>
                        <p>C. As conditions for the release of the Pueblo's crew, the North Korean
							authorities have demanded that the United States both apologize and
							provide assurance that intrusions of the nature cited above will not
							occur in the future.</p>
                        <p>D. In response to these North Korean demands, I am authorized to
							declare:</p>
                        <p>1. Ships of the United States Navy will be ordered to remain more than 12
							nautical miles from the coast of North Korea.</p>
                        <p>2. The United States expresses regret for any hostile acts contrary to
							international law which may have been committed by the USS Pueblo.</p>

                        <p>After eleven closed meetings we have made little progress at Panmunjom.
							As conditions for the release of the crew (they have made clear they
							will not return the ship), the North Koreans demand:</p>
                        <p>—an admission by us of hostile acts and intrusion into their claimed
							territorial waters;</p>
                        <p>—“a proper apology”;</p>
                        <p>—a guarantee against future similar incidents.</p>
                        <p>We know—and can prove—that at least some of the documents which they have
							given us are falsified. <hi rend="italic">I firmly believe that we
								should not admit incursions which we are reasonably certain did not
								occur</hi>.</p>
                        <p>We have said that after release of the crew to our custody or that of a
							neutral power we would investigate thoroughly, and express regrets if
							any intrusion had in fact occurred. We have suggested that this
							investigation could be made by an impartial body. The North Koreans have
							responded that their “evidence” is conclusive and that an inquiry is
							unjustified. They have also said that if we persist in our attitude it
							will show “no concern for the crew”, and require them to take “other
							steps” against these men—presumably trial and/or punishment.</p>
                        <p>Pak has just advised the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> that U.S.
							proposals so far have been unsatisfactory (e.g., have not included an
							apology or offer of compensation) and that he does not propose to call
							or attend another meeting until he knows that we have some
							“constructive” proposals to make.</p>
                        <p>This, then, is where we now stand. Our next step is to see that the
							twelfth meeting is held fairly soon and to prepare instructions for it.
							At this point, I think it best that we pass the buck back to the North
							Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Thus, if you approve, we plan to instruct Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> to:</p>
                        <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"/>
                        <p>Send word to Pak through <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> that we
							expect him to call the twelfth meeting soon and that we would have
							something to say which would be of interest to him.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							would:</p>
                        <p>1. Say that we have a precise and constructive proposal, to wit:</p>
                        <p>That at the time of the release of the crew we would</p>
                        <p>—acknowledge the intelligence gathering mission of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>;</p>
                        <p>—assure North Korea that we would continue to instruct U.S. ships to
							remain more than 12 miles from the North Korean coast;</p>
                        <p>—express regret for any violations of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s
							orders which may have resulted in the ship's coming closer than 12 miles
							from North Korea. (This is slightly further than we have yet gone on
							regrets—and as far as I think we should go.)</p>
                        <p>2. Point out that Pak has not made equally precise proposals.</p>
                        <p>3. Remind Pak that, while we are concerned about the crew, our primary
							concern is with the heightening of tensions in the area caused by their
							provocative and illegal acts.</p>

                        <p>Concurrently, we plan to let the Russians know—perhaps through a reliable

							million in military aid to the South Koreans. It also will make it
							easier for the Administration to call up substantial reserves if this
							becomes necessary, and could always be an additional support for
							Administration calls for greater effort in Korea or Viet-Nam. We would
							expect that the Russians would pass this on to North Korea. (Chip Bohlen

                        <p>Once we have gone through the next meeting—which will probably produce no
							real forward movement—we will be hard against the decision on where to
							go next. We shall probably have two main choices:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Stonewall</hi>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> could defer calling another
							meeting and confine himself to informing Pak that he is prepared to meet
							again if Pak has something new and constructive to say.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> could call the next meeting and either:</p>
                        <p>—ask Pak for precise language for an apology which would lead to the
							release of the crew, or</p>
                        <p>—table a specific draft of the receipt which <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> would be willing to sign at the
							time the men are released.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">We must face the fact that it is unlikely that any
								course will lead to a quick return of the crew</hi>. If we stonewall
							now, there is perhaps a small chance that the North Koreans will advance
							some proposal that will get things moving again. But this is very
							unlikely. It is far more probable that they will continue along their
							present course, making propaganda points where they can. They may even
							decide—as a pressure tactic—to bring the crew to trial.</p>
                        <p>If we ask them to let us know what they want from us in way of an
							apology, they probably will refuse to give us anything. If they do come
							up with suggested language, it will almost certainly be something we
							can't possibly live with.</p>
                        <p>If we give them suggested wording for a receipt they will reject it, and
							we will be faced with a long series of meetings in which we will argue
							over language—to the benefit of the North Koreans.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">In my view, we should stonewall for a bit longer to
								see if the North Koreans move at all in our direction</hi>. But, if
							things drag on too long without result or without “further steps” by the
							North Koreans vis-a-vis the crew, I believe we should be prepared to
							break off the talks and publish the record. This will improve our public
							image here and abroad at the expense of North Korea's. It would make it
							virtually impossible to get the crew back in the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <p>In preparation for such a contingency, we are working on a White Paper
							which will give the full story of North Korean provocation, U.S.
							restraint, fairness and moderation at Panmunjom, and demonstrate the
							falsity of the North Korean “evidence”. This should certainly be <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0700"/>published in case the crew were
							put on trial, or if we or the North Koreans break off talks. (It could
							also be published immediately after the release of the crew, assuming we
							decide to go the conditional apology route and it is successful.)</p>
                        <p>We are all convinced that minor military actions or shows of force would
							have no constructive effect. Some really massive effort—such as an
							attempt to eliminate the North Korean Air Force—involves obvious costs
							and risks. We do not recommend it.</p>

                            <item>Possible Actions in the Event the North Koreans Announce that They
								Intend to Try the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Crew</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. At your request, we have considered what we might do if we were
							confronted by an announcement from Pyongyang that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s crew (or possibly only the officers) will be tried
							for alleged crimes under North Korean law.</p>
                        <p>2. The context in which such an announcement might be made would of
							course have a material bearing on how we should react. Thus, if the
							announcement came after the closed Panmunjom talks had been broken off
							and in a period of intensified North Korean raids on the South, there
							would be little reason for us not to take a very hard line. On the other
							hand, the announcement could conceivably be accompanied by indications
							that the North Koreans viewed the trial as a preliminary to releasing
							the crew. In this case, a softer reaction would be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>3. Under almost any circumstances, we believe that two actions should
							form part of our response to word that the crew was to be tried.</p>
                        <p>A. We should issue a public statement which would at a minimum brand the
							seizure, detention and trial of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew
							as illegal and <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0701"/>totally
							indefensible. A draft of one possible version of a public statement is
								attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d298fn2">Not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. We should seek to get Communist and neutralist governments and
							individuals to advise Pyongyang that trying the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s crew would seriously damage North Korea's
							international standing. Among the channels which we might use for this
							purpose are the Russians, Indonesians, the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, and the North Korean editor in Tokyo.</p>
                        <p>4. Unless we were quite confident that trial of the crew would be merely
							a prelude to their early release, we should probably follow our initial
							public statement almost immediately with publication of a White Paper
							giving a full account of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> case in the
							broad setting of heightened North Korean aggression against the Republic
							of Korea. As you know, such a paper is being prepared.</p>
                        <p>5. We have also considered a number of other possible reactions to the
							contingency in question, but doubt that these reactions would be found
							appropriate or useful. Thus, we do not see how trial of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew would alter our judgment concerning
							the undesirability of various military actions, such as aerial strikes,
							aerial feints, sailing the USS Banner along the North Korean coast,
							blockading the North Korean Navy, etc. We also doubt that a threatening
							deployment of additional U.S. forces to the Korean area would serve any
							useful purpose. Calling up additional reserve units might improve our
							general posture, but could not be expected to have any significant
							impact on the North Korean decision to try the crew.</p>
                        <p>6. Our experience with prisoner problems in Viet-Nam may have some
							relevance to the question at hand. A summary of this experience,
							prepared in <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>, is attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">Not printed.</note>

							Meeting at Panmunjom, March 21, 1968.</p>

                        <p>2. Pak opened with long prepared statement which, in terminology typical
							of previous <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> presentations at these
							meetings, reiterated US position, reviewed “evidence” which <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side had presented, and reiterated <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> position that “We would be able to
							consider return of the crew when you make a proper apology and give an
							assurance on basis of confessions made by crew of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.”</p>
                        <p>3. Pak again insisted that it falls within right of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> to deal with <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and there is room for no third party to meddle. He
							specifically refused to make any proposals or ask any questions
							concerning US proposals as <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had asked at 11th meeting, and added that “We are
							completely unable to find in any of your statements the intention to
							practically solve the issue.” He continued that “Should your side
							persist in its present unwarrantable claim, we cannot but think over the
							meaning of future meetings to be held under such circumstances and we
							will have no interest at all in such meetings.” In two successive
							paragraphs Pak used words “for nothing” and “gratuitous” in describing
							US offer. He concluded opening statement by remarking that US should
							know that “our patience has its limit” and recommending that US “discuss
							businesslike details on the basis of our proposal,” ending with phrase
							that “our side would be prepared to consider any reasonable opinion
							based on moral obligations which would take account of way shown by us
							and which would enable US to solve matter of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew.”</p>
                        <p>4. Since Pak had taken hardline anticipated <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>,<note n="3" xml:id="d299fn3">Reference is to

                            <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> delivered entire

                        <p>5. When Pak received written copy of <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement, he concentrated on element of new
							proposal concerning US preparedness to express regret for any violations
							of orders by USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. He seemed particularly
							interested in portion of that sentence which read “which may have
							resulted in the ship's approach.”</p>
                        <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0703"/>
                        <p>6. After 18-minute pause, during which Pak and his assistants sifted
							through large stack of prepared statements for appropriate reply, Pak
							then delivered statement which consisted of excerpts from some of
							prepared statements plus additional language written on spot. This
							second statement included phrase “if your side has any real concern
							about fate of crew,” which was only hint of threat to punish crew
							apparent at today's meeting.</p>
                        <p>7. Operative paragraphs of Pak's second statement indicated that he
							understood Smith's statement to be an expression of willingness to
							discuss concrete businesslike matters for settlement of issue of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew on basis <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> proposal. Statement continued that if US side agrees to
							Pak's understanding, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side is ready to
							discuss concrete means related to repatriation of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew. Statement continued that Pak believes “we will be
							able to discuss the concrete, businesslike matters at the next meeting
							on basis our proposal,” and concluded, somewhat disjointedly, with
							remark “I have heard your statement, I reserve my right to express later
							our position on it.”</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> merely responded he had
							noted Pak's last statement. Meeting ended with agreement that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> would call next meeting.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Pak obviously changed his tune on

							Inference seems fairly clear. Pak thinks or hopes we are now moving in

                        <p>2. At thirteenth meeting, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							should open with following brief statement:</p>
                        <p>A. At our last meeting I made a further specific proposal. You responded
							by saying that you understood my remarks as an expression of willingness
							to discuss concrete and practical means of settling the matter before us
							on the basis of your earlier proposal. You further indicated that, if
							your understanding was correct, you would be ready at this meeting to
							discuss concrete means of repatriating the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>
                        <p>B. I can confirm that your understanding of my remarks was consistent
							with my intention. The proposal which I laid before you at our last
							meeting was based on careful study of your statements in these private
							meetings and was deliberately cast in the general framework of your
								proposals.<note n="4" xml:id="d300fn4">In telegram 5120, March 25,
								the Embassy in Seoul objected to the language used in paragraphs A
								and B as being “far reaching” and perhaps being on the verge of
								renouncing previous positions. Porter also mentioned the need to
								consider the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> point of view and
								expressed his intention to meet with the President and Foreign
								Minister to make clear that the United States “will not consider
								language which would admit validity of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> 'evidence' or apologize for acts which we consider
								unproven.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR
								N–US) In response the Department of State agreed to delete the
								acknowledgment that the U.S. molded its response to the framework
								suggested by the North Koreans and approved Porter's approach to the
								President and Foreign Minister. (Telegram 135734 to Seoul, March 25;
								ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>C. Since we agree on these matters, I am prepared to move on to the
							concrete and businesslike discussion which you proposed at our last
							meeting. Specifically, I am prepared to discuss the time, place and
							other arrangements for release of the Pueblo's officers and men. I
							propose that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s officers and men be
							turned over to me on March 29<note n="5" xml:id="d300fn5">Since the date
								of the next closed meeting was uncertain, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> was instructed to set a
								date 2 days after the date of the meeting. (Telegram 135542 to
								Seoul, March 23; ibid.)</note> at the Joint Security Area here in
							Panmunjom. Information on the condition of wounded would be appreciated
							so needed medical personnel and transport could be on hand at time of

							place as 82 surviving members of crew are released. At the time of
							release <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0705"/>of the men, I will be
							prepared to sign a receipt incorporating the proposal which I made at
							our last meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. Pak's response is difficult to anticipate and all possibilities cannot
							be covered in these instructions.</p>
                        <p>A. If Pak levels general blast against Smith's proposals at twelfth

							respond in kind, but merely ask Pak to specify in what respect <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s proposals are unsatisfactory
							and to state precisely how Pak would wish to modify them.</p>
                        <p>B. If Pak attempts to twist <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s opening statement into a complete capitulation
							to the North Korean demands, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should correct him by repeating verbatim his
							proposals of twelfth meeting (para 4.E. State 131680).<note n="6" xml:id="d300fn6">See <ref target="#d299fn3">footnote 3, Document

                        </p>
                        <p>C. If Pak rejects <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s
							specific proposals (para 2.C. above) on time and place of release of
							men, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should request

                        <p>D. If Pak asks <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> for
							language of receipt which <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>
							would be prepared to sign, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should read and hand over unsigned copy of the

                        <p>(3) I have taken note of the request of the Senior North Korean

							that no U.S. ship shall in the future come closer than 12 nautical miles
							from North Korea.</p>
                        <p>(4) Based on the foregoing, I</p>
                        <p>(a) acknowledge that the U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was on an
							intelligence-gathering mission when she was seized by the North Korean

                        <p>(b) give assurance that ships of the U.S. Navy will continue to be

                        <p>D [sic]. We are prepared, if doing so would result in release, to omit
							words “may have” in para 4.c. of receipt. We are also prepared to
							consider any other language which does not admit validity of the North

                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Return of ship not mentioned in

							cannot be the subject of the discussion … It will be good if you do not
							mention this question again.”) As soon as men have been returned,
							however, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should

                        <p>5. At close of meeting, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>

                        <p>In course my conversation with <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> today, I noted Soviets had been informed re our
							latest exchange with North Koreans on <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and
							asked him if he could offer any suggestions. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> inquired if we had received North Korean
							reaction to our latest proposal. I said that while North Korean response
							to our proposal for investigation by international body had been
							negative, we had not received any response to our latest suggestion.
								<persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> said Soviets knew
							North Koreans had received our latest views but, of course, did not know
							whether or how they would react to them. Nevertheless, he thought
							perhaps North Koreans might comment on them. In any event, he felt it
							was very good that discussions continued in relatively calm atmosphere.
							He then asserted main difficulties stemmed from our refusal recognize
							facts. <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0707"/>When I pointed out we
							could establish facts by getting the crew back and asking them what
							happened, as well as by having international body conduct an

							pooh-poohed idea by saying only moon or stars knew exactly what the
							facts were. I countered by saying that if international body were to
							find that facts confirmed North Korean story, there would be no problem
							as far as we concerned. I then observed President had been receiving
							letters allegedly written by members of crew, noting this not helpful
							since it stirred up emotions in US. <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> concluded conversation on this subject by

							ignored this and addressed itself at length to position <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had taken at 12th meeting. In

							had made at 12th meeting, reasserted <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							demand for proper apology, [garble] negotiations. At end, Pak said he
							had no objection to Smith's understanding that Pak would call next
							meeting.</p>
                        <p>3. Pak's first (and only substantive) statement opened with accusation
							that it was US, not <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>, which responsible
							for tension, describing <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> intrusion and
							force build-up as part of premeditated maneuvers <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0708"/>to provoke new war. Pak alleged that US
							position was that it perfectly all right for side which had infringed on
							sovereignty of another country to make threats while denying country
							whose sovereignty had been infringed on its right to self defense. This
							he described as “logic of stronger playing upon weaker.” Such methods
							may go down with those suffering with nervous breakdown but not with
							Korean people. Clinging to such logic will make it impossible to settle
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and only bring about unfavorable
							results.</p>
                        <p>4. Pak then alleged that US and not <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> had
							violated understanding regarding secrecy of meetings,<note n="5" xml:id="d302fn5">Reference is to <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s reference at the last meeting to a Radio

                        <p>5. Pak asserted meetings are between reps of two govts. Said <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> has continued “discourteous

                                <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> decided, and the

								under control your side.” (Telegram 5602 from Seoul, April 10, and
								telegram 144339 to Seoul, April 10; both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Pak then said <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> had noted statement
							made at 12th meeting that US prepared to make due apology and give
							assurance when crew of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> is returned. Said,
							however, there are “not a few ambiguous points in US proposals.”
							Referring to US admission that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> had been on
							intelligence-gathering mission at time it was captured, Pak said whole
							world knows that armed spy ship <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was
							engaged in espionage mission from outset. Said question is that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was not only on intelligence-gathering
							mission but was captured in territorial waters of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> while conducting espionage acts; US
							“must take precisely this point into account.”</p>
                        <p>7. Pak noted that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had said
							US Navy ships would continue to be ordered to remain more than 12
							nautical miles from “the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.” Said
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> takes notice of this,
							understanding it as assurance against further violation by US Navy ships
							of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>8. Pak then raised expression of regret for possible intrusion. Said at
							first sight it seems US prepared to bear responsibility for behavior of
							captain and crew and to apologize. In reality, however, US position is
							“nothing else but phrase making, using slippery ambiguous phrases,”
							which under careful examination shows US wants to express regret for
							“certain unknown hypothetical action.” “Is there anything in it? <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0709"/>Nothing.” With such phrase
							making US cannot conceal obvious crime or deceive anybody. “Don't you
							think that if you want to settle the matter you must among others make
							an apology properly at least?” Only then can so-called US proposal be
							taken into consideration as basis for practical settlement.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> responded that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> not approaching question in businesslike
							manner. Said <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> had not been specific
							about desired changes in US proposal. Asked whether NKorean side had
							specific proposal in writing which meeting could address. Pak responded
							that his first statement was businesslike matter for practical
							settlement of question.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> said US had taken note
							of all that had been said and published and had made reasonable proposal
							under circumstances. If Pak had no written proposal to table, could he
							come to next meeting with one? Stated it Pak's turn to call next
							meeting. Pak reiterated that his first statement offered businesslike
							suggestion for settlement and recommended <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> seriously study it. Stated no objection to
							understanding <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> would call next
								meeting.<note n="7" xml:id="d302fn7">Since the Department of State
								expected Pak to make similar remarks at the next meeting, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> was instructed to draw on
								past instructions as appropriate. The Department provided guidance
								covering various contingencies. (Telegram 139480 to Seoul, March 30;
								ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Pak's main statement, delivered in
							firm but not particularly harsh manner, supports our belief that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> is attempting obtain unambiguous apology
							from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> Govt for intrusion, espionage, and commission of
							hostile acts. Believe this is first time at closed meetings that Pak has
							specifically stated <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was captured in <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territorial waters.</p>
                        <p>12. Apparent willingness to accept US language on assurance (para 7) is
							probably false lure. Pak's statements today also notable for absence of
							threat to try crew; however, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> would
							probably feel that crew's letters over past week have covered this
							adequately.</p>
                        <p>13. Pak will speak first at next meeting, presumably addressing himself
							to whatever <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> can make of second para of
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s first statement
							today and possibly to nature of receipt <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> mentioned in third para, since Pak and his
							assistant appeared interested when <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> mentioned (para 9 above) specific changes in US
							position.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Today's lengthy meeting (2 hrs, 15 min) resulted in stalemate, with
							Pak rejecting latest US proposal along lines he took at 13th meeting and
							reiterating NKorean demand for “proper apology”.<note n="3" xml:id="d303fn3">Telegram 5641 from Seoul, April 11, transmitted the
								verbatim text of the meeting. (Ibid.)</note> Only significant new
							item to emerge on NKorean side was demand that <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> provide written document or
							documents embodying NKorean proposal. In his presentation Pak made no
							obvious threat with regard to fate of crew, but again NKoreans doubtless
							feel that many letters from crew which Pyongyang has broadcast since
							13th meeting adequately cover this point.</p>
                        <p>2. Pak's opening statement was devoted to denial that NKoreans had failed
							to state what specific changes should be made in US proposal and to
							assertion that NKoreans themselves had made concrete proposal to settle
							issue. He said “our side has clearly indicated that question of
							returning crew may be considered if your side makes apology it deserves
							to make on basis of confessions of crew of Pueblo which was captured
							while perpetrating espionage and hostile acts after intruding into
								<gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> territorial waters and assures
							that your side will not commit again hostile acts against <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.” He complained that by its proposal
							US was merely attempting to avoid responsibility for proven espionage
							and was attempting to treat intrusions as hypothetical acts. He
							concluded prepared statement by twice referring to necessity that US
							side present appropriate documents and “write clearly and submit to us
							details of apology,” instead of asking for written proposal from North
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>3. As opening portion his response, RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> used language provided paras 4A, B, and C of Ref
							(A). He followed this with statement from paras 3B (1) and (2) of Ref
								(B).<note n="4" xml:id="d303fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s comments centered
								on the U.S. proposal and on the position of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> when captured.</note> He concluded by offering to
							provide Pak immediately with copy of draft receipt which <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0711"/>brought to 13th meeting, if Pak would request it, and
							by asserting that unless Pak prepared to accept this proposal he must
							provide in writing receipt Pak visualizes.</p>
                        <p>4. After pause of 4 minutes, during which Pak sifted through various
							prepared statements and finally wrote his response, Pak revived old
							language concerning “unwarrantedness” of US claim and rejecting US
							position as basis for settlement. He reiterated refusal to provide
							written draft of documentation desire by North Korea, saying that basis
							for settlement could be easily provided only if US takes into
							consideration North Korean proposal and presents document apologizing
							for <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> acts in proper manner. He then again
							“seriously warned” <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> about
							discourteous act of describing <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> as
							“North Korea”. He concluded this statement by reserving right to answer
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement of
							today.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> responded with language
							from para 7, Ref (A),<note n="5" xml:id="d303fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> reminded Pak that
								after 14 meetings the North Korean side has still not offered a
								proposal to resolve the crisis.</note> again pressed for written
							proposal from NKoreans and acknowledged he would call next meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. Pak responded with another request for appropriate document from US
							side.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Issue has boiled down to which side
							will submit written document, with both fully aware that anything
							submitted by one will not be acceptable to other. NKoreans clearly
							anticipate additional meetings, however, since they said as much during
							this session, and were also overheard saying in Korean that they would
							hold one of their prepared statements for next meeting. In view their
							growing insistence that North Korea be referred to as <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>, however, there is some feeling here
							that they may not respond to call for closed meeting unless request is
							addressed to representative of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.
							Heretofore we have simply addressed request to senior member their
							side.</p>

                        <p>1. In view of Pak's long delay in calling fourteenth meeting, and in
							order to avoid appearing eager, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should wait until April 19 and then propose
							private meeting on April 22.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should open meeting
							with following statement:</p>
                        <p>A. At our last meeting, I suggested that, if you cannot accept the
							proposals which I have made for settling the problem before us, you give
							me a concrete proposal of your own in writing. I cannot understand why
							you are unwilling to do so, but in an effort to get on with the business
							of these talks, I have brought with me a draft of the receipt which I am
							prepared to sign at the time of the release of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s officers and men. (At this point <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should read and hand Pak draft
							receipt set forth in para. 3.D., ref B.)</p>
                        <p>B. As you can see, this draft receipt includes the three-point proposal
							which I first made at the twelfth meeting. The draft receipt also takes
							proper notice of the statements and evidence which you put forth at our
							past meetings. I believe that it provides a fair and reasonable basis
							for agreeing upon the immediate release of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s crew.</p>
                        <p>C. I trust that you fully appreciate the effort which we have made to be
							responsive to the views which you have expressed in these meetings. You
							must clearly understand, however, that we cannot go beyond the substance
							of the draft receipt.</p>
                        <p>D. I must remind you that your side proposed that the problem created by
							the seizure of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> be solved through
							meetings of the Senior Members of the Military Armistice Commission. We
							accepted this proposal in good faith, hoping to reach a speedy agreement
							on the release of the ship and its crew. After fourteen meetings without
							agreement or concrete, reasonable proposals from your side, we are
							entitled to question your seriousness in proposing use of this
							channel.</p>
                        <p>3. In responding to Pak's remarks, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> is authorized to repeat as appropriate any
							statements in his previous instructions.</p>
                        <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0713"/>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should not raise
							question of which side is to set time of next meeting. If subject comes
							up, however, <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> should agree
							that it is Pak's turn.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. Purpose of paras. 2.D., and 4. is

                        <p>2. RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> opened with
							statement contained reftel and handed Pak draft of receipt as
							instructed.</p>
                        <p>3. Pak responded with reference to <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statements at 14th meeting, characterizing
							request for return of crew on basis US proposal as “shameless demand”
							and characterizing proposal itself as “nothing but practice of
							phrase-making to deceive others.” Referring to legality of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> activities under 1907 Hague Convention,
							Pak said US side can never justify criminal acts of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> under international law. Continued with usual charge
							that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was armed spy ship seized while
							conducting espionage after intrusion into territorial waters of <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss> on mission to detect important
							secrets and that crew are spies caught in “flagrent delict” (sic).
							Charged that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> disguised itself as
							“oceanographic electronic research ship,” stealthily intruded into
							territorial waters, and tried to hide its identity by responding that it
							was “hydrographer” <pb n="682" xml:id="pg_682" facs="0714"/>in answer to
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> naval signals. Recited list of
							evidence which <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> has provided and
							repeated charge that US attempting to deny “grim reality under all sorts
							of unreasonable pretexts.” Said such attitude is inhumane act by which
							US side abandons moral duty to grant, by apologizing, petition of crew
							to enable them return US as early as possible and to realize fervent
							desire of waiting families and relatives. Pak then offered to show film
							which he said would actually show whether confessions of crew had been
							made under duress. After again deriding US proposal, Pak said it would
							be miscalculation if US side wants to get something on basis thereof.
							Ended by saying <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side had put forth
							concrete proposal for practical solution and fact that question remains
							unsettled is because of US persistence in maintaining unreasonable
							position.</p>
                        <p>4. Foregoing read from prepared statement. Pak then added statement,
							which he had written following <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s presentation, acknowledging that he had received
							draft receipt, commenting that there no difference between receipt and
							“so-called proposal” of US side, and ending “however, I reserve right to
							answer at next meeting to the draft as well as to your statement
							today.”</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> responded that he did
							not desire to view film but asked Pak to give or lend him copy. He then
							stated that US side had, as Pak requested at last meeting, written out
							an appropriate document which would make it possible to settle issue. If
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side did not find this
							satisfactory, it incumbent upon Pak to present document which <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> would consider acceptable. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> then proposed conclusion of
							meeting.</p>
                        <p>6. During next interval Pak anxiously asked his assistant whether
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had mentioned
							responsibility for calling next meeting. When he received copy of
								<persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName>'s statement, he
							immediately looked at it to see whether mention made of next
							meeting.</p>
                        <p>7. Pak then reiterated that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side had
							made perfectly clear what kind of apology has to be made to have crew
							returned and that it completely US side's business to make that apology
							and submit document in writing. He indicated unwillingness or inability
							to lend copy of film and asked again whether <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> wanted to see it “at this
							place.”</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> replied he did not wish
							to see film and again requested copy. Pak responded he had no intention
							“to positively ask” <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> to
							view film and repeated that film fully shows that crew confessed
							voluntarily under no restriction and is receiving humanitarian treatment

							issue of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew. Asked Woodward to make

                            <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> responded he senior

							United States Govt with full authority to discuss release of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its crew. Pak noted that “you are

                        <p>3. Pak then read prepared statement, first portion of which dedicated to
							rejection of draft receipt which RAdm <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> had presented at fifteenth meeting. He said draft
							fails to reflect any consideration of Pak's previous statements
							explaining in detail way in which document would be prepared to enable
							return of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew, and that draft vividly
							reflects unjust position by which US side intends to persist in denying
							crimes committed by <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and to refuse to bear
							responsibility for them. Said “we cannot but be surprised” at
							presentation of draft document devoid of any substance and cannot but
							doubt real intention of your side. After saying that it <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> “consistent position” that question of
							return of crew “may be considered” only when your side makes “proper”
							apology, Pak continued that “in order to make document of apology and
							assurance which your side submits worthy of our consideration, it should
							be written as follows”:</p>
                        <p>“The Govt of the United States of America,</p>
                        <p>Acknowledging the validity of the confessions of the crew of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and of the documents of evidence produced
							by the representative of the Govt of the Democratic People's Republic of
							Korea to the effect that the ship, which was seized by the self-defence
							measures of the naval vessels of the Korean People's Army in the
							territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on many
							occasions and conducted espionage activities of spying out important
							military and state secrets of the Democratic People's Republic of
							Korea,</p>
                        <p>Shoulders full responsibility and solemnly apologizes for the grave acts
							of espionage committed by the US ship against the Democratic People's
							Republic of Korea after intruding into the territorial waters of the
							Democratic People's Republic of Korea,</p>
                        <p>And gives firm assurance that no US ships will intrude again in future
							into the territorial waters of the Democratic People's Republic of
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the Govt of the United States of America earnestly requests
							that the Govt of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, taking into
							consideration the fact that the former crew members of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> confiscated by the Democratic People's
							Republic of Korea side have confessed honestly to their crimes and
							petitioned the Govt of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for
							leniency as well as the above mentioned apology and assurance of the
							Govt of the United States of America, deal leniently with the crew
							members.”</p>
                        <p>4. Pak continued that if your side submits such document, means for
							settlement of question of crews will be easily arranged and preparations
							of receipt will not be big problem. Pak advised serious study of this
							statement and that <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							come to next meeting with such prepared document.</p>
                        <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0717"/>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> responded with
							language of first two sentences para four <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>, but reserved use of language from this para
							beginning with word “specifically” as probably more useful at later
								meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d306fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> emphasized he had
								“consulted intensively with responsible officials in Washington on
								problem created by illegal seizure of USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>,” and assured Pak that all positions presented to
								date by <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> reflected the
								“policy of the United States Government.” <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> chose not to inform the
								North Koreans that the draft receipt given them at the last meeting
								“represents in substance furthest that United States Government is
								prepared to go.” (Telegram 151745 to Seoul, April 23; ibid.)</note>
							He also said he noted that contents of document Pak submitted today
							differed greatly from fair and reasonable proposals submitted by our
							side and that it would be necessary for him to submit Pak's document to
							higher authority.</p>
                        <p>6. Pak replied with ad hoc statement that his proposal today is just and
							reasonable one which can make it possible to settle matter practically,
							again recommending serious study and return to next meeting with such
							document in hand. Pak then proposed recess, and <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Pak's manner at today's meeting was
							mildest yet observed according to <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s staff, and in reading his prepared statement
							Pak made definite effort to use persuasive tone. There was no hint of
							any threat to crew.</p>
                        <p>8. We will probably not be able to ascertain without further probing
							whether position Pak put forward in his draft document today represents
							starting point for further negotiations or something close to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> final position.<note n="6" xml:id="d306fn6">In response to Porter's suggestions, the Department
								of State authorized him to brief the South Koreans on the proposal,
								but to refrain from giving them a copy of the documents “unless they
								press hard for them.” (Telegram 7088 from Seoul and telegram 160538
								to Seoul, both May 8; both ibid.) After the briefing on May 9,
									<persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> reported being
								“compelled to give Pak written copy of the draft receipt” <persName corresp="#p_SRAJV1">Smith</persName> presented at the 15th
								meeting and anticipated receiving a request for the text of the
								North Korean proposal. (Telegram 7119 from Seoul, May 9; ibid.)
								Shortly thereafter the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
								submitted an aide memoire reminding the United States of its
								previous assurances not to sign “a helicopter-type document in
								return for the release of the crew.” (Telegram 7279 from Seoul, May
								17, and airgram A–594 from Seoul, May 20; both ibid.)</note> In
							essence, document is apology from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
							and entreaty that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> deal leniently with
							crew. It does not even take form of request for release. Judging from
							language of Pak's presentation <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> has in
							mind two documents: one of nature tabled today to be submitted first and
							probably exploited for propaganda purposes, followed by receipt which
							would probably incorporate much of language contained in basic document
							and which would be negotiated subsequently. Question of who might sign
							either apology or receipt, or even whether signature on basic document
							might be required, is left open.</p>
                        <p>9. There was nothing in Pak's presentation today to indicate that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> is prepared now to discuss details or
							timing of crew release. Pak <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0718"/>
							very carefully made clear that basic document tabled today is de- signed
							only to permit <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> to “give consideration”
							to details of eventual return.</p>
                        <p>10. Byplay at beginning of meeting again emphasizes <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> concern over govt to govt aspect of
							meetings and fact that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> considers it is
							negotiating on crew only and not on ship itself. We do not believe Pak
							has ever before used word “confiscated” when referring to ship.</p>
                        <p>11. Although question of who would call next meeting is also left open,
							it seems clear from Pak's statements about <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> coming to next meeting with appropriate
							document and fact that Pak has tabled concrete proposal, that Koreans
							find it to their advantage to continue and prolong these sessions and
							probably intend to do so.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that the United States was very concerned about the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> affair.<note n="2" xml:id="d307fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAM1">Gromyko</persName> discussed the matter in
								Moscow on June 5. Each side repeated the positions set forth by
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Kuznetsov.
								(Telegram 4114 from Moscow, June 5; ibid.)</note> The United States
							has gone as far as it is possible for it to go. He said that we could
							not apologize for something that we do not think that we actually did,
							i.e., enter North Korean territorial <pb n="687" xml:id="pg_687" facs="0719"/>waters. He hoped that we could obtain Soviet assistance
							in bringing this question to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Continuing, the Secretary said we were also concerned about the
							infiltration of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> by North Korea
							and statements by North Korea suggesting possible resumption of
							hostilities toward the South. He asked for Soviet influence with
							Pyongyang to keep things cool: the situation could become explosive. Mr.
								<persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> added that the U.S.
							was ready to turn over the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> to
							any country with which we have relations, including the Soviet Union,
							pending an objective review of what had happened.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said that he could not answer at the moment and could only
							express the hope that the problem would be solved. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the North Koreans
							had shown the Soviets a movie of the crew in which they had made
							statements which left the impression that the crew supported the North
							Korean view of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident. The Secretary
							said that if the crew actually said to the U.S. Government what they
							were alleged to have said to the North Koreans, then the U.S. would be
							ready to apologize; but we could not place credence in any statements
							which had been made by the crew under duress.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated in measured terms that if North Korea attacks South
							Korea, the United States will react with “maximum violence”.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said that the North Koreans had given the Soviets evidence that
							South Korea had been infiltrating North Korea and that they, the
							Soviets, were concerned about this. The Secretary replied that he felt
							it important that the Soviets and the United States ascertain
							independently and as objectively as they can what the facts really are
							on both sides and that the two governments should keep in touch with
							this matter. He thought that both governments should work to cool down
							the Korean situation on both sides.</p>
                        <p>Kuznetsov said that the Soviets strongly favor detente in Korea and that
							we should move against any tension or aggravation of the situation. The
							Secretary pointed out that a step toward this would be the release of
							the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>.</p>

                        <p>If the North Koreans were to accept this procedure they would, of course,

							statement contained Ref (A). Pak started to take notes while <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss> interpreter was reading Korean
							version of <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s statement
							but soon abandoned note taking and adopted air of boredom and

							began taking notes when <gloss target="#t_UNCMAC1">UNCMAC</gloss>
							interpreter reached that portion of <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s statement discussed Ref (B).</p>
                        <p>3. After pause of about six minutes, during which he looked carefully at
							latter portion of <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s
							statement and underlined several sentences including that discussed Ref
							(B), Pak chose one of several prepared statements to read in response.
							This statement was general expression of unhappiness with fact that US
							side had reviewed its previous position and had not come to today's
							meeting with document of apology and assurance along lines that which
							Pak had presented at sixteenth meeting. He said US failure to do so
							clearly shows US is not concerned about fate of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew and has no intention of settling question at these
							meetings. He reiterated that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>-proposed
							document was based on “grim reality” of crimes committed by <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, pointed out responsibilities US must
							assume as organizer of crime, and stated that to settle question US must
							write document of apology and assurance as demanded and present it to
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side. He then closed with <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0723"/>statement that he would comment
							on <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s statement of
							today at next meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d309fn5">The results of this

                        <p>1. Meeting began 1100 hrs local June 27 and ended 1225.<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">Telegram 174524 to Seoul, May 31, transmitted
									<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s instructions
								for this meeting; telegram 8221 from Seoul, June 27, transmitted the
								verbatim text of this meeting. (Both ibid.)</note> Pak's manner was
							unoffensive and his language soft and obviously intended to be
							persuasive. Substance of his statements, however, was unyielding with no
							hint of accommodation. In brief, he reiterated theme of seventeenth
							meeting that if US wanted crew returned, it must admit criminal acts and
							apologize for them.</p>
                        <p>2. Pak flatly rejected receipt proposed by US at last meeting as basis
							for negotiating return of crew, and returned to demand for proper
							document as submitted earlier by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side.
							Equally adamant on use of any third party. He noted we had both agreed
							that <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was on intelligence gathering
							mission. Essential points, however, were for US <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0724"/> side to admit that ship had entered
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> territorial waters and had carried
							out hostile acts. At later point he noted that admission had to be
							accompanied by apology and assurances that acts would not be repeated.
							Pak noted that return of crew could then be discussed, implying
							procedure similar to that of helicopter pilots. Speaking in what US
							participants described as quite, persuasive manner, he said that if
							document of apology and assurance were submitted “You need not worry
							much about the delivery of your crew as there are precedents.”</p>
                        <p>3. Pak reopened possibility of some sort of reprisal against crew saying
							at one point they should be punished for their hostile acts and at
							another that because of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
							procrastination, crew might have to pay appropriate price. Both
							statements were conditional and were not major part of his
							presentation.</p>
                        <p>4. At seventeenth meeting <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> had indirectly and in low key indicated US
							might make negotiations public. Pak today made veiled reference to this
							by saying US would have more to lose by such action than <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Pak refused to comment directly either on health of Bucher or welfare
							of crew.<note n="3" xml:id="d310fn3">In the wake of unconfirmed rumors
								about the health and welfare of the crew, including the alleged
								death of another crewman and the reported suicide of Bucher,
									<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> was also
								instructed to request specific information from the North Koreans
								about the men's physical and mental condition that, despite repeated
								requests by the senior member and the ICRC, had not been provided
								since they were taken captive. (Telegrams 182296, June 13, and
								183139, June 14, to Seoul; both ibid.)</note> On Bucher he said he
							had no knowledge of rumor we had cited and that he did not feel it
							necessary to clarify every rumor.<note n="4" xml:id="d310fn4">Prior to
								this meeting and on instructions from the Department of State, a
								formal inquiry was made through the <gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss> on Bucher's status, but no reply to the request for
								information had been received. (Telegrams 188397, June 21, and
								190934, June 26, to Seoul, and telegram 8186 from Seoul, June 27;
								all ibid.) In a subsequent meeting at which the UNC presented
								another letter on the subject, the U.S. <gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss> was informed by the North Korean <gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss> that the matter must be handled
								through the Senior Members meetings. (Telegram 194259 to Seoul, July
								1, and telegrams 8337 and 8348 from Seoul, both July 3; all
								ibid.)</note> With reference to crew, he referred US to his Feb 2
							statement and, upon being pressed by <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>, repeated statements he had made re Bucher.
							Upon again being pressed, he said we should not believe the rumor and if
							we were really interested in crew welfare to submit document of apology
							and assurance. Pak's statements were sufficiently ambiguous to admit of
							interpretation either way. While evidence is very weak, we inclined to
							think he was saying Bucher and crew all right. We note that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s did inform us of Hodge's death, although
							they probably aware we knew he wounded.</p>
                        <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0725"/>
                        <p>6. Pak made clear he wishes to keep meetings going and referred twice to
							next meeting.<note n="5" xml:id="d310fn5">The next meeting was held on
								July 10, 11–11:45 a.m. KST. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s instructions for that meeting centered on
								requesting information about the health and welfare of the crew and
								addressing the issue of North Korean assurances of simultaneous
								release. (Telegram 196384 to Seoul, July 3; ibid.) Telegram 8475
								from Seoul, July 10, transmitted a summary of the meeting, and
								telegram 8474 from Seoul, July 10, transmitted the verbatim text of
								the meeting. (Both ibid.)</note> From repeated references to crew
							welfare and reiteration of possible punishment Pak aware US concern for
							crew safety remains strong bargaining counter on <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side.</p>

							Under Secretary's request.<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">A talking paper
								had been prepared in advance of this meeting. (Memorandum from
								Godley and Springsteen to <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, July 17; ibid.) The meeting had been
								delayed by <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>'s
								absence from Washington and by the onset of the Czech crisis. That
								situation, in turn, delayed the implementation of measures to prod
								the North Koreans to call the next Senior Members meeting.
								(Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to
									<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>, July 30, and
								memorandum from Godley to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, August 9; both ibid.)</note> After greeting the
							Ambassador and presenting him with commemorative photographs of the
								<gloss target="#t_NPT1">NPT</gloss> signing ceremony, the Under
							Secretary began by expressing our deep concern over the lack of progress
							at Panmunjom. He noted that more than 35 days had passed since the <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0726"/>last joint meeting and
							questioned the purpose of continuing these meetings in view of the lack
							of movement. The Under Secretary noted that the North Korean demands,
							i.e., that we admit the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was engaged in
							espionage, admit intrusion into North Korean waters, apologize and give
							assurances against any repetition, remain unchanged.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary stated that the US Government is certain the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> did not enter North Korean territorial
							waters. We assume that the Soviet Government would not wish us to
							consider the activity of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> as espionage.
							As to assurances, this posed no problem since we did not intrude and had
							no intention of ever doing so.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was becoming more
							of a public and political issue in the United States. On his recent
							California trip, the first question asked was always what were we doing
							to get the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew back. He called the
							Ambassador's attention to the fact that the biggest ovation Mr. Nixon
							received during his acceptance address was for his reference to doing
							something about the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> will undoubtedly be an issue in the Presidential
							campaign and the American public would associate the Soviet Union with
							North Korea. This type of agitation and oratory could not help but have
							an effect on our relations with the Soviet Union. While we could improve
							our public image by saying more, this would only increase demands for
							action.</p>
                        <p>Referring to a possible solution, the Under Secretary reminded the
							Ambassador that we have told the North Koreans we would sign an
							appropriately amended version of the document they tabled on May 8
							acknowledging receipt of the crew, if we would simultaneously receive
							custody of the crew. However, we have received no response to this
							suggestion.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> replied that
							the Soviets had received a different version of the facts from the North
							Koreans. The Under Secretary suggested Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> examine the evidence himself.
							He was confident that if the Ambassador did so he too would be convinced
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> made no intrusion. Ambassador
								<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked why the
							Soviets should doubt the North Koreans. The Under Secretary replied that
							he personally knew the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was under strict
							orders not to go within 13 miles of the North Korean coast. It had good
							navigators and there was no reason to believe the Captain would violate
							his orders or make such a navigational error.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary then asked the Ambassador whether, under similar
							circumstances, the Soviet Union would apologize for something it knew it
							had not done. If we had violated North Korean waters, we would, of
							course, apologize. We did so under similar circumstances when our
							aircraft violated Soviet air space over the Kurile Islands. The Under
							Secretary stated he would not hesitate to send another ship <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0727"/>within the 12-mile limit and apologize
							for the intrusion if he thought it would prove this point.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> commented that
							perhaps this was a big country-little country problem and that the North
							Koreans clearly do not view it in the same light as would a large
							nation.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary repeated his sincere conviction, based on all the
							evidence which he had personally examined, that there had been no
							intrusion. He noted again that there was no operational reason for the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> to approach within 12 miles, that
							navigational errors were unlikely and that if it had intruded we would
							have apologized.</p>
                        <p>To this Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again
							stated that his Government had no reason to doubt the North Korean
							statement that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was in their waters,
							and mentioned that several of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crewmen
							had admitted this. The Under Secretary observed that the statements made
							by some crew members could not be verified since no one but North
							Koreans have been allowed to see them.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary then asked the Ambassador for his advice on how to
							resolve the problem, observing that the Soviet Union has influence with
							the North Koreans while we do not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> added that under
							international law and common maritime practice, if a ship of another
							nation crosses your 12-mile limit, the practice was to warn it and
							escort it out of your waters. The Ambassador replied that all this
							depends upon your point of view. Different-sized nations hold different
							opinions on such subjects. The Soviet Union has made its views clear to
							North Korea. As to the facts, there had been no Soviets present who
							could verify them.</p>
                        <p>To the Under Secretary's question whether his Government objected to a
							third country inquiry, the Ambassador replied that this was all right
							with the Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>When the Under Secretary asked why no one had been allowed to see or talk
							to the crew, the Ambassador commented that there was much bitterness
							against the United States in North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he was really in no position to give advice on
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> problem.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked why the North Koreans should want to continue
							holding the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he could not speak for
							them. The Under Secretary emphasized that the North Koreans had not even
							indicated whether they would return the crew if an apology were made.
							The Ambassador remarked that he was under the impression they had
							indicated to the US they would. The Under Secretary stated that they had
							never told us that they would do so.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary repeated his question whether the Soviets wanted the
							type of legitimate intelligence collection the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0728"/>engaged in
							to be considered espionage. The Ambassador said the Soviet ships do not
							do this within territorial waters. The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							issue, he said, always comes back to the question of fact. The North
							Koreans say one thing, while the United States says the opposite. The
							Soviet Government does not wish to be in the position of verifying the
							facts; moreover, the North Koreans know very well the Soviet
							Government's views.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked what the United States is prepared to do to
							obtain the crew's release. The Under Secretary reiterated that we will
							not admit to espionage nor admit that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							violated North Korean waters. We will admit the intelligence gathering
							mission of the vessel and will give assurances against future intrusion.
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> again
							remarked that the central point is whether or not the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> did intrude.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
							to put himself in our position. They are holding our crew—under
							conditions that could lead our men to say almost anything. We are
							convinced we did not intrude. Assuming we admitted our “guilt” and
							apologized, the American system being what it is the crew would disavow
							its guilt upon its return and the United States Government would be made
							out a liar.</p>
                        <p>To the Under Secretary's query as to whether the solution might be our
							receipting an amended version of the North Korean draft apology
							document—one that did not admit to espionage—<persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated he did not think that was what the North
							Koreans wanted.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador, however, said he would report our view to his
							Government.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary gave the Ambassador a memorandum summarizing the
							views he had expressed and again asked for the Soviet Government's
							suggestions on this matter. He showed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> a copy of the draft North
							Korean apology statement. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked what it was in it that we could not
							accept. The Under Secretary pointed out the espionage, intrusion and
							apology demands, and noted that, in fact, it was only a request for
							leniency toward men we would be admitting were guilty of espionage and
							asked if the Soviet Union would sign that kind of a paper.</p>

                        <p>The talks have, for some time, been at an impasse. The North Koreans
							insist on our admitting, and apologizing for, espionage and intrusion
							into their territorial waters. Then, they say, we “need not worry about
							the release of the crew.”</p>
                        <p>We have refused to admit espionage or to apologize for acts we are
							morally certain we did not commit. Various forms of conditional apology
							(e.g., we regret any intrusion that may have occurred) have been

                        <p>Consequently, by authorization of the President on May 18, we began to
							explore the possibility of General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> writing across the face of a document presented
							by the North Koreans an acknowledgment of the receipt of the crew and
							signing it. If the North Koreans accepted this they would presumably
							claim that we had signed their piece of paper and we would say that we
							had signed only what <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							had written. We tried to explain this ploy in detail to the North
							Koreans through an Australian contact in Tokyo, but we are not sure
							whether this really ever got through to Pyongyang or whether Pak knows
							about it.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>
							reviewed the situation on August 13 with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> without mentioning the
							over-write plan. There has been no feedback from this demarche. At our
							request, a number of other governments have approached the North Koreans
							but were given the standard response: “Let the Americans apologize.”</p>
                        <p>President Park has been kept informed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">

                        <p>The Twentieth Closed Meeting on August 29 produced an interesting

								of the meeting, which lasted from 11 a.m. to 12:47 p.m. KST.
								Telegram 9476 from Seoul, August 29, transmitted the verbatim text
								of the meeting. (All ibid.)</note> General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> repeatedly tried to get
							General Pak to say yes or no to our latest formulation: “If I were to
							acknowledge receipt of the crew on a document whose language was
							satisfactory to you, would you simultaneously release the crew?” On the
							third go-round <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> said,
							“If you were to simultaneously release the crew, I would acknowledge
							receipt of a document whose language was satisfactory to you.” Pak
							pounced on this, “noted that your side is ready to sign our document of
							apology and assurance”, and promised a further comment later. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> said, “Your statement
							contains language I did not use,” and recessed.</p>
                        <p>The question is what instructions to give <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> for the next meeting.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that we should continue to try to pin Pak down to release
							of the crew simultaneously with any signing. It is unlikely, however,
							that he would do more than agree to release the crew within <pb n="699" xml:id="pg_699" facs="0731"/>a day or two after a document was
							signed. Are we willing to take the risk of signing and relying on North
							Korean promise to deliver the crew? How long could we wait?</p>
                        <p>In the case of the helicopter pilots (1964), the North Koreans demanded
							and got our signature on a receipt—admitting espionage—without any
							promise of when the pilots would be released. They then immediately
							offered to release the next day and they did so. They keep saying at
							Panmunjom “There is a precedent. What more assurance do you want?” We
							feel that Pak is most unlikely to agree to actual release simultaneous
							with signature, and that 24 or 48 hours between signature and release
							would probably not hurt but that we need a commitment that it would be
							no longer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That we accept up to a 48 hour
							interval.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that Pak might agree to simultaneous release and bring the
							crew to Panmunjom, but would reject a document if it consisted only of
							an over-write with <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s
							signature, and threaten to take the crew away again. Under those
							conditions, should <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							then sign the document the North Koreans want?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is probable that an officer of
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s rank and
							experience would sign even though his instructions did not authorize
							such action, unless he were expressly forbidden to do so.</p>
                        <p>We had planned, if Pak agrees to simultaneously, to tell him precisely
							what we would do, i.e. over-write but not sign the actual North Korean
							draft. Pak might well reject this ploy if he understood exactly what we
							planned to do. What then should be our position?</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That we do not spell out our
							proposal further. The ploy might just work, and explanation is likely to
							kill it.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the North Koreans would release only part of the
							crew, for example, all of the enlisted men but not the officers. Would
							we sign either the over-write or the North Korean apology in order to
							get part of the men back?</p>
                        <p>It would be difficult to reveal nothing to the press and Congress on
							their debriefings, difficult to prevent leaks, yet difficult to say
							anything of what we learned from those released without hurting those
							still held. And it would seem logical for the North Koreans to hold some
							back as hostages to deter our denouncing whatever “receipt” we may sign,
							to prevent us from issuing a White Paper, etc. Yet obviously we cannot
							refuse to accept a part of the crew unless the terms are utterly
							outrageous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> If we can get back all the

                            <hi rend="italic">Recommendation:</hi> That we wait until after

                        <p>Decisions on these points are needed as soon as possible, since <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> needs instructions in case

							Closed Meeting at Panmunjom Sept 17, 1968. Reference: Seoul 9475.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">Telegram 9475 from Seoul, August 29,

                        <p>1. Meeting began 1100 hours Sep 17 and ended 1452 hours local time.<note n="3" xml:id="d313fn3">Telegram 9890 from Seoul, September 17,
								transmitted the verbatim text of this meeting. (Ibid.)</note> Length
							of meeting was due to persistent efforts on part of both sides to probe
							position of other side, with long pauses required to write out
							statements.</p>
                        <p>2. Some clarification of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> position
							emerged from General Woodward's questioning of Pak. The North Korean
							side went on record as stating flatly that the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> would be released if the US would sign and
							submit the North Korean document of May 8. Second position of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> was that if US side agreed to sign and
							submit May 8 document the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side would
							be prepared to discuss the specifics of the release of the crew and the
							signing of the document.</p>
                        <p>3. At no time was General Pak willing to reply directly to General
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s questions
							regarding simultaneous release. Presumption <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0733"/>is that simultaneous release is one of specific details
							which would be discussed after US agreed to sign May 8 document. We note
							that Pak made no effort to find out what we meant by “acknowledge
							receipt.” Again the presumption is that this is one of specific details
							to be settled after US agreement to sign.</p>
                        <p>4. We also note that Pak did not at this meeting mention existing
							precedent in connection with release of crew. Failure to mention
							precedent may have no particular significance as again, all questions of
							this nature presumably included amongst details to be settled later.</p>
                        <p>5. General Pak made several efforts to find out if by language acceptable
							to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side, we meant their May 8
							document. These efforts frustrated by General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>.</p>
                        <p>6. Typical statement of Pak setting forth first position mentioned
							paragraph 2 above was as follows: “I clearly stated that our side will
							send back to your side the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							only if your side signs the document presented by our side at the
							meeting of May 8 last.”</p>
                        <p>7. Second position <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side mentioned para
							2 above was expressed by Pak in following language: “I have also stated
							that if your side indicates its willingness to sign the document
							presented by our side on May 8 detailed matters concerning signing of
							the document and return of the crew will be discussed.”</p>
                        <p>8. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> raised
							question of visit to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> of father of
							Angelo Strano.<note n="4" xml:id="d313fn4">The parents of crew member
								Strano met with <persName corresp="#p_FBA1">Benjamin
									Fleck</persName>, Country Director for Korea, in Washington on
								July 17, at which time Mr. Strano voiced his desire to go to North
								Korea to attempt to free his son and his expectation that the U.S.
								Government would arrange his entry. The matter was discussed with
									<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> and brought to
									<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s attention.
								(Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> to

								Department agreed to submit his request to the North Koreans, and

								do so in his instructions for the 20th closed meeting. (Telegram
								210445 to Seoul, July 27; ibid.)</note> General Pak flatly refused
							to deal with question stating that “this is not the place to arrange for
							issuance of a visa.”</p>
                        <p>9. Meeting closed with General Pak asking for reply from US side at next
							meeting to question of whether US prepared to sign May 8 document.

                        <p>As requested, at Tab A is a redraft—omitting the lurid adjectives and the
							paragraph requesting leniency for the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							crew—of the May 8 document the North Koreans want us to sign. (The
							original is at Tab B.)<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">Attached but not
								printed, see <ref target="#d306">Document 306</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>My personal view is that any move to tamper with the document now would
							be a serious mistake.</p>
                        <p>We have been following a two-pronged course in our negotiations at
							Panmunjom:</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">Don't give an inch</hi>. This is the explicit approach
							we have taken in the closed meetings. We have probed for any flexibility
							in the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> position, without giving any
							flat assurances of our own willingness to compromise.</p>
                        <p>—<hi rend="italic">What compromise can we reach and repudiate after the
								crew is returned?</hi> Implicit in much that we have said, however
							(including a clandestine Australian contact with the North Koreans), is
							a hint that we would be willing to overwrite (in lieu of a simple
							signature) on the May 8 document an acknowledgement of receipt for the
							crew (assuming release is simultaneous with the overwrite). Our plan is
							to repudiate the document as soon as the crew is released, arguing that
							all General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> did was
							acknowledge receipt of the crew.</p>
                        <p>It may be that at some future date the North Koreans would agree to
							release the crew on less onerous terms than those they now insist upon.
							But this is pure conjecture, and could be months or years away.</p>
                        <p>It is by no means certain that the North Koreans will accept our
							overwrite ploy, should we reach the point where we might use it. But
							neither do we have any evidence to indicate that they will not accept
							it. </p>
                        <p>There are several compelling reasons against trying to negotiate a
							document to replace that of May 8:</p>
                        <p>—It would involve many weeks of negotiation (assuming we could ever
							arrive at a mutually acceptable document, which I doubt). This might be
							an acceptable price, if it were not for other serious drawbacks.</p>
                        <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0735"/>
                        <p>—The North Koreans will continue for a very long time to insist on a
							document which (a) admits espionage and intrusion; (b) apologizes for
							both; (c) recognizes the <gloss target="#t_DPRK1">DPRK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>—If we are ever going to sign (or “acknowledge receipt on”) any document,
							the more patently false the better. The May 8 document is so bad that it
							will make our reasons for acceptance and repudiation that much more
								believable.<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">In a September 17 memorandum
								to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_WPC1">Warnke</persName> made a similar point, noting
								that “If we are to sign anything, I prefer that it be their document
								rather than one which we had revised. It would then be easier
								totally to repudiate the document.” (Washington National Records
								Center, RG 330, <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>/OASD/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> Files: FRC 73 A 1250, Korea
								092.2)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>—By entering into negotiations over the wording of the receipt we make
							the document “agreed”, thus increasing the difficulties of a clean-cut
							disavowal. (It is easier to disavow a document—outrageous blackmail on
							its face and “signed” for purely humanitarian reasons—than to disown one
							we have had a hand in drafting.) It would also make the overwrite ploy
							less credible to our own and world opinion.</p>
                        <p>—Anything less than the “clean-cut disavowal” mentioned above will raise
							questions about our consistent public denials of espionage and
							intrusion, and confirm the doubts of many—both in the US and abroad—who
							already tend to disbelieve them.</p>
                        <p>We still face a number of unpalatable decisions on our present course,
							but I am totally convinced that we should play the hand out before
							trying something else. If we now begin to argue about the wording of a
							document we have had before us for more than four months, it will be
							extremely difficult to justify waiting so long to raise an issue which
							can only add many additional weeks to our negotiations—and with no real
							likelihood of success.</p>

                        <p>242963. Subject: Instructions for 22nd Meeting.</p>
                        <p>1. Progress at last meeting makes it appear at least possible that
							overwrite ploy will work and next meeting should be used to press it
							hard. We note that Pak constantly reiterates idea that Woodward will
							“sign” but never himself contrasts or probes distinction between “sign”
							and <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s language. It may
							thus be that Pak will be satisfied with making a negotiating record to
							support contention Woodward is “signing” while allowing us to keep our
							own negotiating record clean of any assent to his assertion. Such
							agreement to disagree on record would satisfy us, particularly since
							audiences receptive to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> propaganda are
							not likely to pore over transcripts of talks, and careful reading by
							impartial observers will bear us out.</p>
                        <p>2. Pak will presumably open next meeting by restating assurance given at
							last meeting that crew will be returned “if your side signs document of
							May 8” and asking if <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							can now agree to sign. Or he may again state his “understanding” that
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> is ready to sign
							(as in para 25 of Seoul 9890)<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">Paragraph 25
								in telegram 9890 from Seoul, September 17, quotes Pak as stating: “I
								understand that this statement of yours implies that your side is
								ready to sign the document presented by our side on May 8 to have
								the crew sent back. If you agree to this understanding of mine,
								specific matters, including the matter concerned with your side's
								signing the document will be discussed later on.” <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> replied that he made no
								implications and simply wanted to understand Pak's position.
								(National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note>
							and ask <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s
							concurrence.</p>
                        <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0737"/>
                        <p>3. In either case <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							should respond as follows: “I have repeatedly asked you whether you
							agree to release the crew at the same time as I acknowledge that I am
							receiving them. You have repeatedly responded that I am reiterating a
							question which has already been made clear, because you are well aware
							that I insist on the simultaneous release of the entire crew and your
							side has already agreed to their release under certain conditions. You
							then have repeatedly asked me whether, when I spoke of a document whose
							language was satisfactory to you, I had in mind the document which you
							presented here on May 8. Since your side presented that draft, our side
							of course assumes that its language is satisfactory to you, even though
							its language does not reflect what we believe to be the true facts of
							this case and is in other respects inaccurate. The answer to your
							question is therefore yes, your draft of May 8 is obviously a document
							such as we had in mind. I am now prepared to state that if tomorrow you
							will release to me the entire crew, I will tomorrow acknowledge on your
							draft of May 8 that I am receiving them. I assume that this statement on
							my part will now make it possible for us to take the next step, that is,
							to discuss the specific arrangements for the release of the crew
							tomorrow. Is that correct?”</p>
                        <p>4. Pak will presumably respond by noting “that your side intends to sign
							our document of apology and assurance presented May 8” and will say that
							he cannot possibly make any arrangements for the next day, that he must
							consult with his authorities, etc. He will probably again seek
							ratification by <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> of his
							“understanding” of US position.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should handle such
							efforts along following lines: “You are misquoting me. You have said
							that under certain conditions your side would release the entire crew. I
							have said that under certain conditions I would be prepared to
							acknowledge receipt of the crew on your document of May 8. For example,
							if you will agree to release the entire crew tomorrow, then I can agree
							today that I will tomorrow acknowledge their receipt on your May 8
							document. I see no reason why the crew cannot be brought here tomorrow.
								(<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> may expand on
							this point as he judges appropriate.) You say that these specific
							arrangements cannot be carried through tomorrow. I ask, why not? And if
							it really is not possible, then when can the crew be brought here? How
							long will it take you to assemble and transport them? These are the
							specific arrangements which you said could be discussed if I would
							indicate my general acceptance of your demand that your document of May
							8 be used when I acknowledge that I am receiving the crew. Let us now
							move on to discuss these specific arrangements. I await your answer to
							my question on when the release can take place.”</p>
                        <p>6. As you see, our object in foregoing is to draw Pak into discussions on
							time and place of release, bypassing any discussion of what <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0738"/>Pak calls “detailed matters concerning
							signing of the document”. It might, for example, be easier for Pak to
							agree to simultaneity if he did not have to agree to it in principle but
							only had to talk of fixing dates. We do not expect any commitment on
							time at this meeting but <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should hammer at necessity for firm date as
							next move, while avoiding any unconditional statement of our willingness
							to use May 8 document, i.e., absent their agreement to imminent,
							simultaneous release.</p>
                        <p>7. As you can gather, it is most helpful to have on record repeated
							restatements of whatever commitments Pak has authority to make, not
							merely for sake of negotiating record, but in order to be sure they are
							solid commitments and not merely result of slip by Pak or his
							translators.</p>
                        <p>8. After squeezing from Pak as much blood as this turnip has in it,
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should attempt to
							close meeting on following lines: “You have said that despite statements
							I have made you still are not ready to discuss with me the time and
							place for the release of the crew. I propose that we recess until 11
							a.m. tomorrow so that you can obtain the authority to discuss that
							matter. Do you agree?”</p>
                        <p>9. We doubt that Pak will, in fact, agree to reconvene after 24 hours or
							any other specified pause, but <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should press on above lines to indicate that US
							side demands minimum and clearly specified delay from moment when it
							gives unconditional agreement to acknowledging receipt on May 8
							document. (See <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss> at end of para 11,
							State 237348.)<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">The referenced portion of
								paragraph 11 in telegram 237348 to Seoul, September 12, reads:
								“Though we cannot accept any delay between actual signed
								acknowledgment and release we probably could accept 48 hours between
								agreement to acknowledge receipt and release. If Pak suggests
								something like that <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should note it as firm offer which will be
								reported to Washington.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>10. If Pak should indicate either firm or approximate date when crew
							might be released, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							should propose meeting 24 hours in advance “to reach final agreement and
							make final arrangements on the conditions of the release”.</p>
                        <p>11. We would prefer that next meeting come quickly and in your discretion
							you may indicate to other side that we are ready.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Problem:</p>
                        <p>The fundamental issue at Panmunjom has been that the North Koreans have
							insisted on our signing an admission of espionage and <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0742"/>intrusion into their territorial
							waters, apologies for both, and a promise of no further intrusion.</p>
                        <p>We have refused to admit espionage or to apologize for acts we do not
							believe were committed. Various forms of conditional apology (e.g., we
							regret any intrusion that may have occurred) have been rejected.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The “Overwrite” Solution:</p>
                        <p>To break this impasse, we have, with your authorization on May 18, been
							exploring the possibility of General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> writing the following sentence on the “document
							of apology and assurance” presented on May 8 by the North Koreans:
							“There have been turned over to me today at Panmunjom 82 surviving
							members of the crew of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the
							body of Seaman Duane D. Hodges.” He would sign this inscription. If the
							North Koreans accepted this they would presumably claim that we had
							signed their piece of paper. We would say that we had signed only what
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> had written.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recent Progress:</p>
                        <p>For the last four months we have been pressing for a firm commitment by
							the North Koreans that if we were to “acknowledge receipt of the crew on
							a document satisfactory to them” they would simultaneously release the
							whole crew. At the 21st meeting (September 17) the North Koreans for the
							first time said unambiguously that if we would sign their document, they
							would return the crew. At the 22nd meeting (September 30), they were
							even more explicit, saying that the entire crew would be released
							simultaneous with our signing their document.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The “Overwrite” Not a Deception:</p>
                        <p>In the negotiations since May we have on a number of occasions noted that
							the North Korean document of May 8 does not correspond to what we
							believe are the facts. Moreover, we have been scrupulous in using the
							words “acknowledge receipt on” in describing what we might be prepared
							to do, and when Pak has interpreted this to mean that we were “willing
							to sign” General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> has
							replied, “You are using words I did not use.” Our Korean language
							experts tell us the difference between “sign” and “acknowledge receipt
							on” is even clearer in Korean than in English. Moreover, we have sent a
							message to the North Koreans through an Australian contact in Tokyo
							spelling out in more detail what we had in mind. We are not absolutely
							sure that this message got through to Pyongyang, but our Australian
							contact and his Korean friend are confident that it did.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, at the last (22nd) meeting, General Pak presented a slightly
							modified draft of his paper of May 8 with this additional paragraph at
							the bottom:</p>
                        <pb n="711" xml:id="pg_711" facs="0743"/>
                        <p>“Simultaneously with the signing of this document the under- signed
							acknowledges receipt of 82 former crew members of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and one corpse.” (The entire document is at Tab
								A.)<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">Tabs A, B, and C are attached but
								not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>This added paragraph tends to undercut our overwrite and confirms our
							feeling that Pak knows what we have in mind. If in the end he accepts
							the overwrite, we will not have misled or duped the North Koreans;
							rather they will have accepted an ambiguous act as meeting their
							requirements. They have been as consistent as we: they never speak of
							acknowledging receipt, only of “signing our document”. We are not at all
							sure that they will in fact accept the overwrite ploy.</p>
                        <p>The following courses of action appear open:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Track A: Attempt to negotiate a satisfactory
							receipt.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that the North Koreans would accept any draft which did
							not contain an admission of espionage and intrusion and an apology for
							both. Yet a negotiation which reduced but did not eliminate these
							unacceptable elements would have succeeded only in making the draft our
							own as well as theirs and therefore more difficult to repudiate. The
							more extreme the document the easier the repudiation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Track B: Sign, with an explanatory statement.</p>
                        <p>At the last Closed Meeting before the signing we could make a further
							statement for the record that it contains many assertions which we
							believe to be false, that we do not admit any crime, that the seizure
							was wholly illegal, and that we are signing the document only for
							humanitarian reasons to get back the crew. Our public statement at the
							time of signature and release would probably have to be limited to
							making clear that our signature was based entirely on the North Korean
							“evidence” as anything stronger might result in refusal to deliver the
							crew. Repudiation would follow, of course, immediately upon the crew's
							coming into our possession. (A draft of such a statement of repudiation
							is attached as Tab C.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Track C: Try a last-minute overwrite.</p>
                        <p>We would move ahead to negotiate with Pak the technical arrangements for
							the release, leaving unresolved the ambiguity between “sign” and
							“acknowledge receipt on”. We would then attempt the overwrite at the
							time of the actual delivery of the crew.</p>
                        <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0744"/>
                        <p>This might work, but if Pak rejected it we would be in a difficult
							position. He will probably insist on the press being present for the
							signature and release. For us to attempt to overwrite without a clear
							understanding and acceptance in advance might seem to the world to be
							sharp practice, and to stand firm on it would seem to many a heartless
							legalism. Rather than see the crew return to North Korea, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> would have to sign their
							form of receipt. And we could hardly argue that he had signed without
							instructions when faced by an unforeseen situation. If we proceed along
							this track we must be prepared to end up on Track B—signature, with a
							statement for the record that takes some of the bite out of the
							document.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Track D: Clarify the overwrite.</p>
                        <p>We would firm up the detailed arrangements for a release and tell Pak
							precisely what we plan to do in the overwrite.</p>
                        <p>Pak will probably reject this, at least for a meeting or two, perhaps
							finally. But he may accept it if convinced that this is as far as we are
							prepared to go. If he does agree, we have an impeccable record of
							disclosure and there is no legitimate basis for any accusations of sharp
							practice. If he finally does not agree, Track B is not foreclosed.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation.</p>
                        <p>I prefer alternative D. Track A is a dead end which will lose time
							without taking us anywhere. Track C is probably only a round-about way
							of getting to B—the outright signature. Though a public statement at the
							time of signing would help, the arguments against Track B are still
							strong. It would be demeaning to the United States to sign under
							blackmail imposed by an illegal act an apology for something we did not
							do and an admission that perfectly legal actions are illegal. We would
							not, for example, sign an admission that our actions in Viet-Nam
							constituted aggression and apologize for them even if this would insure
							release of 82 captured pilots. The repudiation of our signature would
							also be demeaning and could not wholly erase the stigma of the
							signature. The apology would confirm the belief of many in the United
							States and elsewhere that despite our denials and repudiation we were in
							fact engaged in improper acts, thus further tarnishing our reputation at
							home and abroad. Our men are dying and being captured in Viet-Nam and
							are risking their lives along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> in
							Korea. The <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew are no different. Finally,
							there is no need to consider alternative B unless it becomes quite clear
							that the overwrite (Track D) will not work.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that we proceed with alternative D. If it works it would
							result in the release of the crew on a basis with which we can live and
							if it should fail would not foreclose other alternatives, <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0745"/>should we later ever wish to use them.

                        <p>251495. Subject: Instructions for Twenty-third Meeting.</p>
                        <p>1. Although Pak's unambiguous acceptance of simultaneity and willingness
							release entire crew are heartening factors, para which he added to May 8
							document may make overwrite play more difficult to execute. (Other
							differences seem trivial.) As you noted, added para is clever
							combination of signature and receipt which turns our demand for
							simultaneity against us. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> clearly has worthy opponent.</p>
                        <p>2. Problem seems to us to lie in clarifying overwrite ploy sufficiently
							but not too much. We must make quite clear to Pak what we intend to do
							and satisfy ourselves that he accepts it. If at moment of signature
							overwrite were rejected it would be most embarrassing for us and if
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> for humanitarian
							reasons were compelled to sign on their dotted line, we could not
							plausibly argue that this had been unforeseen contingency for which
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> had not had
							instructions. Next meeting should therefore above all pin down Pak's
							acquiescence in overwrite—if he can give it.</p>
                        <p>3. On other hand we recognize Pak probably cannot go beyond direct
							agreement to specific procedures. His authorities will plan to <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0746"/>present overwrite as <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> ratification of body of document and we
							cannot expect explicit language from Pak which would undercut that plan.
							On our side, we should try to place on negotiating record language as
							helpful to our case as we can without killing deal. We recognize
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> will have to
							decide as he goes along how far beyond minimum he can risk going.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should also be aware
							that although our present intent is to press hard with overwrite and he
							should not say anything to encourage Pak to hope for more, we do not
							flatly exclude possibility of eventually meeting their demand if
							overwrite does not work.</p>
                        <p>5. You should call next meeting without delay and have <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> open along following
							lines:</p>
                        <p>“A. I am pleased to note that at our last meeting you agreed very clearly
							to the principle that the entire crew will be released at the same time
							that I acknowledge on your document that I am receiving them.</p>
                        <p>B. With this agreement on your part I believe that we can now proceed to
							discuss the practical details of the release.</p>
                        <p>C. I assume that you will want to transfer the crew to my custody here at
							Panmunjom. Is this correct?</p>
                        <p>D. The other important aspect of the release is the time. I indicated at
							our last meeting that I assumed 24 hours would be adequate time from the
							moment when we have settled all aspects of the problem to the moment of
							release. Am I correct? If you need more than 24 hours, how much more and
							why?”</p>
                        <p>6. Pak may respond directly to above queries, but more likely will
							preface by noting his “understanding” Woodward willing to sign document
							passed at last meeting and may give no more information in absence of
							confirmation. We will find useful whatever info on time and place
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> can extract
							without confirming Pak's “understanding”, but such info not essential at
							this stage and <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should
							give priority to avoiding confirmation that he will “sign” by
							reiterating “acknowledge receipt” each time Pak says “sign” and
							eventually using paras 9–11 below.</p>
                        <p>7. If info forthcoming, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							should then probe on other aspect of transfer. He should indicate he
							will wish first to verify that all 82 men present, then have them pass
							to UNC side while he is actually acknowledging receipt. He should say we
							want no press present. Pak will presumably insist on them and after
							arguing hardship for crew who have already suffered enough for carrying
							out orders, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should
							agree to report Pak's demand.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should give strong
							warning at appropriate moment, perhaps in above context, against any
							breach of privacy of talks. He should point out we have been scrupulous
							in observing secrecy and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> record not
							bad but note period immediately before release most delicate. Any breach
							at that time and in particular any assertion by <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0747"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> sources that US on verge of apology
							would be most harmful and could result in breakdown of arrangements.
								<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. This problem is of course very
							real and <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s tone and
							presentation should be designed impress Pak with seriousness of warning.
							If no appropriate occasion has arisen, this warning should be given at
							conclusion of meeting. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. After Pak has said all he will (perhaps nothing) on practical
							arrangements, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should
							turn to real problem: form of document to be used. After referring, if
							appropriate, to Pak's statement of what he expects, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should say as much of
							following as he feels he can:</p>
                        <p>“A. I want to make perfectly clear exactly what I am prepared to do to
							solve the problem we have been discussing in these meetings. I do not
							want there to be any doubt in your mind or mine about what the other
							intends to do.</p>
                        <p>B. On May 8 you presented a draft of what you would consider a suitable
							'document of apology and assurance.' I subsequently pointed out to you
							the problem raised by the divergences between your draft and the facts.
							We have told you and I repeat now that the mission of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was not 'espionage,' it was intelligence,
							that we can not accept the confessions and the 'evidence' you have shown
							us as 'proof' that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> intruded into the
							territorial waters claimed by you, and that we can not apologize for
							actions which we do not believe took place. You may confirm our
							statements on these points in the record of the Seventh, Fourteenth and
							Seventeenth Closed Meetings and elsewhere. We have also told you and I
							repeat now that we are prepared to assure you that our naval vessels
							will continue to be ordered to remain more than 12 nautical miles from
							your coast. You may confirm our statements on this point on the record
							of the Seventh Closed Meeting and subsequently.</p>
                        <p>C. Despite these statements you have continued to demand that I accept
							and sign your document and you have held the crew hostage to obtain my
							signature. I continue to object most strongly to this unprincipled
							blackmail.”</p>
                        <p>10. An alternate, and for Pak, less troublesome formulation of these
							points, would be:</p>
                        <p>“A. Unchanged from 9.A.</p>
                        <p>B. On May 8 you presented a draft of what you would consider a suitable
							'document of apology and assurance.' I subsequently pointed out to you
							the problems raised by the divergences between your draft and what we
							believe to be the facts. With regard to your assertions that the mission
							of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was espionage', that you had
							provided us with evidence' which proved that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> intruded into your territorial waters, and that we
							should apologize for these acts, our position has been clearly placed on
							the record of these meetings. That position has not altered. We have
							also told you and I repeat now that we are prepared to assure you that
							our naval vessels will continue to be ordered to remain more than 12
							nautical miles from your coast.</p>
                        <p>C. First sentence only from 9.C.”</p>
                        <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0748"/>
                        <p>11. Para 10 is minimum we believe should be gotten on record before
							proceeding to deliver following. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should of course feel free to select any
							variations bracketed by foregoing poles. He should then continue:
							“Nevertheless, in order to reach a solution of this problem, in order to
							reduce tensions in the area, and in order to permit these 82 innocent
							men to return to their families, I am prepared to use the draft you
							presented me at the September 30 meeting as a basis for solving the
							problem by acknowledging on it that I am receiving the custody of the
							crew. I will write on the draft the words:</p>
                        <p>I hereby acknowledge receipt of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew'
							and I will sign my name and title. Do you have any objection to these
							arrangements?”</p>
                        <p>12. If Pak objects that sentence to be written is superfluous in view of
							para added Sept 30 to May 8 document, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> may suggest para added be removed. <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: We actually see more advantage to
							retention of added para since redundancy of overwrite following added
							para buttresses argument that overwrite is all <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> is signing. We can, however,
							accept it either way so long as concept of overwrite in <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s hand is retained. End
								<gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">The
								Embassy noted that <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s instructions failed to mention where he
								should put his signature. Although the North Korean document
								included a signature block, the Embassy assumed and the Department
								of State confirmed that <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should sign under it. The Department of
								State also noted that “best of all would be to write diagonally
								across face of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> document.”
								(Telegrams 10316 from Seoul and 252348 to Seoul, both October 9;
								both ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>13. If Pak seems in genuine doubt about some aspects of above procedure,
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should try to
							clarify. If he insists in usual fashion on interpreting <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s statements as acceptance
							of signature of document, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should repeat “You are not using my language”
							and refer him to statement in para 11 above.</p>
                        <p>14. If Pak had earlier refused to be drawn into discussion of place and
							time of release and other details, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should make further attempt when foregoing
							discussion of overwrite has been concluded.</p>
                        <p>15. When and if it becomes clear that Pak fully understands and accepts
							proposal in para 11, and assuming other details seem generally in hand,
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should ask Pak to
							fix date on which crew will be released. If Pak does so, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should propose meeting 24
							hours before to confirm all arrangements. If Pak does not fix date,
							Woodward should suggest Pak call next meeting when he has firm date to
							propose.</p>

                        <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> opened
							meeting by suggesting that discussion of practical details of release of
							crew be held. He asked if his assumption was correct that 24 hours would
							be adequate time from the moment all aspects of the problem had been
							settled to the moment of release.</p>
                        <p>3. General Pak did not reply to 24-hour question but handed Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> detailed paper giving <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> proposal for release of crew (text
							included in transcript of meeting which follows) and roster of crew with
							proposed order of release (being pouched). Paper made clear <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> desire for maximum publicity at time of
							release and <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> intention to publicize
							agreement to sign as soon as agreement reached. Paper made no mention of
							time interval between agreement to sign and actual release but did
							specify two-hour interval between actual signing and time of
							release.</p>
                        <p>4. Department will note from transcript of meeting that arrangements for
							release proposed by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side differ
							considerably from Breeches Buoy concept<note n="4" xml:id="d319fn4">
								Breeches Buoy was the name given to the operational plan for the
								recovery, return, and intelligence debriefing of the crew
								members.</note> and are designed to provide maximum <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> advantage (e.g. by use of bridge of no
							return rather than <gloss target="#t_JSA1">JSA</gloss> as release
							point). <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> sketch of area of release
							being pouched.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> pushed hard
							for exclusion of press at time of signing. Pak took line that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> wanted to have three photographers
							present at signing and had no objection if US made similar arrangement.
								<pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0750"/>As noted above, <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s obviously arranging for big propaganda
							show at time of actual release of crew.</p>
                        <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> then took up
							need to maintain secrecy at this stage of negotiations. General Pak did
							not reply to this point, presumably because <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> proposals for arrangements concerning release openly
							state <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> intention to publicize US
							agreement to sign as soon as agreement given.</p>
                        <p>7. Final matter raised by Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> was statement for record contained in para 9
								<gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss> and explanation our
							concept of acknowledgement of receipt contained para 11 <gloss target="#t_Reftel1">reftel</gloss>. There was 33 minute pause while
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> considered response. Pak
							eventually replied that General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s statement meant that US was not willing to
							see early solution of the question of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							crew and it could not be understood otherwise. US side would never get
							crew back unless it made the apology and guarantee suggested by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side.</p>
                        <p>8. General Pak's reply to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s statement on acknowledgement of receipt did
							not directly reject this concept. Pak stated inter alia “Your side
							agreed to the matter of principle for the solution of the question of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew but has now taken an insincere
							and arrogant attitude for frustrating the agreement. Whom are you
							fooling?” General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							considers it possible that our definition of acknowledgement of receipt
							came as a surprise to Pak and he had no instructions to cover this
							matter.</p>
                        <p>9. If <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side genuinely believes we were
							on point of agreeing to sign and considers overwrite ploy a “trick,” it
							is possible they will now seek to increase pressure on US through
							stepped-up propaganda campaign. One obvious avenue of approach would be
							to reiterate threat to try crew. Other would be to announce that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> had made specific offer to release crew
							and US had not seen fit to accept it.</p>
                        <p>10. Summarizing recent meetings we now know:</p>
                        <p>1. Details of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> proposals concerning
							actual arrangements for release.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> agreement to “simultaneous release”
							which actually would be two hours after signing.</p>
                        <p>3. Time between agreement to sign and actual release of crew would be
							long enough for <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> to publicize US
							agreement.</p>
                        <p>4. Question of overwrite still pending.</p>
                        <p>11. Prior to recess General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> agreed to consider detailed arrangements
							presented by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side and to comment at
							next meeting.</p>

                        <p>254615. Subject: Instructions for Twenty-fourth Meeting—Part 1.</p>
                        <p>1. We are of course somewhat disheartened by Pak's apparent surprise when
							acknowledgement of receipt defined in precise terms. We had been
							reasonably confident that Pak had at least suspected our intentions,
							since para added to their document at 22nd meeting was clearly designed
							to undercut it. Pak's strong reaction may thus be explained partly in
							terms of hope, now dashed, that we would allow ambiguity to persist
							until moment of transfer. Whether he planned to confront <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> with last minute demand for
							naked signature or planned to present overwrite to his superiors as
							trivial detail or had genuinely not foreseen overwrite we will probably
							never know. Wisdom of clarifying our intent seems, however, quite
							evident since last minute breakdown would be most painful.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether Pak's surprise was genuine or feigned and how serious his
							objections will prove to be will only come out in next meeting or two.
							It is clear <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s thought they were close
							to resolution of matter and were more than willing to liquidate it on
							their terms. We will have to wait and see whether this has generated
							momentum favorable to overwrite compromise. Meanwhile we will activate
							whatever additional pressures might move them to a favorable decision,
							e.g., threatening noises toward ships being built in Netherlands.<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">Four fish-factory ships for North Korea were
								being built in the Netherlands for completion between October 1968
								and July 1969. Some consideration had been given to ways they might
								be used to pressure the North Koreans. (Memoranda from <persName corresp="#p_JALS1">Jenkins</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> and from <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> to the President, September

								History, Pueblo Crisis 1968, Vol. 8, Day-by-Day Documents, Part

                        </p>
                        <p>3. Our general line for next meeting or two should therefore be
							stonewalling on main point combined with indications of flexibility on
							side issues.</p>
                        <p>4. If Pak has made no move to call meeting by October 18, General
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should indicate
							through <gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss> that he is ready any
							time.</p>
                        <p>5. Pak will presumably open with expanded version of closing statement
							last meeting and with renewed demand that <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> state willingness “sign the document of apology
							and assurance.” He will <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0752"/>probably elaborate on charge <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> is going back on “agreement in principle.”</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should reply on
							following lines:</p>
                        <p>“A. At the last meeting I made a clear, specific proposal for settling
							this matter. You have responded with a general attack on my position. I
							deny that I have in any way gone back on an agreement in principle.'</p>
                        <p>B. I refer again to my specific proposal at the last meeting that we
							solve this problem by using your draft document presented on September
							30. I will write on that document the words 'I hereby acknowledge
							receipt of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew' and I will sign my
							name and title. Do you have any specific objection to these
							arrangements?”</p>
                        <p>7. If Pak's opening statement contains no general attack but simply
							avoids either concurring with or objecting to overwrite, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should use only point B
							above.</p>
                        <p>8. Pak may respond to para 6 above with flat negative or specific attack
							on overwrite phrase, or may again deliver general attack. In any case,
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should reply
							making following points:</p>
                        <p>A. He should note Pak's statement.</p>
                        <p>B. He should regret, if appropriate, Pak's belligerent tone after
							businesslike atmosphere which had characterized recent meetings.</p>
                        <p>C. He should then say May 8 document most repugnant to us. We would much
							prefer to have nothing to do with it. Nevertheless, to secure release of
							captives, we have consistently indicated since Seventeenth Meeting that
							we might find it possible to move to a solution based on that
							document.</p>
                        <p>D. We have consistently proposed since May using their draft and
							acknowledging on it that crew was simultaneously being released. We have
							consistently said, “I will acknowledge receipt on a document

							deviated. In fact, at conclusion of last meeting in attacking our
							position he accurately quoted it. (<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> may wish to read back first two sentences of
							para 15 Seoul 10340.)<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">That portion of
								telegram 10340 from Seoul, October 10, quotes Pak as having said:
								“At the last meeting your side suggested to discuss the specific
								procedural matters, asking us 'If I agree to acknowledge receipt of
								the crew on the particular document which you have just presented
								can you release them to me against my signature?' and at today's
								meeting too you have confirmed it and suggested to discuss the
								specific procedural matters, the next subject. Thus, at today's
								meeting the specific procedural matters are being discussed on the
								basis of such an agreement.” (National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US)</note> Concept of
							simultaneous release was eventually accepted by Pak. Our offer to
							acknowledge it on <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> document was
							repeatedly misinterpreted by Pak but these misinterpretations have been
							regularly and carefully corrected. We are surprised Pak should now
							reopen problem which we had believed was closed. Pak must study record
							carefully. He will see there is no inconsistency in our position.</p>
                        <p>E. <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side may not be completely satisfied
							with procedure we have proposed. Nevertheless they have interest in
							accepting this proposal <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0753"/>and
							resolving issue. Dragging matter out is obviously undesirable for us
							since crew being made to suffer as hostages. But prolongation also not
							desirable from <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> point of view. Their
							relations with other countries—both political and economic—cannot fail
							to suffer from their contemptuous disregard of international law and
							morality. It will be to their benefit to begin to conform to these
							international standards and it will only harm them more and more
							seriously if they do not.</p>
                        <p>F. Pak should bring these considerations to attention of his
							authorities.</p>
                        <p>9. If Pak persists in flat rejection of overwrite proposal, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should express surprise and
							regret, say he had thought we had found a solution, urge Pak to
							reconsider, and suggest adjournment.</p>
                        <p>10. If at opening or in response to any of foregoing statements Pak
							indicates acceptance of our proposal, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should say he is prepared to comment on Pak's
							suggestions for handling press and other procedural matters. He should

							General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> believes
								<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> intentions were to probe US
							thinking on overwrite proposal rather than reject it outright while
							giving impression that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side was
							unyielding on obtaining complete US acceptance of its proposal. Tone of
							meeting was not as harsh as transcript might indicate and only in last
							formal statement did Pak speak with vigor.</p>
                        <p>2. Pak opened with a review of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> version
							of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> incident and negotiations. He stated
							that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side had submitted a document
							with correct title and name and that crew could be returned if we signed
							document. He accused US of making absurd assertions that we wanted to
							add unnecessary things to document and to “sign it on your behalf
							instead of signing it as it is.” Called this “petty stratagem.”</p>
                        <p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> repeated the
							exact words he intended to write on the <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> document and asked if <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							side had specific objections.</p>
                        <p>4. Pak said proposal ridiculed meeting and that document they proposed
							included even terms of receipt we wanted, again asked if US prepared to
							sign.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> pointed out
							consistency of US position noting he had never used any other words than
							“I will acknowledge on a document satisfactory to you” and that he had
							corrected Pak when he had misquoted him. He then made points in paras C
							and D of State 254615.<note n="3" xml:id="d321fn3">
                                <ref target="#d320">Document 320</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. There was a pause of over 30 minutes while Pak apparently sent for
							instructions on how to proceed. He then said US had agreed in principle
							to sign document and on this basis discussion at last meeting had gone
							to procedures for release of crew. In middle of this US had upset
							discussions by proposing “some sort of compromise”.</p>
                        <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0755"/>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> denied going back on
							any agreement in principle and said he was surprised at rejection of US
							proposal and urged its reconsideration. He said if Pak had nothing more
							to say he proposed the meeting adjourn.</p>
                        <p>8. Pak again asked whether US was ready to sign the document and General
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> repeated his
							willingness to acknowledge receipt on a document at time <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew simultaneously released.</p>
                        <p>9. Pak then held out a copy of the document and said that <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s name and title were
							clearly written on it together with the terms of acknowledging of the
							crew. He then asked “does this mean you will sign here under your name?”
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> said he would
							write the receipt on the face of the document and sign his name and
							title. When asked where, he indicated diagonally across face of
							document. Reaction from <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side was
							visibly negative. He then suggested writing and signing on clear space
							at bottom of document. Again reaction was visibly negative. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> then indicated there were
							other ways the document might be signed. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> believes negative reactions
							of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side was deliberate and was
							intended to draw as much specific information on signing as possible
							from US side.</p>
                        <p>10. Pak then in prepared statement said US could not get crew back
							without signing document as it was. He said <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> patience had its limits and he had said all there was to
							say. He said he was not interested in continuing empty talks, called the
							US proposal “shameless games” and said US side should come back when it
							was prepared to sign. He then accepted <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s proposal to adjourn.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> believes that we
							must wait at least until the next meeting to determine whether Pyongyang
							is prepared to make any concessions on overwrite proposal.</p>

                        <p>261040. Subject: Instructions for Twenty-fifth Meeting.</p>
                        <p>1. Best way to convey to North Koreans that we are not considering
							straightforward signature of their document would seem to be to call
							next meeting quickly and simply ask if they are now ready accept our
							proposal. If Pak objects to early meeting we should not press since they
							may really be debating overwrite now that its details perfectly clear,
							and if brought to meeting before debate concluded would temporize with
							attacks which might dig them in deeper. Best solution might be note
							through <gloss target="#t_JDO1">JDO</gloss> on lines, “I am ready, if
							you are,” rather than proposing particular date.</p>
                        <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s opening
							statement should be quite direct and brief. Following points should be
							made:</p>
                        <p>A. Since May we have consistently proposed solution which should be
							acceptable to <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>. It is based on their
							document and on our principle of simultaneous release.</p>
                        <p>B. Pak's allegations we have “upset agreements in principle” are not
							true. As pointed out last meeting, we have stated our position very
							carefully, checking both English and Korean versions, and have corrected
							Pak's misstatements of it.</p>
                        <p>C. If Pak somehow failed to understand, his confusion certainly cleared
							up by very detailed explanations at October 10 and October 23
							meetings.</p>
                        <p>D. We now await his response. Does he have specific objections to
							specific procedures outlined by us?</p>
                        <p>3. If Pak again denounces our position in general terms but avoids
							closing door on any overwrite, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should note that he has already repeatedly
							responded to these general comments and propose adjournment, adding
							suggestion that Pak call next meeting when he is ready to take up our
							concrete proposal for solving this problem.</p>
                        <p>4. If Pak opens up business of where <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s signature would be located, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should ask if this is only
							major problem obstructing solution of matter, indicating that such a
							problem can certainly be solved. Should Pak respond it definitely is
							critical problem and that signature must be on line provided, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> may say that he can agree to
							add sentence acknowledging receipt in his own handwriting <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0757"/>above that line, then place his
							signature on it, provided it seems likely that his assent to this
							procedure will lead to the simultaneous release of the crew.</p>
                        <p>5. If Pak responds that no overwrite acceptable and <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> must sign on dotted line,
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should say he will
							report his regrettable position to his authorities, and he hopes Pak's
							authorities will have further thoughts. He should note it will be Pak's
							turn to call next meeting and propose adjournment.</p>
                        <p>6. If Pak should accept overwrite, State 255214<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">See <ref target="#d320fn4">footnote 4, Document
									320</ref>.</note> continues to provide appropriate guidance.</p>

                        <p>The meetings in September made it clear to us that the North Koreans are
							willing to give us back the crew at the moment (or almost <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0759"/>the moment) we sign their document.
							There would still be some procedural problems but they seem
							manageable.</p>
                        <p>The meetings in October made clear to the North Koreans what they may not
							have understood: that we are not prepared to <hi rend="italic">sign</hi>
							their document but only to <hi rend="italic">acknowledge receipt on
								it</hi>. We have not explained to them in so many words that we
							intend, after the release, to denounce the document, hanging our
							repudiation on this distinction between “signing” and “acknowledging
							receipt on,” and saying that we had <hi rend="italic">signed</hi> only
							what Woodward had himself written. But there is no doubt that they now
							understand this intent. They have denounced our proposal as a “petty
							stratagem” designed to “evade your responsibilities,” and at present
							they appear determined not to leave this loophole open.</p>
                        <p>We called the last meeting (October 31) very quickly on the heels of the
							preceding one in order to appear firm in our stand. They hesitated for
							three days before agreeing to meet, but their position at the meeting
							was unyielding and they may merely have been taken a bit off balance by
							the unusual speed of our move. It is now their turn to call and they
							have made no move since October 31 to convene a session.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Our Choices</p>
                        <p>We can (1) stand on the overwrite proposal, perhaps with minor
							variations; or (2) sign their document, prefacing our signature with an
							explanatory statement and repudiating the document as soon as the crew
							are free.<note n="2" xml:id="d324fn2">In a memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, drafted on December 9,
									<persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> detailed these
								and a third option—reformulating a “conditional apology” that met
								North Korean demands but contained no untrue statements, thus basing
								an apology on the crew's confessions and similar statements—in a
								draft instructional telegram to Seoul for the next Senior Members
								meeting. (Ibid.) The options were discussed at a lunch meeting with
								the President on Tuesday, December 10. The first two options were

                        <p>The fact that Christmas is approaching and that the Administration will
							soon change offers us an opportunity to give the North Koreans an
							ultimatum without grave risk of breaking off the talks. We can call a
							meeting, give them a package of proposals, and say: “Take your choice;
							these offers are good only if you accept one of them in time to get the
							men home for Christmas. This Administration will then withdraw them and
							will make no further proposals.” If this ploy failed, the new
							Administration would be free to resume the negotiations on whatever
							lines it chose.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Variations on Standing Pat</p>
                        <p>We can simply offer to the North Koreans our present overwrite proposal,
							giving them the Christmas deadline to take it or leave it.</p>
                        <p>We can also revive the alternative of a conditional apology (“if we
							intruded, we are sorry”) which we made last Spring and which was bluntly
							rejected then. We would dress it up in new language so that it might on
							the surface seem a new element but we would not include the unacceptable
							North Korean demands: the flat admission of “espionage” and of repeated
							intrusions. If the North Koreans are minded to settle the issue, this
							might satisfy their need for a piece of paper with General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s name at the bottom.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Repudiated Apology</p>
                        <p>It is reasonably clear that if we simply sign their document we will
							promptly get the men back. The pros and cons of this course make an
							intricate argument which is summarized at Tab A. We do not recommend an
							outright apology, since it would be costly in foreign policy terms, but
							we recognize that the argument for an apology appeals to many reasonable
							men.</p>
                        <p>We could mitigate some, though not all, of the evil in an outright
							apology by coupling our signature with a simultaneous or perhaps even
							prior repudiation of the content of the North Korean document. We could,
							for example, have General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> say into the cameras and tape recorders just
							before he signs that, as has been made clear in the negotiations, the
							United States Government does not believe the Pueblo committed espionage
							or intruded, and that he is signing for the purely humanitarian reasons
							of getting the crew back. We are far from certain that the North Koreans
							would accept this procedure if warned about it in advance, and if not
							warned, they might at the last minute refuse to transfer the crew. And
							even such a “repudiated apology” would have demeaning elements from our
							viewpoint. Nevertheless, some variation on this ploy deserves serious
							consideration for inclusion in our take-it-or-leave-it package.</p>
                        <p>We would tell the North Koreans that we are now prepared to sign their
							document but will have to make a statement, before we actually sign,
							that their document contains statements which we consider false, and
							that our signature does not alter these facts. Release of the crew and
							publication of the signed North Korean document would follow. Our
							repudiation would be released to the press simultaneously with their
							document. We would have settled the problem through mutual acceptance of
							two wholly inconsistent statements.</p>
                        <p>We doubt that the North Koreans would accept this alternative, but they
							might. If they did, we would have paid a substantial but not exorbitant
							price to close out the problem.</p>
                        <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0761"/>
                        <p>The most dangerous aspect of such a proposal is that it places on the
							negotiating record an offer by us to sign their document. The North
							Koreans are certain to regard this as an indication that we are
							gradually knuckling under and they will simply press us to remove our
							attached condition—the repudiation. The “squeeze play” described above
							does much to meet this danger, but perhaps not enough. The North Koreans
							may well feel that if they disregard our ultimatum we will come back
							after Christmas or after January 20 with an unconditional offer to
							apologize.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this additional offer of a “repudiated apology” has a
							better chance of success than the others, but the costs to us in foreign
							policy terms would still be serious. We therefore are inclined to adopt
							the following more limited package, despite its relatively small chance
							of success, i.e., to say to the North Koreans that we are prepared to
							accept either of the following alternatives provided that it will result
							in the release of the crew before Christmas. If neither of these offers
							is accepted, they will both be withdrawn after Christmas and the North
							Koreans will then have to deal with the new Administration. The
							proposals would be:</p>
                        <p>a. Our present overwrite proposal.</p>
                        <p>b. A conditional apology similar to that offered last May, but in new
							language.</p>
                        <p>You may wish to discuss this problem with Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d324fn3">Printed from a

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Nature of the Case</p>
                        <p>The arguments in favor of signing the North Korean document come down to
							two propositions:</p>
                        <p>a. It is the only humane thing to do since it is clear that unless we
							sign the North Koreans will not release the crew—certainly not for a
							long time.</p>
                        <p>b. It is disadvantageous politically for us to let the affair drag
							on.</p>
                        <p>The argument against signing comes down to the single proposition that
							this Government should not solemnly place its authorized signature on a
							document it knows to be false, particularly if acting under blackmail
							and duress.</p>
                        <p>Apart from these, there are many secondary arguments—about the
							credibility gap, about the effects in South Korea and on our commitments
								<pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0762"/>in general, etc. In our
							judgment, these arguments tend to balance each other off or to fall in
							the category “an apology wouldn't really be so bad because …” They thus
							should not be decisive in determining whether we apologize or not.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Argument for Apologizing</p>
                        <p>Only when we sign their document will we get the crew back. If only
							because the North Korean charges are lies, they will insist on a piece
							of paper from us validating their lies. They have been and will remain
							wholly inflexible on this point. We have no means of pressure which look
							promising. All reasonable people know the North Korean charges are false
							and that we would be signing purely from humanitarian considerations. We
							would not be seriously damaged by a signature and we owe it to the crew
							and their families to pay this price for their release.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there are political problems in allowing the matter to
							stagnate. It reminds people of our impotence and generates pressure for
							unwise actions, such as seizing North Korean ships. Better to cut the
							knot, even at some cost.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Assessing the case</hi>. It is probably true that the
							North Koreans will not soon accept any compromise, such as our overwrite
							proposal. And we do not seem to have any effective pressures against
							them. The humanitarian argument is the most valid argument for
							signature.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe the political argument is valid. If we resolve neither
							to apologize nor to do anything that might risk war or violate our basic
							principles, the political pressures can be contained.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Argument Against Apologizing</p>
                        <p>The evil effects of signing a false document under pressure would be
							widespread, insidious, and long-lasting. Most foreign governments and
							even many Americans are puzzled by our reluctance to utter untruths but
							they respect us for this eccentricity. The Communist doctrine that truth
							is relative and can legitimately be manipulated is a major difference
							between them and us. If we sign we will have seriously damaged our good
							name.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Assessing the case</hi>. Many reasonable people find
							this argument vague and idealistic. We find it profoundly true. If we
							were to apologize, the price paid for freeing the men would be
							substantial, though hard to define. It would not be costly in the short
							run since the general relief and gratification that they were free would
							combine with their own revelations to override the negative elements.
							Nor would it impair faith in our security commitments which are on quite
							another level of solemnity and gravity. But over the long run the fact
							that in this case we had bent our principles for tactical, even though
							humanitarian, considerations would have to be counted, a serious cost.
							Whether we <pb n="731" xml:id="pg_731" facs="0763"/>owe it to the men to
							pay this price, or should look on them as on other prisoners of war, is
							a question to which individual consciences and political philosophies
							will give varying answers. The price in international political terms
							would be considerable.</p>

                        <p>1. Approach of Christmas, combined with change of Administration here
							shortly thereafter, offers us opportunity to press North Koreans for
							release of <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew without serious risk of
							formal break in negotiations if they reject our offer. We plan to
							present them two proposals with warning that unless one is accepted
							promptly so that men can be home by Christmas, these proposals will be
							withdrawn and this Administration will make no further offers.
							Republican Administration would then have free hand for any subsequent
							dealings.</p>
                        <p>2. Our hope is that North Koreans will calculate that they are not likely
							to get more from President-elect Nixon than from President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and will accept one of choices
							offered. We hope also that recent visit of CVA <hi rend="italic">
								Hancock </hi> will have reminded them that winding-down of Viet-Nam
							war could liberate resources to improve US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military posture and that they would be well advised to
							reduce sources of tension, both by releasing <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew and by desisting from infiltration attempts such
							as Ulchin.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">For Seoul</hi>. Charge should convey to Prime
							Minister our intentions as outlined above, describing in general terms
							contents of package to be offered North Koreans.<note n="2" xml:id="d325fn2">The Prime Minister was briefed on December 13. He

                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">For Moscow</hi>. We are calling in Soviet Charge to
							convey fact that final offer from this Administration is about to be
							delivered at Panmunjom.<note n="3" xml:id="d325fn3">The Soviet Charge
								was informed orally by <persName corresp="#p_TM1">Toon</persName> on
								December 14 and was given a text of his remarks, which outlined the
								two options to be presented to the North Koreans at the next closed
								meeting. (Telegram 287260 to Moscow, December 14; ibid.)</note> You
							may as you judge appropriate raise matter in any contacts with Soviet
							leaders. If you can stimulate reflections among Soviets along lines of
							para 2 above, so much the better. At minimum, any reference by them to
							carrier <hi rend="italic"> Hancock </hi> should be countered with strong
							denunciation of Ulchin landings. If Soviets were to conclude (wrongly)
							that <hi rend="italic"> Hancock </hi> operations somehow related to
							Ulchin landings, we would not mind. If such landings are continued and
							expanded as we fear is Pyongyang's intent, we may face situation as
							serious as that created by Blue House and <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							incidents.</p>
                        <p>5. Negotiating instructions for Seoul are contained in following
							paras.</p>
                        <p>6. Although protocol calls for Pak to speak first, we assume he will make
							only brief pro forma statement and turn floor over to General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>. If he delivers long
							denunciation of past US positions, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should probably brush it aside with brief
							comment and go directly into presentation of our proposals. Of course,
							if Pak opens with something new or shows interest in overwrite,
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> will have to
							decide on spot whether to explore possible opening or proceed with
							offers below. Following guidance is based on assumption Pak says nothing
							really new.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should draw
							attention to fact that Christmas, a national holiday of great
							significance to Americans, is only X days off and that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> very much wants to have <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crewmen reunited with their families by
							that date.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should then point
							out that present Administration will end on January 20 and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will from that point have a new
							President, Mr. Nixon, and new Secretaries of State and Defense. If <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> matter not settled by then, the new
							Administration will have to decide what measures it considers
							appropriate to deal with the problem.</p>
                        <p>9. This Administration intends, however, to make one last effort to solve
							the matter. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should say
							that he is authorized to state that President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> personally and the other
							leaders of this Administration are prepared to go very far indeed in
							order to realize the humanitarian objective of reuniting the crew with
							their families at Christmas. They are prepared to offer General Pak and
							his authorities their choice of either of the following ways of handling
							the matter.</p>
                        <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0765"/>
                        <p>A. We are willing to make their draft Document of Apology and Assurance
							the basis for a solution, and General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> is authorized to agree to sign his name on that
							document, provided that he writes in above his name the phrase “I hereby
							acknowledge receipt of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew”.</p>
                        <p>B. If General Pak's authorities prefer to avoid the use of this
							additional phrase, General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> is authorized simply to sign his name on the
							place provided, but under one specific condition. This condition relates
							to the fact that, as Pak is aware from the long discussions which have
							taken place in these negotiations, (1) the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> does not consider that the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> was engaged in illegal activities, (2) the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has not seen convincing evidence that
							the ship intruded into the waters claimed by Pak's authorities, and (3)
							the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot apologize for an action
							unless that action actually took place. If General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> were to sign Pak's document
							without first adding the overwrite phrase above, he would have to make a
							formal statement just before signing to clarify those three points. The
							only reason the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has considered
							instructing <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> to sign is
							for humanitarian reasons in order to obtain the freedom of these
							hostages who are being held against this sort of ransom. Only if this
							fact is made absolutely clear in conjunction with signature, can
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> be authorized to
							sign Pak's document. <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							should also make clear to Pak that, if Pak's authorities announce prior
							to signature that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is admitting
							its crimes and apologizing, or otherwise divulge publicly the contents
							of the document to be signed, we would at that point be required to
							release our statement explaining what we consider to be the meaning of
							the signature.</p>
                        <p>10. After presenting above choices, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> should suggest Pak study them and offer to
							respond to any questions he may have. He should remind Pak that
							Christmas deadline, though it may seem sentimental to others, has great
							meaning for Americans which thus gives it political significance. These
							offers will all be withdrawn December 23 and a rapid decision by Pak's
							authorities is essential.</p>
                        <p>11. Faced with our deadline, Pak will probably avoid closing any doors
							with further denunciation of A. He may, however, be puzzled by B and may
							wish to explore how it differs from repudiation after signature and
							release, which he presumably has always expected from us. If he comes
							back with questions, <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							should state that formal statement referred to in our proposal B would
							be a clarification by us of the nature of that document and the reason
							we were signing it. Our clarification would contain the three points
							noted in para 9.B. above and would explain that we were signing a
							document which was in contradiction with those points in order to obtain
							the release of the crew. A text of such a clarification is contained in
							the following para and <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							may offer it to Pak if he wishes.</p>
                        <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0766"/>
                        <p>12. Statement by General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>. “The position of the United States Government
							with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, as consistently
							expressed in the negotiations at Panmunjom and in public, has been that
							the ship was not engaged in illegal activity, that there is no
							convincing evidence that the ship at any time intruded into the
							territorial waters claimed by North Korea, and that we could not
							apologize for actions which we did not believe took place. The document
							which I am going to sign was prepared by the North Koreans and is at
							variance with the above position, but my signature will not and cannot
							alter the facts. I will sign the document to free the crew and only to
							free the crew.”</p>
                        <p>13. For General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s
							information, we contemplate his reading statement in para 12 into tape
							recorders just before he signs. Text would be available for distribution
							to press along with <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> document.<note n="4" xml:id="d325fn4">In reply to procedural questions raised by
								the Embassy, the Department of State addressed the two most
								important issues in case an overwrite agreement was reached: (1) the
								type of announcement to be made once an agreement was made and the
								length of time between acceptance on and (2) the signing and release
								of the crew. Regarding the first, the Department preferred that each
								side announce the agreement and the time of the release, but would
								repudiate any North Korean attempts to claim the U.S. would
								“acknowledge and apologize for crimes.” Concerning the second, the
								Department preferred no more than a 24-hour delay, but was willing
								to accept a maximum of 48 hours, if necessary. Most other details
								had been previously discussed or left to <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s discretion. (Telegram

                        <p>2. Gen Pak opened meeting by stating there was no alternative to signing

							Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> then made

                                <ref target="#d325">Document 325</ref>.</note> saying that if
							proposal (B) preferred we would have to make statement on signing, Gen
							Pak then proposed recess which lasted fifty minutes.</p>
                        <p>3. Following recess, Pak indicated <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							acceptance proposal (B). Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> agreed to sign to right of signature block in
							accordance with Korean custom.</p>
                        <p>4. General Pak then said that agreement in principle had been reached on
							signing and questions of procedure could be considered. Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> read statement he would make
							on signing in accordance with proposal (B). Pak made no comment.</p>
                        <p>5. Gen Pak asked if we accepted the proposal on procedures which he had
							made previously. Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							in reply gave Pak our counter proposals (State 255214, State
								268226).<note n="5" xml:id="d326fn5">See <ref target="#d320fn4">footnote 4, Document 320</ref>.</note> Pak did not comment. He
							seemed untroubled by our counter proposals with the exception our desire
							avoid two-hour time gap between actual signing and release of crew.</p>
                        <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> outlined
							administrative questions on which agreement would be needed such as
							handling of coffin and removal of <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> road
							barrier in <gloss target="#t_JSA1">JSA</gloss>. Gen Pak said he would

                        <p>7. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> strongly

                        <p>At the 26th meeting last night (Washington time), the North Koreans
							accepted “in principle” our latest proposal, a “pre-repudiated apology”.
							General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> passed to
							General Pak the text of the statement (Tab A) which <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> will read into the record
							just before signing the North Korean document (Tab B).<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">Tabs A and B attached but not printed. The text of
								Tab A is the same as paragraph 12, <ref target="#d325">Document
									325</ref>. Tab B is the same as paragraph 3, <ref target="#d306">Document 306</ref>.</note> General Pak, who had just accepted
							the concept of such a repudiatory statement, did not raise any
							objections to this text. Prime Minister <persName>Chung</persName> had
							been briefed on our proposal and raised no objection.</p>
                        <p>Procedural details remain to be settled. There will have to be at least
							one more meeting (probably Wednesday evening) and perhaps several. The
							possibility of some hang-up remains. The North Koreans may press us to
							modify our statement, for example. But it looks as though the men will
							be free before Christmas.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Next Steps</p>
                        <p>The scenario is fairly well fixed up to the point when the crew is
							released. Our important problems will be to explain what has happened to
							the American public and the world.</p>
                        <p>At the time of release we will publish both the North Korean document and
							our statement repudiating its contents. We will be prepared to elaborate
							to the press why we agreed to resolve the matter through these two
							obviously incompatible documents and what the North Korean acceptance of
							our statement implies about the truth of their allegations. A brief
							statement should probably be issued at this point on behalf of the
							President welcoming the release but not going into the details of the
							arrangement.</p>
                        <p>As quickly as possible, we will seek confirmation from Captain Bucher and
							the crew that there was no intrusion and that their confessions were
							extorted. If possible, Captain Bucher will immediately make <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0769"/>a brief statement to this effect to the
							press in Korea. We will then brief the press here in detail on the
							numerous inconsistencies in the North Korean “evidence”, explaining how
							we have been so confident they were forgeries. (If Captain Bucher says
							the ship <hi rend="italic">did</hi> intrude, we will have to consider
							what public statement to make, taking into account evidence from other
							officers, etc.)</p>
                        <p>We will then have to decide, in the light of information received from
							the crew, what portion of the draft White Paper should be made available
							to the press. We may wish to publish excerpts from the actual
							negotiating record, or we may prefer to give priority to comments by
							crew members on their experience.</p>
                        <p>As soon as medical checks have been made the crew will be flown to San
							Diego for reunion with their families and for detailed debriefings.</p>

                        <p>288724. Subject: Instructions for Twenty-seventh Meeting.</p>
                        <p>1. We believe current instructions cover most problems likely to arise at
							next meeting and there is little we can do until Pak delivers his
							responses to presentation made at Twenty-sixth meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. One worrisome question is how to respond if Pak tries to whittle away
							formal statement <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> is to
							make. Particularly in view of time element, we prefer to react strongly,
							saying it is not negotiable and that any effort to obtain alterations in
							it will simply lead to collapse of entire deal now agreed in principle.
							We have not tried to modify their draft and they will be wasting time
							trying to modify our factual statement of considered US position.<note n="2" xml:id="d328fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> agreed and
								intended to tell Pak “the statement is part of package and is not
								negotiable.” The Embassy also noted that Pak seemed unbothered by
								the statement at the last meeting and seemingly knew of it in
								advance from information passed by the Soviets. (Telegram 11850 from
								Seoul, December 18; ibid.)</note> If <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> prefers he could simply say that he is not
							authorized to make any changes in our statement.</p>

							Because of complexity of discussion on wide variety procedural and
							administrative questions we are dividing this message into two parts.
							The first deals with questions on which there was no substantial
							dispute. Second deals with disputed questions.</p>
                        <p>2. Non-Disputed Items.</p>
                        <p>A. Health of Crew—In response to Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s question, Gen Pak said crew in “normal
							condition”. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							interprets this to mean that crew is in good health.</p>
                        <p>B. Order of Release Across Bridge—Commander Bucher will cross first with
							body of Seaman Hodges and will identify body. Remainder of crew will
							cross in order of roster provided by <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>
							side; that is, lowest ranking personnel first.</p>
                        <p>C. Press—Our proposal that there be no more than 25 civilian press
							members from each side was accepted.</p>
                        <p>D. Other Personnel in Area—Agreement reached.</p>
                        <p>E. Statement at Time of Signing—<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss>s agreed
							to statement by General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> of our position but said that they would also
							make statement at same time.</p>
                        <p>F. Document To Be Signed—<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> will provide
							document in both English and Korean. Signature on Korean version to be
							at right of signature block. Signature on English version to be above
							signature block.</p>
                        <p>3. Disputed Items.</p>
                        <p>A. Two-hour Interval Between Signing and Release—General Pak held out for
							interval of two hours between signing and release. He insisted this was
							necessary to comply with <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> law and for
							administrative reasons.</p>
                        <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0771"/>
                        <p>B. Publicity—<gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> side offered Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> choice between no publicity
							until signature and arrangement which would leave each side free, once
							agreement reached, to respond to whatever other side said. During 30
							minute recess Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							conferred with Embassy on this point. We reached conclusion it
							preferable leave each side free as we could not prevent premature leaks
							once Breeches Buoy plan implemented. Our understanding of agreement is
							that <gloss target="#t_NK1">NK</gloss> will not issue official release
							until time of signature if our side does not issue official release. Gen
							Pak seemed unconcerned with prospect of press speculation.</p>
                        <p>C. Final Date and Time of Release—Pak insisted he did not have authority
							agree to date and time of release at 26th meeting. He said he would call
							another meeting in three or four days to confirm final agreement. Gen
								<persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> pressed him hard
							on this point, pointing out that if crew was to be home by Xmas with
							families final release no later than Dec 21 essential. Pak would not and
							obviously could not retreat but did say “We will do our best to realize
							your wish. If we cannot meet your wish it will be because of unavoidable
							administrative reasons.” It was agreed that final agreement would be
							reached at next meeting. Gen Pak also agreed to Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>'s proposal that signature
							take place at 0900 hours day following final agreement with release at
							1100 hours same day.</p>
                        <p>4. Gen <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> comments as
							follows: There is agreement on our proposal (B) and complete agreement
							on all procedural matters except for establishing date of final
							agreement. I considered it unusual for Pak to say he would do his best
							to meet my wishes for speedy next meeting.</p>

                        <p>On December 23, 1968, at 9 a.m. Korean time, General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> and General Pak met for the
							last time. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							opened the meeting, which lasted for 47 minutes, by making a brief
							statement and signing the documents as prearranged. The text of the
							document signed by General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName> on December 23 is in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 6, 1969, pages 2–3. After
							General Pak accepted and examined the signed documents, he accused the
							United States of having violated the agreement, charging that the
							Department of State had publicly announced the time of the release of
							the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew. Because of that announcement,
							General Pak stated that the time of the release of the crew must be
							renegotiated. General <persName corresp="#p_WMGGH1">Woodward</persName>
							disputed his claim, prompting General Pak to announce a delayed release
							time of 11:30 a.m., to which both sides agreed. The verbatim text of the
							meeting was transmitted in airgram A–890 from Seoul, December 26;

                        <p>At 11:30 a.m. on December 23, with two crew members carrying the body of
							the one sailor who died during attack on the ship, the 82 members of the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew walked in single file across the
							Bridge of No Return at Panmunjom into the southern section of the
							Demilitarized Zone, where they boarded buses and were taken to a nearby
							U.S. Army camp. Statements issued by President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary of State
								<persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> confirming the release
							are in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 6,
							1969, pages 1–2. At the U.S. Army camp Commander Bucher and other
							members of the crew held a brief press conference and met with
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PWJ1">Porter</persName> and several
							South Korean officials. (Telegram 11967 from Seoul, December 24;
							National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
							1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR N–US) At the press
							conference Commander Bucher stated that at no time had the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> entered North Korean territorial waters
							and described beatings and <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0773"/>abuse suffered by the men in captivity. (<hi rend="italic">The New
								York Times</hi>, December 23, 1968) After a brief stay at the Army
							camp, the crew was flown by helicopter to the 121st Evacuation Hospital
							on a U.S. Army base near Seoul for medical examination. The following
							day the hospital's commanding officer announced to the media that,
							although the examination revealed the aftereffects of beatings the men
							endured while in captivity and signs of malnutrition, the crew evinced
							no psychological damage requiring immediate treatment. The men were then
							released for return to the United States. (Telegram 1958 from Seoul,
							December 24; National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59,
							Central Files 1967–69, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 33–6 KOR
							N–US) From Seoul the crew flew to the Miramar Naval Air Station in San
							Diego, California, arriving on December 24. After being reunited with
							their families for the Christmas holidays, the men were given extensive
							medical and psychological examinations.</p>
                        <p>From talks with members of the crew the Navy gathered additional
							information and documented details of the physical abuse and
							mistreatment inflicted on the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> crew by the
							North Koreans. (Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MATJ1">Moorer</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_CC2">Clifford</persName>, December 24; Washington National Records Center,

							Blouin to the Chief of Naval Operations, December 26; Johnson Library,
							National Security File, Country File, Korea—Pueblo Incident, Filed by

							members was officially sanctioned, physical and psychological abuse was
							conducted systematically and during specific periods of the crew's
							captivity, the crew adjusted to the level of abuse they experienced, and
							the degree of physical violence inflicted on the men was deliberately
							controlled to prevent death and permanent injury to the captives.

                        <p>On December 26 in-depth intelligence debriefing of the crew members by

                        <p>After the debriefings were completed, a Naval Court of Inquiry convened
							on January 20, 1969, at the Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado,
							California, to investigate all circumstances surrounding the seizure and
							loss of the USS <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and to determine
							culpability, if warranted. According to the Navy, the Court of Inquiry
							was merely a fact-finding body, similar to a civilian grand jury, with
							authority to call witnesses, take sworn testimony in both open and
							closed sessions, and gather diverse forms of information. Testimony
							given during open sessions received extensive coverage in The New York
							Times, among other sources. The Court adjourned on March 13 and issued
							its findings on May 5.</p>
                        <p>The Court recommended bringing charges against Commander Bucher and
							Lieutenant Stephen Harris, the commanding officer of the Naval Security
							Group detachment on board the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>, and that
							both be tried by court martial. Commander Bucher faced charges of
							failing to protect and defend his ship, following North Korean orders to
							sail to their port, failing to properly train his crew to destroy
							classified material, failing to destroy that material upon capture, and
							permitting classified material to fall into enemy hands. Lieutenant
							Harris would be charged with failing to train his crew in emergency
							destruction procedures and failing to destroy classified material as
							ordered. The Court also recommended reprimanding the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>'s executive officer, Edward R. Murphy, for dereliction
							of duty and bringing charges against the Commander of Naval Forces,
							Japan, Rear Admiral Frank Johnson, and against the Director of the Naval
							Security Group, Pacific, Captain Everett Gladding, for failing to
							support and protect the ship adequately. Ultimately, the Secretary of
							the Navy, John Chaffee, overruled any further action against the
							officers, stating that the members of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
							crew had already endured enough suffering while held captive and
							warranted no further punishment and that charges against their supe-
							riors would also be dropped, since they were not solely responsible for
							failing to anticipate an attack on and the seizure of the ship. With
							that decision all further action by the Navy in the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> matter came to a close. (National Security Agency, <hi rend="italic">The Capture of the USS Pueblo and its Effect on SIGINT
								Operations</hi>, pages 164–165)</p>
                        <p>In addition to the Naval Court of Inquiry, a Joint Intelligence Team,
							composed of representatives from the Central Intelligence Agency,
							Defense Intelligence Agency, and the intelligence branches of the Navy,
							Air Force, and Army, assessed the impact on intelligence operations and
							programs resulting from the loss of the extensive number of
							messages—between 7 to 8,000 were analyzed—received by the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> prior to its capture. Its report
							determined that the loss of those documents gave the Communist world
							undue insight into United States intelligence-collection capabilities
							and represented a major compromise of <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0775"/>intelligence-gathering sources and methods in Southeast
							Asia. (“Damage Assessment of the Compromise of Operational Intelligence

							Assessment)</p>
                        <p>The National Security Agency also conducted an extensive review and
							analysis of the intelligence losses resulting from the seizure of the
								<hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and the detention of its crew. The
							resulting report was based first and foremost on the information
							gathered during the in-depth debriefing of the crew concerning the
							information and equipment on board the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and
							captured by the North Koreans as well as information imparted by crew
							members when interrogated during captivity. Analysts learned from the
							debriefing of the enormous number of documents and the full extent of
							the equipment that fell into North Korean hands intact or with minimal
							damage and of the intelligence information imparted by some of the crew
							members. The conclusions contained in the final report assessed the
							compromise to “the Cryptologic Community collection, processing and
							reporting operations/techniques on a worldwide basis is without
							precedence in U.S. cryptologic history.” The report also observed that
							cryptographic communications remained secure because of the continued
							inability of the North Koreans or others to decrypt messages “without
							cryptographic keys used in conjunction with the equipment.”

							January–23 December 1968,” March 1969, page 17; ibid., Carton VIII, <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> Files, Charts, Maps, Draft History, etc.)
							A full realization of intelligence losses resulting from the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> seizure emerged only in mid-1985 when the
							Walker spy ring, operated within the U.S. Navy by John Walker, his son
							Michael, and others, was discovered and found to have passed to the
							Soviet Union over an 18-year period a variety of information, including
							the keys to coded communications, allowing the Soviets to decrypt and
							read highly classified documents and transmissions. (National Security

                        <p>In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the examination of events
							surrounding the capture of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi> and its
							crew led to an overall evaluation of the intelligence-gathering program

                        <p>We feel now is more favorable time for settlement than we shall see again
							before 1965 at earliest. Quite apart from our belief that ability of new
							Korean Government to push through settlement will tend to decrease
							rather than increase with time, ratification of settlement before June
							adjournment of Diet offers best chance in Japan. If this opportunity
							missed, Diet recess together with Olympic fever would put off serious
							Diet consideration of settlement until 1965 at earliest. Meanwhile, July
							elections for <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> presidency would add
							new note of doubt. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> has fully
							committed himself to settlement and [garble] political skill needed to
							carry it through smoothly. While reelection of <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> seems probable, if Sato succeeded
								<persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> in July though he would
							be equally eager for settlement, he might find it harder to win
							ratification because of greater disunity within <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss>. If Kom, who has been showing increasing strength as
							candidate to replace <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>, were
							to be successor, outcome would be even more problematical since his
							attitude on many matters is not clear.</p>
                        <p>If ratification before July is necessary, time is running out. FonOff
							tells us that, after basic political agreement reached, two months will
							be required for drafting and then three months for Diet consideration.
							This perhaps too generous timetable would call for agreement before end
							of January, but we estimated agreement will be necessary by early March
							at latest if we are to catch present high tide.</p>
                        <p>We see little we can do at Tokyo end to speed settlement. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is perfectly aware of all points stated
							above and of intense US interest in settlement. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and Ohira have skillfully led
							Japanese public into accepting normalization as only common sense and
							consequently determined <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0778"/>Socialist opposition will probably not cause major problem. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has consistently made clear during
							negotiations what it considers negotiable and what not, we believe it
							will not retreat from 12-mile limit.<note n="3" xml:id="d332fn3">Reference is to the extent of Korean territorial waters.</note> Nor
							would it be consistent with basic US policy for us to try to persuade it
							to. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has shown flexibility on other
							issues and recently has proposed that fisheries negotiations be moved to
							Seoul to have Korean delegation near source of its instructions and thus
							speed up talks.</p>
                        <p>From here it appears that bars to settlement are on Korean end.
							Superficial one is unrealistic effort to avoid 12-mile limit. More basic
							problem is hostility of Korean public to Japan and therefore political
							danger for a government that makes settlement. This admittedly makes
							settlement terribly difficult, but unless we find way to help Koreans
							surmount this problem, we may miss tide, which may not rise this high
							again for some time.</p>
                        <p>Conceivably <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government has idea that
							time is on their side (e.g., that <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> will be Prime Minister and will give them better
							deal than <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName>). If so, it might
							be helpful for us to disabuse them of such notions and point out clearly
							our estimate that failure to get settlement now would result in long
							delay with no prospect of any better terms from Japan in future.</p>

                        <p>(Here Ambassador Kim read the statement, as follows:</p>
                        <p>“1. It is the consistent policy of the Korean Government to seek an early
							normalization of the relations between Korea and Japan with a view to
							establishing good neighbourly relations and strengthening the solidarity
							among free nations. It is, however, to be noted that the Korea-Japan
							Talks has become a domestic political issue because of the past
							relations of the two countries and the critical attitude of some
							opposition parties. It is, therefore, hoped that a full consideration be
							given to these facts, and accordingly a broader approach be made by
							Japan in the Talks.</p>
                        <p>“2. Following is the basic position of the Korean Government on the
							fishery question which is the main pending issue: a) the fishery
							resources in the waters in question be conserved; b) interests of the
							Korean fishing population be safeguarded, and the Korean fishing
							industry be protected from any adverse effects of Japanese fishing
							activities.</p>
                        <p>“3. One of the major obstacles to the settlement of this question is the
							great imbalance of fishing capabilities between the two countries.
							Therefore, a sufficient amount of fishery cooperation fund should be
							secured for the development of Korean fishing industry. Accordingly, it
							is considered that the practical means of settling the fishery question
							are for Japan to agree to regulatory measures limiting Japanese fishing
							activities within the Peace Line<note n="3" xml:id="d333fn3">In 1952
								former President Syngman Rhee created the Peace Line, also referred

							and to render a full fishery cooperation. If Japan intends to increase
							fishing activities within the Peace Line through the conclusion of a
							fishery agreement <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"/>or insists on
							any regulatory measures under which such an increase is anticipated, the
							settlement of the question will become difficult.</p>
                        <p>“4. There are expressed apprehensions among the Korean people that, when
							the Korea-Japan relations are normalized, the role of the United States
							of America in supporting Korea would be shifted to Japan. Therefore, a
							reassurance by the United States of continuous support to Korea is
							necessary.”)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the reference to “domestic political issue”
							in the first paragraph of the text referred to domestic problems in
							Korea, Japan, or both. Ambassador Kim said that both countries were
							intended. In Korea it was the Government several years ago which had
							held back in the negotiations for a settlement while the Opposition
							Party and the Korean people favored coming to a conclusion. The
							situation was now reversed. In Japan the public was likewise not fully
							in agreement on a settlement.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the second and third paragraphs relating to the fisheries
							question, the Secretary asked how much fishing was done by the Japanese
							within the “Peace Line”. The Ambassador replied that, according to
							Japanese figures, roughly 120 thousand tons are taken annually by
							Japanese vessels within the area enclosed by the Line. The Japanese have
							informed the Korean Delegation in Tokyo of the results of their fishing
							operations. The Koreans have agreed that the same amount could be caught
							by the Japanese in the future but warned that any increase would create
							a problem. The Secretary asked whether the Koreans would expect to raise
							their catch to the Japanese level or to limit their catch to the present
							volume for conservation reasons. Ambassador Kim said that the Koreans
							contemplated an increase in their catch but would need improved
							equipment which they would expect the Japanese to provide by way of
							compensation for Korean agreement to Japanese fishing within the Peace
							Line.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought that it would be important to determine with as
							much precision as possible the figures on the total catch of each
							country and on the maximum permissible catch. He asked whether
							Korean-caught fish is sold principally in Korea or in Japan and whether
							any third country engages in fishing within the Peace Line. Ambassador
							Kim said that Korean fishermen sell their catch largely in Japan. He
							added that the Russians did not fish within the Line although seven
							years ago Chinese Communists had come close to Korea and had sunk a
							Korean fishing boat besides capturing a Korean fisherman. The Korean
							armed forces had orders to sink such invaders and the Chinese
							Communists' vessel was chased but because of darkness could not be
							found.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Kim expressed the hope that United States assistance and
							support would be assured as noted in the final paragraph of the <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0781"/>statement. The Secretary
							replied that the United States would hope that normalization of
							relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan would result in
							cooperation between the two countries which would be beneficial to both,
							but that the United States had no intention to discontinue its support
							of the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>(On leaving, Ambassador Kim left with Department officers a copy of his
							statement “for informal reference”, not as an aide-memoire.)</p>

                        <p>The Secretary invited Ohira to assess prospects for a Japanese-Korean
							settlement. He said that Washington had not entered into discussion of
							details of the settlement but was greatly interested in the outcome of
							negotiations. In effect, Washington wanted an agreement and did not much
							care on what basis.</p>
                        <p>Ohira said that the Japanese and Koreans had gone over the hump when they
							had achieved agreement on claims. The focus of negotiations now was on
							the fisheries issue: width of the exclusive zone, regulation of the
							“outside” zone, and fisheries cooperation. Japan had made certain
							proposals to Korea and, as of this moment difficulties were on the
							Korean and not the Japanese side. Ohira felt that Pak was being too much
							intimidated by the opposition and that he could overcome it just as the
								<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> was determined to override its
							domestic opposition on the normalization issue. Ohira went on to explain
							that Japan's proposals on the fisheries issue were subject to flexible
							negotiations. If this matter could be wound up others could easily be
							disposed of. The Secretary urged flexibility on both sides, expressed
							conviction there was room for maneuvering and hoped for an early
							conclusion of the settlement. Ohira said if there was some way he
							believed the Secretary could be helped in advising Seoul he would pass
							along his suggestions.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Remaining major obstacles to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
							settlement are fisheries control in restricted areas and amount of
							fisheries cooperation loans. On basis our discussions in Seoul and
							Embassy Tokyo's reports (Tokyo's 2390 and 2400 to Dept)<note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">See <ref target="#d336fn2">footnote 2, Document
									336</ref>.</note> both problems appear negotiable although
							important differences still separate two sides. On question of fisheries
							cooperation loans we believe a Japanese offer of 60–70 million dollars
							over given period (perhaps 4–5 years) would meet <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> needs.</p>
                        <p>2. Fisheries control issue is much more complicated. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> willing to accept de facto 12 mile
							limit but insists that Japanese fishing effort in key areas [garble]
							Peace Line and 12 mile limit be kept at or only moderately above current
							limits for a few years during which (with help <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> fisheries loans) <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
							fleet could be expanded and modernized. Absence of agreed historical
							catch data and of agreed standards for limiting Japanese fishing effort
							by number and types of vessels and duration of their operations are
							obstructing settlement. Also <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							wishes to draw 12 mile limit in manner which <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> considers would take in too much of open sea.</p>
                        <p>3. Koreans have indicated that there is flexibility in their position.
							FonMin has stated that government has fall-back positions on delineation
							of 12 mile zone and restricted areas, conceding to Japanese some of
							disputed areas around Cheju Island. FonOff sources have also implied
							willingness to consider modification of current proposals to limit
							number of Japanese craft within restricted area if <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> would present statistical support for
							number of craft it claims are currently fishing within Peace Line.</p>
                        <p>4. In view complexity of fisheries problem, and all possible permutations
							which can enter into a compromise, I do not believe it possible for
							third party to formulate with precision detailed terms on which a
							settlement can be reached. Detached formal agreement can only be reached
							by two govts concerned on basis present negotiations. If we attempted to
							put forth a specific formula, even on one time basis, we would soon find
							ourselves caught in middle and involved in mediating <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0785"/>technical questions. Therefore we
							cannot guarantee that single intervention on our part along lines reftel
							would be successful.</p>
                        <p>5. Our intervention, if attempted should be designed get negotiations
							going at a level which gives promise of success. This requires a
							decision on both sides to resolve fishery issues at a high political
							level.</p>
                        <p>6. I therefore propose that Amb <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> and I be instructed to approach respective
							govts and urge them to schedule an early meeting of such persons as can
							negotiate with full powers, whether at FonMinister or other levels. We
							should urge Koreans to move ahead regardless of internal political
							opposition, and urge Japanese to be as magnanimous as possible.</p>
                        <p>7. Our representation to <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> might
							usefully urge:</p>
                        <p>A. Commitment to $70 million in fishery cooperation loans.</p>
                        <p>B. Agreement by Japanese to restrict fishing effort for temporary period
							to something near current level.</p>
                        <p>Our representation to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should urge
							on them:</p>
                        <p>A. Delineation of 12-mile limit in manner approximating international
							practice.</p>
                        <p>B. To avoid injecting any new demands into overall negotiations.</p>
                        <p>8. I put above suggestions forward in conviction that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should move forcibly to convince both
							govts of need to act now, and that normalization will not come about if
							both sides continue to haggle about details.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he had invited Ambassador Takeuchi in to express
							again our very great interest in a Japan-Korea normalization agreement.
							He had left his conversations with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> and President Pak with the strong
							impression that both really wanted agreement and believed that recent
							developments were conducive to finalization of an agreement in time to
							permit ratification during the present Diet session. Both capitals might
							think we were pressing hard but the advantages of a settlement for all
							of us are so great that as agreement appeared in sight “one could almost
							taste it”. The Secretary said that he would appreciate the Ambassador's
							passing on to Foreign Minister Ohira the importance we attach to
							conclusion of the agreement this spring if at all possible. Noting that
							he had made the same points to Ambassador Kim,<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> met with Kim on February
								28; telegram 758 to Seoul, February 28, contains a summary of their
								conversation. (Ibid.)</note> the Secretary asked if Ambassador
							Takeuchi had any late information on the progress of the
							negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Takeuchi said that he had received a cable the previous day
							responding to his request for such information. Claims were considered
							the main issue on the Korean side, and the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> felt strongly it had done its best. The next most
							important problem was fisheries. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
							is ready to negotiate but wants more progress at the working level on
							the technical problems involved before raising the matter to the
							political level as the Koreans appear to desire. Progress had appeared
							possible until about a month ago when the Korean side began to show
							itself unwilling to move ahead in the technical negotiations, and
							instead to push for a political settlement. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> considered political-level discussions unsuitable now
							due to the highly technical nature of the problem, centering in three
							issues:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Twelve-mile Base Line</hi>—The <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is making unreasonable demands. Their
							proposed line would embrace areas which, if the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> were to agree, would set a bad precedent for Japanese
							fishing arrangements with other countries.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Number of Boats</hi>—The Koreans are proposing a
							very limited number based on arbitrary, totally unacceptable
							calculations. Both Governments agreed to respect present practices but
							the Korean proposal violates this understanding. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> will not agree to any proposal which
							would result in a reduction of the present Japanese catch in the
							affected areas.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Fisheries' Cooperation</hi>—This issue is less
							troublesome, but the Koreans requested $178,000,000. Although the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is unable to increase the previously
							agreed grant and long-term, low-interest loan figures, <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0787"/>it is prepared to agree to normal
							commercial loans, provided the over- all fisheries issue is solved in a
							satisfactory way.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Takeuchi reiterated that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> considers further negotiation at the expert level
							necessary. Political level discussions could not resolve the technical
							issues involved, at least until the outlines of an agreement have been
							reached.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether it might be feasible to schedule both
							technical and political discussions in relation to each other, so each
							side could enter into the kind of discussions it wants. Ambassador
							Takeuchi replied that the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> fears that
							if political level discussions were entered into, the Koreans would be
							encouraged to neglect the working level negotiations. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> is concerned by the Korean attitude of
							almost boycotting the technical negotiations and insisting instead on
							political negotiations. The <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, having
							gone far to meet Korean desires in a political settlement of the claims
							issue, considers sincere negotiations at the technical level essential
							on fisheries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Takeuchi said that Japanese fishing interests are exerting
							strong pressures. They are afraid that the Foreign Office will
							compromise their interests. The Agriculture Minister had called on Mr.
							Ohira formally to call his attention to this aspect, making it difficult
							for the Foreign Office to show flexibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRW1">Barnett</persName> said that it was our
							understanding from recent reports that all relevant fisheries
							considerations are now on the table, with little or no further
							“research” necessary. Technicians tend to become obsessed with technical
							aspects. The will to agree seems strong on both sides and the gap
							relatively manageable if dealt with concurrently at the technical and
							political levels as the Secretary had suggested. Ambassador Takeuchi
							said that there had been prospects of working level agreement but
							recently the atmosphere had changed, possibly due to internal
							difficulties on the Korean side. The Koreans are proposing that the
							exclusive Korean fisheries zone be extended far out into the open sea,
							almost to the Rhee line.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it had been his experience that when experts
							differed, the solution sometimes was for ministers to tell them to
							resume their discussions and come up with a solution. This was well
							illustrated by the experience of technicians and ministers in the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss> negotiations. Ambassador Takeuchi
							said that he believed Foreign Minister Ohira's role to be one of key
							importance, particularly with the Agriculture Minister subject to
							fishing industry pressures. Perhaps it would be a very good thing to
							meet at a higher level, but this was not the present position of his
							Government. The Secretary asked whether it might be useful to set a date
							now for a meeting at the Foreign Ministers level and to establish a
							preparatory committee to prepare for that meeting. Ambassador Takeuchi
							saw advantages to such a procedure <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0788"/>but feared that if the preparatory committee failed to
							make progress and an abortive meeting of Foreign Ministers took place it
							could make a bad impression.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed appreciation for the information Ambassador
							Takeuchi had provided and asked him to convey to Foreign Minister Ohira
							the U.S. Government's hopes for an early Japan-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> settlement.</p>

                        <p>In March and April 1964 Korean and Japanese Cabinet Ministers met to try
							to resolve the fisheries question and normalization of relations. Plans
							for talks were underway when the Embassy in Seoul reported that both
							sides were “apparently determined to make full effort achieve
							settlement,” and the Korean Foreign Minister foresaw an agreement being
							reached by the middle of April. (Telegram 1118 from Seoul, March 5;
							National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
							1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 7 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>As negotiators wrestled with outstanding issues, student demonstrations
							erupted in Korea on March 24 to protest the impending settlement and the
							involvement of Assemblyman and Chairman of the Democratic Republican
							party <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> in the
							negotiations. (Telegram 1244 from Seoul, March 30; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 23–8 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Embassy reported the demonstrations “revealed
							widespread public fears of subsequent Japanese domination as well as
							misgivings about terms of settlement and dissatisfaction with way
							negotiations conducted.” That situation coupled with strengthening
							political opposition led to speculation that the Pak government could be
							overthrown. (Telegram 1277 from Seoul, April 10; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> JAPAN–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</p>
                        <p>The combination of circumstances brought negotiations to a standstill.
							Concomitantly, unabated, escalating student demonstrations against the
							settlement, government corruption, the belief that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-pil</persName> would profit financially
							from an agreement with Japan, and similar issues strained
							Korean-Japanese relations and resulted in the imposition in Seoul of
							martial law on June 3. Seoul remained under martial law for 56 days; the
							order was revoked on July 28. Relevant documents are ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 2 KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>;

                        <p>The 86-year old Yoshida, our favorite Japanese Prime Minister back in the
							'50s, is a doughty, anti-Communist, pro-Westerner. However, he's a good
							deal more so than most Japanese including the present <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>. So take whatever he says with a grain of
							salt.</p>
                        <p>I'd urge you simply mention to both Yoshida and the Korean <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> our great hope for a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Jap settlement and the long-awaited

                        <p>1029. 1. Department believes that in this crucial period of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese negotiations careful
							consideration should again be given to possibility of US initiative
							which might help to drive agreement over the top. Although Department
							has always been willing consider useful initiatives enhancing
							possibilities of agreement, conclusion to date has been that any sign of
							US “interference” would be counter-productive. It remains of utmost
							importance that terms of settlement be arrived at by two parties on
							their own responsibility. Care must be taken to avoid any appearance
							that Japan settled at behest of US, and on Korean side we should
							carefully avoid appearance of inducing <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to “knuckle under” to Japanese.</p>
                        <p>2. Serious obstacles to full and final agreement nevertheless lie on
							Korean side. Korean Opposition, recognizing <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s lack of popularity, has seized on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan negotiations issue to try to
							bring Government down, playing in part upon suspicions that <persName corresp="#p_KCKC1">Kim Chong-p'il</persName> and others have, or
							hope to, profit personally from settlement. Underlying political
							maneuverings and emotional attitudes appear to be two widespread fears:
							1) fear of Japanese domination, but little appreciation of economic
							benefits of normal relationship with Japan, and 2) fear that with
							normalization US would attempt shift burden of Korea to Japan and
							perhaps “abandon” Korea. Overcoming first problem requires education and
							experience on which only limited gains possible in short time. We
							wonder, however, if there is some action US might take at this time
							which might help significantly to dispel fears that we hope to unload
							Korea on Japan. New Cabinet's professed intention resume negotiations
								(<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1453)<note n="2" xml:id="d341fn2">Telegram 1453 from Seoul, May 11, contained
								comments made by newly appointed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_CICI1">Chong Il-kwon</persName> outlining the aims
								of the new Cabinet, including his statement that “<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan talks will be actively
								pursued.” (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 15–1 KOR
									<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> may offer favorable
							opportunity for such action.</p>
                        <p>3. One possible action for your consideration and comment with
							understanding that it has not been fully cleared in <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be: Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BSD1">Berger</persName> would inform <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be prepared to announce upon successful
							conclusion of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> negotiations that subject to
							parliamentary ratification of settlement <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will support <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0791"/>an expanded Korean capital development program, specifically (1) Take
							initiative in seeking to form international aid consultative group for
							Korea to broaden, enlarge and coordinate capital assistance to Korea;
							(2) Establish a $100 million <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
							development lending program with goal of allocating funds for
							development projects and capital goods import programs over a two-year
							period, in consultation with other lenders; (3) Continue basic economic
							support of a sustained Korean financial stabilization policy through
							adequate provision of Supporting Assistance and PL 480. Development
							lending program assumes, of course, unprecedented Korean effort in
							development acceptable projects which US, Japan, International Agencies
							and other members of consultative group could help finance. Expansion of
							US development lending also assumes parallel expansion of availability
							additional local funds. Recognizing profound effects on stabilization
							effort and counterpart allocations of such an expanded inflow of
							capital, we need your assessment advantages and disadvantages such
								<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> public commitment.</p>
                        <p>4. In suggesting to Koreans possibility of offer, we would hope that
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> would see it as means to
							obtain needed additional popular support to help conclude <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan settlement, and to overcome
							current lack of confidence in government. We recognize of course danger
							that <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>, instead of being encouraged
							by our offer to move to immediate settlement, might bargain for more
							favorable offer, or even worse, regard offer as substitute for Japan
							settlement. Fact is, however, utility of offer is dependent, as
							practical matter, upon establishment of new relationship with Japan and
							availability Japanese resources, especially as far as Korean trade
							expansion prospects concerned. We must be prepared therefore to say
							offer will not stand unless settlement reached. Embassy Tokyo meanwhile
							must appraise impact this type offer on Japan's motivations in settling
							affairs with Korea, and possible Japanese fears that we intend to
							“manage” their aid.</p>
                        <p>5. Request comment and suggestions from both addressee Embassies.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">In telegram 1521 from Seoul, May 21,

							possibility achieving “limited” normalization <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan relations in period immediately following <gloss target="#t_LDP1">LDP</gloss> election assuming <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Ikeda</persName> again elected party president.
								<persName>Chong</persName> envisages exchange full diplomatic
							missions and simultaneous agreement on part of Japanese to liberalize
							imports from Korea.<note n="2" xml:id="d343fn2">In response the Embassy
								in Tokyo reported that with regard to “limited” or “partial
								normalization” the Japanese Government “has always favored such a
								step and would welcome it now.” The Japanese were also willing to
								accept a diplomatic mission, rather than a full-scale embassy, in
								Korea. The imports question was a problem because the Japanese were
								reluctant “to permit increased imports Korean marine products as
								long as Rhee Line issue unresolved and because of opposition from
								Diet members with ties to industries concerned.” (Telegram 3987 from
								Tokyo, June 29; ibid.)</note> Once normal diplomatic relations
							established under such arrangement full settlement pending issues could
							proceed in less controversial manner.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName>Chong</persName> expressed belief it would not be possible
							secure full settlement this year under present procedures. He was
							concerned that indefinite postponement normalization would lead to
							growth of two Koreas concept in Japan and greatly weaken <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> position. Therefore wanted to push
							ahead quickly to limited goal and hoped for US support.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName>Chong</persName> believes overt participation by US in such
							a limited settlement would ensure widest acceptance in Korea.<note n="3" xml:id="d343fn3">The Embassy noted Japanese wariness of overt U.S.
								participation, which would have to be credibly justified to the
								Japanese people, advising “that generally speaking the less overt US
								involvement the better.” (Ibid.)</note> Opposition some time ago

							short-term goal and US support would simplify govt's task.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName>Chong</persName> will discuss his proposal with President

                        <p>Here's a strong plug for Marshall <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>'s idea that we shoot for a limited <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Jap normalization, so long as prospects

							shortly to establish normal relations and reach a settlement with Japan.
							It is not healthy for Korea to continue long to be so exclusively
							dependent upon a single outside friend as it is at present. Korea needs
							greater trade and a wider circle of strong supporters from abroad. A
							settlement would be of great benefit to Korea, both economically and
							politically, and would have good effects for Korea far beyond the direct
							arrangements established between Korea and Japan. It would also benefit
							the Free World position in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>The President hopes that delays will not continue, fearing that Korea's
							diplomatic and economic prospects and the Free World position in Asia
							will deteriorate unless this normalization is soon achieved. The United
							States Government is prepared publicly to support such a settlement, and
							to make clear that it will not affect the basic United States policies
							of economic assistance to Korea. In fact, such a settlement would make
							United States assistance more fruitful, for it would be working in a
							stronger and more broadly based economy.</p>
                        <p>It is because the President holds these views strongly that he authorized

                        <p>So I can't throw much light on your earlier comment that you didn't know

								Brown's August 17 meeting with the Korean Foreign Minister, Prime
								Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister. (Ibid.) Telegram 158 from

                        <p>1. It is clear from conversations with key figures reported reftels that
							differences of view exist within <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							on how to best achieve objective Korea-Japan normalization. Foreign
							Minister wishes to program strategy for gaining full normalization,
							while Prime Minister proposes more modest goal of partial normalization.
							President Pak takes somewhat middle ground in that he supports attempt
							achieve full normalization but is prepared reconsider and accept
							something less if circumstances so dictate.</p>
                        <p>2. I believe President's position realistic and practical in that failure
							achieve full normalization will not preclude shifting objective to
							lesser goal if that becomes necessary. I do not, however, believe we
							should abandon preference for full normalization without full test of
								possibility.<note n="3" xml:id="d347fn3">Reischauer agreed with this
								approach as well as with recommendations A, B, and D contained in
								paragraph 4. (Telegram 641 from Tokyo, August 20; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> JAPAN–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister appear convinced <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> cannot simply reach agreement with
							Japan, then force its acceptance by use govt majority in Assembly and
							without “prudent regard” (Pak's expression) to public opinion. I agree
							and believe that we should gauge our actions and support with this in
							mind.</p>
                        <p>4. I recommend we pursue following courses of action at this time:</p>
                        <p>A. Embassy Tokyo explore possibility early Yoshida good will visit to
							Seoul. We believe such visit would give substantial boost to govt
							efforts improve public attitudes and make easier resumption full scale
							negotiations. If Japanese response favorable we would arrange <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> invitation. We can accept President
							Pak's and Yi Tong-won's assurance Yoshida would be received with
							respect.</p>
                        <p>B. We should proceed with plans from DAC coordinating group. We will
							discuss subject intensively with <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							in next few days and <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0799"/>believe we
							can obtain <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> agreement make formal
							request. Public disclosure these efforts should await further
							consideration as to best timing in relation to resumption of
							negotiations when domestic political reactions may again present problem
							to <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. We should discuss with Japanese and Koreans feasibility and utility
							arranging meeting of US, Japanese and Korean leaders to promote
							resumption negotiations. We should make clear US not taking on role of
							mediator, arbitrator or co-negotiator. I have in mind possible meeting
							in September between Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Shiina and high <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> figure (Yi Tong-won or someone else). Alternatively we
							could think in terms similar meeting at time Asst. Secretary
								<persName>Bundy</persName> will be in area. Whether meeting should
							be in Tokyo or Seoul needs to be determined. Koreans would prefer Seoul,
							but if Yoshida visit precedes, they may more readily accept Tokyo
								meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d347fn4">Reischauer expressed “grave
								doubts” about a tripartite meeting, because its value in Korea
								depended on public knowledge of the simultaneous visit by
								high-ranking U.S. and Japanese officials. He indicated that such a
								meeting, although assisting Korea, would have “seriously adverse
								effects in Japan.” In Reischauer's view it could not occur without
								“creating impression US 'intervening' directly in negotiations,
								which we still feel is most unwise” and would give the Japanese
								leftists an issue to exploit, thus significantly hindering the
								Japanese Government from making “conciliatory moves toward Koreans
								and complicating problem of ratification.” Reischauer was not
								opposed to a visit by a U.S. official, as long as it did not
								coincide with the Shiina visit. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> should be encouraged activate
							early campaign secure maximum public, press and opposition acceptance
							need for normalization on realistic terms. We can help discreetly with
							key opposition figures, especially if govt makes serious attempt to
							bring opposition along, e.g. by including leading opposition or
							non-partisan [garble] <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> del when
							negotiations resumed.</p>
                        <p>5. Above recommendations are not meant to imply substantially greater US
							role in resolving specific differences between Korea and Japan, but
							rather to improve atmosphere for resumption negotiations. I recognize
							that they may be construed as direct involvement, and that efforts will
							be made to draw us into such a role. On balance I believe we should take
							such risk. Past efforts in which we careful to remain in background have
							not ended in success, through no fault of ours. If we are to make new
							effort now, we should be prepared to extend ourselves and our
							involvement within carefully predetermined limits.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mac:</p>
                        <p>In reply to your note of August 13,<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">In his
								letter to Reischauer <persName>Bundy</persName> underscored the
								importance President <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
								placed on realizing a settlement and normalization of relations
								between Japan and Korea and the central role to be played by each
								Embassy in achieving those objectives. (Ibid.)</note> let me say
							that the message on Korean normalization brought by Win <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> from the White House got through
							to us loud and clear.</p>
                        <p>Actually this problem has always stood at the top of my list of
							priorities. During a visit to Korea in the autumn of 1960, I became
							convinced that, without the economic boost that Korean-Japanese
							normalization would bring to Korea, we would never be able to build a
							solid economic foundation on which a viable political regime could
							develop there. I promised certain Korean leaders that I would try to
							convince people in Washington of this when I got back. I was in
							Washington for this purpose in January 1961 when the Department asked me
							to take my present job. So you see I have appreciated the vital
							importance of this problem for a long time.</p>
                        <p>A major difficulty is that, to get normalization over the very great
							hurdles of party conflict and public opposition in Korea, we will
							probably have to push more openly for it in Korea than we have in the
							past, but any seeming intervention on our part makes the problem more
							difficult in Japan. This situation requires a careful balancing act
							between needs in Korea and risks in Japan. However, we do have a
							considerable margin of safety on the issue here, so I believe it may be
							possible to put on the needed pressure in Korea without building up
							unacceptable reactions here. Still it remains a delicate political
							operation to determine just what is the maximum degree of pressure we
							can safely exert. The present exchange of telegrams (see our 641, for
								example)<note n="3" xml:id="d348fn3">See <ref target="#d347fn3">footnotes 3 and 4, Document 347</ref>.</note> is directed
							toward this end.</p>
                        <p>In any case, please rest assured that we here in Tokyo regard the whole
							normalization problem as being of the greatest importance and are
							prepared to do everything we can and run considerable risks to get it
							satisfactorily solved.</p>

                        <p>1. Japanese are ready to continue negotiations with Koreans at any time
							Koreans feel able to negotiate. Japanese could continue from where
							negotiations ended last April because of internal Korean political
							problems, but are more skeptical than ever of Korean ability to make
							agreement and obtain domestic Korean support for it. While Japanese are
							probably ready to make certain limited steps and gestures for the sake
							of improving atmosphere, they feel that these will have little
							appreciable effect until <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>
							determined to make settlement and judges it can politically survive
							attempt. This they feel is and always has been the basic problem.
							Conciliatory steps and gestures made at a time when there is no hope for
							normalization, they feel, uses up ammunition that might better be used
							at more propitious time.</p>
                        <p>2. After years of urging on our part, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
							made firm decision in 1962 to push ahead toward Korean settlement as
							necessary in Japan's own interests. The then FonMin Ohira told
							Ambassador of this determination, and urged us not to push <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> but let Japanese do it in their own way
							and at their own pace. He argued that US pressure ran danger of being
							counterproductive in Japan, and that <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
							fully determined to see matter through. Although in August 1962 Ohira
							had said $70 million in claims was maximum figure (with Finance Ministry
							proposing $10 million) (Embtel 295, Aug 1, 1962),<note n="3" xml:id="d349fn3">Not printed. (National Archives and Records
								Administration, RG 59, Decimal File 694.95B/8–162)</note> by
							December Ohira had delivered on his commitment in Kim-Ohira agreement by
							raising figure to $500 million (grant plus easy loans). <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> considered this major Japanese
							concession. It was expected at time that this would soon be followed by
							fishery settlement, which would be major Korean concession since it was
							generally understood that worldwide fishing position gave Japanese only
							limited room for concessions here. Ikeda and Ohira skillfully worked on
							Japanese public until there was general acceptance of normalization
							concept even though it had originally been very unpopular <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0802"/>with Japanese public and opposition
							still promised an allout fight to block it. Meanwhile, however, Koreans
							did not come through on fishery settlement and demanded an additional
							financial settlement tied to it and various other sweeteners. On whole
								<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> has been forebearing and has
							agreed to additional fisheries financial aid and to various other
							gestures not contemplated in original deal. <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>, however, has noted that this forebearance and
							occasional additional concessions, while helpful no doubt to atmosphere
							of negotiations, have not overcome basic problem of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss>'s unwillingness to risk settlement.
							Hence <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>'s skepticism regarding further
							concessions is not surprising.</p>
                        <p>3. We intend to keep urging <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to be as
							tolerant and magnanimous as possible. Further import relaxations and
							extension of more credits on better terms would be desirable both to
							help improve atmosphere and to increase economic relationship during
							interim period before normalization. Increase in training programs for
							Koreans in Japan might also be helpful but only over longer period. In
							return, expansion and regularization of Japanese representation in Seoul
							and ending of boat seizures<note n="4" xml:id="d349fn4">The Koreans
								regularly seized Japanese fishing vessels alleged to have breached
								the so-called Peace Line or to have violated Korea's 12-mile
								territorial-waters boundary. The Japanese recognized a 3-mile limit
								on territorial waters. (Telegram 899 from Tokyo, September 10;
								ibid., Central Files 1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
								JAPAN–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) In a discussion of the
								issue with Brown, Pak explained that the Japanese were at this point
								sending more boats and penetrating deeper into Korean waters than
								earlier, thus the incidents were likely to continue until an
								agreement resolved the dispute. (Airgram A–163 from Seoul, September
								17; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> 1 JAPAN–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> would be helpful here and would
							encourage <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> to make larger
							concessions. Clear Japanese apology for their colonial oppression of
							Korea in past would, of course, make major contribution to improved
							Korean attitude toward Japan, but after many years of urging Japanese in
							and out of Government to do this, Ambassador has concluded that maximum
							Japanese statement, if obtainable, might do more harm than good.
							Japanese officials and public simply do not feel they owe any apology to
							Korea. Goodwill visit by figure like Yoshida, while running some risk
							because of Yoshida's unpredictability, would probably be useful, since
							it could be interpreted by Koreans as meaning a great deal more than
							Japanese intended. However, <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
							obviously feels that this is not time for major gestures like Yoshida
							visit or substantial relaxation of restrictions on imports and that
							these should be reserved for a time when such major gestures had more
							hope of getting negotiations over final hump. We also conclude from Emb
							Seoul's recent telegrams that such gestures would probably not be
							helpful in overcoming the main hurdle to normalization, which is
							unwillingness of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to risk
							settlement.</p>
                        <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0803"/>
                        <p>4. As we see situation, primary need is to find means 1) to persuade
							Koreans that normalization is absolutely necessary for Korea and 2)
							convince leaders they can carry it out without committing political
							suicide. Are there arguments, guarantees, promises or gestures that we
							can make to convince the government and people of the first proposition
							and the government of the latter? When we see our way to clearing the
							major hurdle of <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> unwillingness to
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> [reach] a settlement, then would
							be the effective time to pull out all the stops as described in para 3
							to improve the atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>5. One point that we should think about ourselves and possibly use with
							the Koreans is that time may be running out on them in terms of Japanese
							attitudes. While Japanese political situation now stable and Japanese
							public willing to accept normalization with Korea on terms Kim-Ohira
							settlement, this situation could change for the worse. So far Japanese
							have accepted with some bitterness this public condemnation Korean
							refusal to permit establishment Japanese mission in Seoul similar to
							Korean mission in Tokyo as Koreans had promised at signing of peace
							treaty, Korean refusal to reciprocate Japanese gestures, and statements
							by Korean leaders that Japan not sincere in negotiating with Koreans.
							However, over the years Japanese sense of nationalism has been growing.
							The time may not be too far distant when this nationalism may rise to
							point where further seizures of Japanese fishing vessels would raise
							public storm requiring <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> protect its
							boats by force. It should also be noted that both signers of the
							financial agreement (Ohira and Kim Chong p'il) are now no longer in
							their administrations. While we believe Ikeda will continue to honor
							Kim-Ohira agreement, we cannot predict what position of a new primin
							would be. On whole Japanese public opinion is likely to become less
							rather than more conciliatory toward Korea and demand may arise even for
							renegotiation of financial settlement.</p>
                        <p>6. One important factor in persuading <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> to go ahead with settlement might be high level US
							visit to Korea or other intervention. In this connection we should
							remember that an important factor in <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss>
							success in winning Japanese public acquiescence in Korean settlement has
							been argument that this is being done by Japan in its own interest. US
							intervention in settlement would lend credence to opposition charges
							that settlement made at behest of US and is first step in Japanese
							adherence to SEATO, thereby making position of <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> much more difficult. We therefore should be careful to
							see that any US intervention should not be in terms of mediation between
							Japan and Korea. Such visit, confined to Korea, would be to convince the
							Korean Government, political opposition and public of desirability of an
							agreement with Japan and to assure the Koreans that after this agreement
							the US will not leave them to the mercies of the Japanese.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>This is the first letter in the bi-weekly series which you asked us to
							provide covering developments related to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan normalization. As you suggested I will seek to
							record nuances in the Korean atmosphere which may not be apparent from
							cable reports.</p>
                        <p>The Korean Government, and more particularly Foreign Minister Yi
							Tong-won, remain determined to resume negotiations as soon as possible.
							Yi has made clear his time-table. He hopes the Shiina visit to Seoul
							will occur in November and be followed immediately by a resumption of
							negotiations in Tokyo. He is also prepared to stop in Tokyo in December
							on his way back from Germany, to lend his own voice to resolving
							differences. Certain authoritative voices now speak of a settlement
							agreement being signed next spring.</p>
                        <p>The new <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Ambassador to Tokyo, Kim
							Tong-cho, will be working to this schedule. He arrived in Tokyo on
							October 20 carrying a letter of invitation to Shiina. Kim has told me
							that he intends to re-open negotiations with the Japanese at the point
							where they were broken off last spring. This appears reassuring because
							it implies that no attempt will be made to re-open those aspects of the
							financial settlement already agreed in the Kim-Ohira memorandum. It also
							would appear to recognize the need to conduct the fisheries negotiations
							with due regard to what has already been accomplished. That means
							negotiations on base lines, restricted zones, and economic cooperation
							in much the same manner as appeared acceptable to the Japanese
							earlier.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I am not inclined to accept Kim's statement completely
							at face value. There are indications that the Koreans will seek to gain
							maximum concessions from Japan in connection with remaining differences
							and there may be some retreat from previous positions. Moreover, there
							continues to be pressure for re-opening the Kim-Ohira agreement, most
							strongly from the opposition but also to a certain extent from people in
							the government party.</p>
                        <p>The fisheries-Peace Line problem remains critical. Excitement over
							Japanese fishing inside the Peace Line has died down but could flare up
							at any moment. We have been urging moderation and I believe <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0805"/>with some success. At the moment the
								<gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> seems to be restricting itself
							to chasing Japanese fishing boats instead of capturing them. The move to
							arrange a Shiina visit will further this moderation as the Koreans know
							that seizures will make it hard for Shiina to come to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Our efforts to bring about a greater degree of economic exchange between
							Korea and Japan have borne fruit slowly. The extended argument over the
							$20 million loan is nearing an end. The Koreans are just about to accept
							the loan, although after considerable haggling. Similarly, protracted
							discussions over the terms of commercial credits for the PVC and cement
							plants may be reaching an end. The bickering that went on has detracted
							from what otherwise could have been useful contributions to Korean
							realization of the economic benefits of normalization. Efforts at
							expansion of Korean exports to Japan before normalization continue to
							yield results and are worth pursuing but not much significance has been
							attached to them thus far by either side, even though Korean's trade
							deficit with Japan this year is likely to be substantially smaller than
							in 1963.</p>
                        <p>The change in Soviet leadership, the British election results, and even
							more importantly the Chinese Communist nuclear explosion, have all had
							an interesting and probably significant effect on Korean attitudes in
							respect to normalization or relations with Japan. These events have
							caused Koreans to ponder the need for closer relations with Japan in a
							changing world, and to realize that isolation is not in their interest.
							The Foreign Minister has told me he intends to take advantage of this
							fortuitous development. To some extent the press is already reflecting
							the idea and calling for pursuit of national interest in the broadest
							possible terms. The government has used the occasion to repeat its plea
							for a non-partisan approach to foreign policy, especially in relation to
							Japan.</p>
                        <p>Although non-partisanship sounds sensible and we expect some effort in
							this direction, I do not see enough signs of that “sincerity” of which
							Koreans frequently speak. The Foreign Minister looks at non-partisanship
							more as a gambit than a serious course of action. The more adamant
							individuals on the opposition side may give lip-service to the concept
							but deny the principle in practice. Nevertheless, I believe efforts to
							create a “national” rather than a “partisan” attitude are likely to
							continue.</p>
                        <p>All of the elements involved in achieving a settlement will be coming
							into play over the next few months. Diplomacy will seek to express
							itself in negotiation, public support will be solicited, and political
							maneuvering will take place. President Pak and the Foreign Minister have
							sufficient determination to lead to a serious effort. The government's
							internal educational campaign is still in low gear but the Foreign <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0806"/>Minister claims it will gather
							speed once a Shiina visit is in the offing and the resumption of
							negotiations approaches.</p>
                        <p>Over the past two weeks the government has been publicly insisting on its
							intention to go ahead with negotiations. Perhaps this has been a way of
							testing the water. So far the reaction has not been adverse. Moreover,
							through a series of meetings within the government and between the
							government and the Democratic-Republican Party preparations for
							resumption of negotiations have been stepped up. There is also talk of
							meeting with the opposition. Good press coverage of these activities has
							added to the air of seriousness surrounding the government's efforts to
							get on with negotiations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>Many uncertainties remain and I do not wish to exhibit unwarranted
							confidence. But I do believe that there has been a measure of
							improvement in the atmosphere. We have at least reached the stage where
							the government feels that the resumption of negotiations in itself is
							not likely to cause a sharp reaction in Korea. We therefore approach the
							next crucial round in the settlement process with just a bit more
							hopefulness than we had a month or two ago.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>Recent developments in the negotiations between Japan and Korea seem to
							have been marked by a more positive approach by the Korean side and by a
							“Missouri-like show me” attitude on the Japanese side, which has been
							complicated by the uncertainties attending the resignation of Prime
							Minister Ikeda.</p>
                        <p>The new Korean Ambassador has given the impression that the Koreans are
							now prepared not only to start negotiations but to bring them to a
							successful conclusion in the near future. To this end, he said <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0807"/>he would settle the outstanding
							problems concerning the $20 million loan and the loans for the cement
							and the PVC plants and that he is ready to proceed with similar speed
							and determination to settle the other issues between Japan and
							Korea.</p>
                        <p>On the Japanese side, there appears to be something of the feeling that
							they are now hearing again the old record which they have heard many
							times over the past ten or twelve years. Asian Bureau Director Ushiroku
							has taken pains to point out to us that there are many problems which
							remain to be solved and that each of these many problems will require
							difficult negotiation.</p>
                        <p>An important reason for this Japanese feeling is their inability to
							predict with much assurance that an agreement arrived at in Tokyo will
							be supported by enough political opinion in Korea to permit the Korean
							government to remain in power. For that reason, there is a fear that any
							concessions the Japanese may make at the bargaining table now will be
							ineffective in producing normal relations with Korea; thus, further
							Japanese concessions might become necessary in the new negotiations
							which would later be required.</p>
                        <p>There is also a fear that the Koreans will use the weakness of their
							government to extract further concessions from Japan; the Japanese
							expect the Koreans will argue that unless Japan makes concessions, the
							Korean government may fall and normalization will not be achieved.</p>
                        <p>There is also some fear that the United States will use these same
							arguments to pressure the Japanese into meeting the Korean demands.
							There was something of this in the reaction of the Foreign Minister to
							the recent visits by Bob Barnett and yourself.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese press continues to regard normalization with Korea as a
							natural development. It has reported and condemned recent seizures of
							Japanese ships but there has been no call by the responsible press for
							refusing to carry on the normalization negotiations. The press has
							generally followed the guidance of the Foreign Minister, welcoming the
							new Ambassador but playing down the possibilities of an early
							settlement.</p>
                        <p>The resignation of Prime Minister Ikeda and the political negotiations
							attendant upon the selection of a new Prime Minister will make it
							difficult, if not impossible, for Foreign Minister Shiina to visit Korea
							in the immediate future. However, as soon as the new Administration is
							installed, the Japanese should be able to proceed with negotiations.
							Japanese policy and positions are already well established and the
							Japanese negotiators can start their work without further guidance.
							Normalization with Korea has been established LDP policy for many years
							and we doubt that any new government will alter this policy
							substantially.</p>

                        <p>407. The Administration attaches high priority to early <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japan settlement and is actively
							considering whether or not the U.S. should take more positive role, even
							extending to mediation, in achieving one. Moreover, Japan's growing
							interest in normalization <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0809"/>of
							relations with Chicoms increases pressure on us to get <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japan settlement first.</p>
                        <p>Following paras intended to elicit from you contributions to current
								<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> exploration of possible
							initiatives. We are prepared consider seriously pressures, if likely to
							be productive, both on Seoul where we have direct leverage and on Tokyo
							where we can appeal to Japan's great capabilities and the
							responsibilities which should go with them.</p>
                        <p>1. One possible move would be to tell the <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> quietly that we are supporting <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces for use against Communists and not as means for
							pursuing controversy with another U.S. ally—at very time when U.S. and
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> should both be trying to engage
							this other ally in providing support to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> development. Future <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
							appropriations for Korea, already under severe Congressional
							examination, could be affected by Korea's use of its security and
							defense equipment in ways to inflame relations with Japan.</p>
                        <p>2. Another possibility is to hinge a substantial portion of further
								<gloss target="#t_DL1">DL</gloss> to an <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japan settlement in some credible manner. We could say
							to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s that U.S. development aid not
							really effective until it can be augmented by complementing aid from
							other countries, particularly Japan. It is up to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s themselves to prove to us development intentions
							serious by gaining access to Japanese aid. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s would be far wiser to normalize now, when major U.S.
							presence still available as counterweight to any Japanese ambitions,
							than to risk loss of U.S. interest which would leave <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> eventually much more dependent on
							Japanese.</p>
                        <p>3. General feeling here is that we must achieve normalization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japan relations before prospective
							normalization of Japan/Chicom relations introduces major new
							uncertainty. Would there be any mileage in delicately intimating to
								<gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> that U.S., which is in effect
							carrying whole burden of support of Korean buffer-zone for Japan, would
							find it most difficult to be confronted with steps toward normalization
							of relations with Chicoms prior to normalization with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>? This would simply not be understood by
							U.S. Govt and public, which would see Japan as failing to live up to its
							strategic responsibilities in Northeast Asia. We would naturally wish
							avoid implying to Japanese that, once <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japan settlement achieved, we would have no further
							objection to any Japanese moves toward Peiping. However, we estimate
							that some such moves are in the offing anyway, and that inserting <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>/Japan settlement as condition precedent
							might actually serve to delay rather than accelerate them. Similarly,
							would it be useful to impress on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
							wisdom of normalization relations with Japan before Japan moves closer
							to Communist China (and by inference to North Korea)?</p>
                        <p>Above are at present merely ideas on which we invite Embassy
								comments.<note n="2" xml:id="d352fn2">In their replies Brown and
								Reischauer agreed that the climate for reaching a settlement was
								currently positive, but that the United States must continue to
								exert its influence effectively so that negotiations could be
								brought to a successful conclusion. Brown believed “new initiatives
								and possibly harsher intervention” were not yet required, whereas
								Reischauer advocated exerting pressure on Japan through strong and
								unequivocal U.S. support for Korea, especially in light of potential
								domestic and political turmoil in Korea that could accompany
								normalization with Japan. (Telegram 461 from Seoul, November 16, and
								telegram 1761 from Tokyo, November 17; both ibid.)</note> We would

								did not review the Korea-Japan problem. (Telegram Secto 17 from New

								again on December 5 and briefly discussed Japan-Korea normalization,
								among other topics. Shiina told <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that conditions in Korea and Japan “had
								improved considerably and were now conducive to a successful
								conclusion of negotiations” between two countries. He expected a
								settlement could be reached in 1965. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> offered U.S. assistance to achieve that

                        </p>
                        <p>2. On Korea he felt present was best opportunity to settle problem and
							showed strong determination to push ahead toward early normalization. He
							agreed with me that unless settlement achieved soon it might become
							progressively more difficult and also agreed that this was time for
							Japan to show maximum magnanimity. He said, however, that in talking
							with Koreans he had found unexpected difficulties. Deep fears of
							Japanese economic domination sometimes made magnanimous gestures suspect
							in Korean eyes, and since many Koreans are more interested in profit to
							themselves or their groups than in benefit to Korea, Japanese economic
							concessions became embroiled in domestic Korean politics (as they also
							sometimes did in Japanese politics for analogous reasons). Hence even
							acts of generosity required greatest caution or they might worsen rather
							than help situation. On Japanese side, fishing interests of west Japan
							were thoroughly aroused over threats to their traditional livelihood and
							created difficult political situation here.</p>
                        <p>3. I pointed out that most helpful act of magnanimity toward Korea would
							be some sort of apology to Koreans for colonial past. Shiina replied
							that any attempt along these lines would probably either arouse strong
							adverse reaction in Japan or else prove worse than unsatisfactory to
							Koreans. His private secretary who was also there interposed that
							proposed Shiina visit to Korea came as close to expression of apology as
							was feasible. I agreed that apology would be extremely delicate
							operation, but wondered if some forward-looking statement about turning
							backs on past unhappy history and moving to new period of friendly
							cooperation might not help assuage Korean feelings without irritating
							Japanese public. It might be tied to fact that 1965 is under same sign
							of sixty year cycle as 1905 when Japanese protectorate established and
							therefore in East Asian thinking is time for a new departure. (Point was
							made to me by Amb Kim who says Koreans refer to establishment of
							Japanese protectorate by cyclical name of <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0811"/>year, thus emphasizing relationship of 1965 and 1905.)
							Shiina seemed unconvinced.<note n="3" xml:id="d353fn3">In telegram 1817,

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I believe visit by President Pak to US would be useful generally in
							respect overall US–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations and
							more specifically in connection <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan normalization. Over past few weeks we have been
							reminded by Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Presidential Secretary,
							Yi Hu-rak of Pak's desire make official visit. Yi Hu-rak said President
							definitely desires visit in spring but I have not discussed question
							with President.</p>
                        <p>2. Timing of visit should be related to progress <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan normalization. If settlement with Japan reached
							before March, Pak visit in March or April could help gain public
							acceptance normalization and give Pak extra boost in overcoming this
							difficult problem. If settlement not reached by then because of
							continuing popular opposition at home, Pak visit could be used to
							improve prospects early normalization. We will be better able to judge
							these possibilities after negotiations have <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0812"/>been resumed. Whenever it occurs visit would be
							construed in Korea as US support for Pak and his policies.</p>
                        <p>3. Timing also related to usually unsettled political climate
							characteristic of springtime in recent years. With <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan normalization as focal point, and
							continuing political animosity to govt on part some opposition party
							elements, coming spring quite likely to be time of internal tension.
							Other factors at work include: emerging unification question, economic
							stresses, student activism, and possible return Kim Chong-pil.
							Strengthening Pak's position at such time would probably be desirable in
							interest overall stability and continuity orderly political developments
							of constitutional government.</p>
                        <p>4. Foreign Minister at one point suggested that because of expected
							tensions in spring he believes Pak should remain in Korea at that time
							and visit US later in year. Yi Hu-rak, on other hand, has remarked that
							visit in spring would distract public attention from other difficulties
							facing govt and would increase ability govt overcome opposition to its
							policies and quiet tensions.</p>
                        <p>5. I believe we can leave question of timing as related to internal
							tensions to Pak's judgement. My own judgement now would be to favor
							visit in spring for reason cited above but I would want to discuss
							timing personally with Pak. If Dept favors visit I suggest that I be
							authorized to tell Pak US would welcome visit and then explore various
							possibilities with him. In this connection it would be helpful if Dept

							We are seriously concerned about confusion and indecision within Korean

                        <p>Prime Minister Sato turned to Japan-Korea relations.<note n="2" xml:id="d356fn2">Sato made an official visit to Washington on
								January 12–13.</note> He said that his Government found the domestic
							political situation in the Republic of Korea hard to understand.
							Apparently both the President and Prime Minister of the Republic of
							Korea sincerely want to achieve an early settlement with Japan. He did
							not see any clear prospect for such a settlement, but his Government
							would do everything it could to promote normalization of relations. He
							felt strongly that a settlement with Korea could not be delayed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that a
							Japan-Korea settlement is very important. We have regretted the delays
							in the settlement, which have been costly to all of us. As we look back
							and realize the benefits both countries have lost this past three years,
							we can see how costly the <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0815"/>delay
							has been. We have felt that both sides desire a settlement, but that the
							problem is the terms. This problem has been vexing. The Koreans very
							earnestly desire a settlement of their differences with Japan. One has
							only to recall some of the demonstrations which have taken place to see
							that a domestic problem exists, however. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he hoped very much that an
							agreement could be worked out through diligence and patience. Such a
							settlement would be a stimulus to the Free World position in the Western
							Pacific; it would be a great achievement if Japan and Korea could put
							their relations on a long-term, stable basis.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Sato said that he would be discussing this problem with
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> and would
							see if a way could be found to move ahead with a settlement. It would be
							undesirable in both Japan and Korea for the U.S. to appear to intervene
							in the negotiations, and for that reason the Japanese side had asked for
							the deletion of the Japan-Korea paragraph from the Joint
								Communique.<note n="3" xml:id="d356fn3">The text of the <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>-Sato communique of January
								13 is in American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965, pp.
								769–771.</note> The Secretary agreed. The Prime Minister said that
							his Government wants the abolition of the “Rhee Line,” but the Korean
							Government finds it difficult to get public acceptance for this idea
							within Korea. He suggested that Japan could accept a de facto abolition
							of the “Rhee Line,” without a formal approach to the problem in written
							form, if the Treaty—if ratified—superseded domestic legislation in
							Korea; but this was a difficult point to iron out. He said another
							outstanding minor problem is Takeshima (Dokto).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he thought that
							it might be possible to work out some kind of cooperation on the “Rhee
							Line.” Similar problems have been worked out in the past. Perhaps the
							Rhee Line could be left to wither away and disappear ultimately through
							irrelevance in terms of the overall improvement in Japan-Korea
							relations. An example of this is the national frontier between
							Luxembourg and Belgium.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of greetings, the Secretary said that he had been
							looking forward to a discussion of a number of problems with Foreign

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Korea-Japan Settlement</p>
                        <p>The Secretary congratulated Foreign Minister Lee on the progress of the
							discussions with Japan. Initialling of the Basic Relations Treaty had
							been a very important step. He hoped that Korea and Japan were close to
							a final settlement. The U.S. had been very strongly interested in a
							settlement for some years. Delay itself was costly.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister Lee said that recently there had been very satisfactory
							developments, though the US might be of assistance in producing a
							satisfactory and speedy result. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> had been
							of great assistance during his visits to Korea and Japan last fall.
							Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName> had also been
							doing very effective work behind the scenes. The Basic Relations Treaty
							concluded a few weeks ago dealt with the most fundamental and important
							issues, which were now settled. A few minor issues, such as fisheries,
							the status of Korean residents in Japan, and economic cooperation and
							trade relations still remained. The Korean Government was negotiating
							with Japan for a quick settlement of all these issues.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he planned to stop in Tokyo for three days
							on his way back to Korea, when he would try to bring an end to the
							long-drawn-out negotiations and sign an agreement. He had told this to
							Prime Minister Sato and Foreign Minister Shiina. (The <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0818"/>Foreign Minister interjected that Prime
							Minister <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> had asked him to
							convey his personal greetings to the Secretary.) Sato had said that
							Korea should make concessions on the fisheries question. The Foreign
							Minister said that he had told Sato that fisheries were a little matter
							and that making small concessions in such a little matter should present
							little difficulty for Japan. In Korea, however, the issue meant a lot,
							emotionally and politically. It was Japan's fault that this was so,
							because of its actions of the past half century. The Foreign Minister
							said he told Sato that Korea needs not just normal relations with Japan
							but good relations. Conclusion of the negotiations was very important,
							but it was even more important that the treaty be accepted by the Korean
							people. Korea did not want a treaty that caused instability and which
							might shake the foundations of the Park Government. The Korean people
							were very emotional on the subject of Japan; Japan should take this fact
							into account.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that Foreign Minister Shiina had said that
							maybe it was still too early for a settlement. Foreign Minister Lee said
							he had replied that Korea and Japan had been talking for the past 14
							years and had no more to say. If Japan was prepared to proceed in a
							spirit of concessions the agreement could be concluded in two hours and
							signed in half a minute. Shiina nevertheless continued to express doubt
							that a settlement could be achieved so soon.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked when Foreign Minister Lee planned to return to Tokyo.
							The Foreign Minister replied that he would arrive there March 23. He had
							told Sato and Shiina that they should bring a pistol and kill him if a
							settlement were not achieved—his loss of face would be so great he could
							not return to Korea. The Secretary demurred, saying that this would set
							a dangerous precedent among Foreign Ministers. The Foreign Minister said
							he was sure the Japanese would try very hard to reach agreement. Now was
							the best time, the golden opportunity.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that strong propaganda had been coming out of
							Pyongyang and Peiping against a settlement. He asked what influence this
							propaganda had in the Republic of Korea. The Foreign Minister replied
							that it had none. He said that when Shiina was recently in Korea there
							were no big demonstrations but that when he (Lee) was recently in Japan
							there had been demonstrations wherever he went. The demonstrations in
							Japan were by Communists, directed from Peiping. In Korea, on the other
							hand, the demonstrations were of a nationalistic nature growing out of
							Korea's past humiliating experience with Japan. The two should not be
							confused. The opportune time for a settlement had arrived in Korea. The
							Park regime is very stable and in a good position, and the people are
							enlightened on the question of a settlement with Japan, understanding
							the necessity for good relations with Japan. They appreciate the
							economic benefits which such a settlement <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0819"/>would bring Korea. The atmosphere is good and it is
							most important that the existing momentum not be lost.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Foreign Minister Lee's initialling of the
							Basic Relations Treaty had caused an adverse reaction in Korea. The
							Foreign Minister said that it had not, because the treaty was acceptable
							to the Korean public. He said that the Korean people were poor but well
							educated; they were enlightened enough to have sound judgment on certain
								things.<note n="2" xml:id="d358fn2">The Embassy had reported,
								however, that “opposition parties [were] pursuing relentlessly
								within and without National Assembly a series of actions designed to
								bring about cessation ROK-Japan negotiations.” (Telegram 855 from
								Seoul, March 10; ibid., <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister went on to say that a couple of words in Foreign
							Minister Shiina's arrival statement had helped a good deal. Shiina had
							said that he was sorry for the past and looked to a new and different
							future. Shiina was the first Japanese ever to say that, and his
							statement had had a most helpful effect. It was most important that
							solutions of remaining issues be acceptable to the Korean people;
							otherwise the whole purpose of the settlement would be defeated. Korea
							did not ask that the U.S. apply pressure to Japan—he knew that we could
							not do that—but he did hope that we would talk frankly with the
							Japanese. This would be much appreciated by the Korean Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would take note of the Foreign Minister's
							comments. He observed that we had been talking to the Japanese
							concerning a settlement during the four years that he had been
							Secretary, and before that time.</p>

                        <p>2. Meanwhile govt is conducting full campaign to explain agreement to
							public and counter opposition and student moves.<note n="4" xml:id="d360fn4">While the Korean Government and <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> politicians attempted to win

                        <p>3. Pak visit to Washington is important element in govt plans. In present
							schedule it is strategically placed between first shock of opposition
							moves now underway and final struggle over ratification. Barring
							unexpectedly violent demonstrations in next few weeks ratification
							period will be most critical period.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_ROKG1">ROKG</gloss> is counting on US political,
							military and economic assurances at time of visit to provide boost to

							have received from Blue House neither Pak nor his govt wish such a
							package to be presented <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0821"/>prior
							to visit. I am convinced that if we were to approach Pak with draft
							letter proposed at this time he would ask matter be deferred until his
							visit. This would be especially true if, as is likely, visit were to
							take place only a week or so after signature of agreement with
							Japan.</p>
                        <p>5. I believe surfacing US commitments by letter before Pak visit would
							dissipate their impact, which is sure to be greatest if it comes at time
							when public opinion in Korea is sharply focused on Pak and relationships
							between Korea and US. Moreover, prior surfacing would certainly lead to
							further bargaining in connection with visit. Given Korean psychology and
							pervasive relationship between US and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that has been built up over the years there is no
							avoiding association of a package with visit itself.</p>
                        <p>5. Therefore, I continue to believe material content draft letter should
							be reserved for joint communique or other appropriate occasion connected
							with visit. I would however see value in simple letter of congratulation
							at time of signature as further evidence of US interest and support. For
							this purpose paras one, two, first sentence para three, penultimate para
							on page three, draft letter dated March 31, ending with para
							anticipating pleasure of meeting in Washington would be very
							appropriate. Similar message to Prime Minister Sato might well be felt
							necessary.</p>
                        <p>7. Form of expressions of assurances which we are prepared to give is
							almost as important as their substance and for maximum impact should be
							tailored so far as possible to Korean reader. With this in mind I will
							within few days submit recommendations as to how substantive matters
							contained in draft letter of March 31 and one or two other points I have
							to suggest might best be expressed in a joint communique. If it is
							desired to restrict joint communique to general statement, the
							commitments could alternatively be given at time of visit in some other
							appropriate form, e.g. an accompanying letter or memorandum.</p>

							had written a personal letter to Ambassador Kim, instructing him to
							conclude the agreement by June 15 and giving him full authority to do
							so. He was assured by Ambassador Kim that agreement could be reached in
							time for every issue, except that of Tokto.<note n="4" xml:id="d364fn4">The remaining issues were the length of time a fisheries agreement
								would remain in effect and the procedures to settle disputes, claims
								issues involving property rights and other legal issues, and the
								status of Koreans in Japan, as well as the issue of Tokto/Takeshima.
								(National Archives and Records Administration, RG 59, Central Files
								1964–66, <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> JAPAN–KOR <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note> This had emerged as the sole
							remaining major obstacle to an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese were insisting that agreement on Tokto should be
							specifically mentioned in the agreement. This the Koreans could not
							possibly accept. It would present an almost insuperable obstacle to
							ratification of the agreement by the Assembly and its acceptance by
							Korean public opinion. They realize that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName> had told the Diet several times that settlement of
							the Tokto issue would be included in <pb n="794" xml:id="pg_794" facs="0826"/>the agreement with Korea and therefore that he had a
							political problem, but this was nothing compared to the problem which
							would be presented in Korea were Tokto to be mentioned in the
							agreement.</p>
                        <p>To meet the Japanese problem, the Koreans were ready to include a
							paragraph at the end of the agreement which would say that any remaining
							issues unsolved by the agreement would be the subject of subsequent
							consultation. If the Japanese desire, as they had indicated that they
							did, that the matter be the subject of discussions with a third party as
							well as the two principals, the Koreans were ready to make provision for
							third party participation in the discussion of “remaining issues”.</p>
                        <p>The Japanese could say that Tokto was such an issue and that discussion
							about it was contemplated by the agreement. The Koreans could say that
							Tokto was not covered by the agreement. Both would be technically
							correct. This should help the Japanese was as far as the Koreans could
							go [sic]. The President stated flatly more than once that there was no
							give in this position.</p>
                        <p>I suggested it might be useful to have a further meeting between Foreign
							Ministers Shiina and Yi Tong-won. The President said that if the
							Japanese persisted in their position on Tokto there was no point in a
							Foreign Minister's meeting and that if they would accept the Korean
							proposal on Tokto there was no need for such a meeting, since Ambassador
							Kim had full authority to settle all the issues.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that our reports had indicated that there were a number of
							smaller issues which, though causing difficulties for the technicians,
							might very easily be settled at the political level. The President was
							not receptive to the idea of a further Foreign Minister's meeting. The
							President asked the United States to intercede with the Japanese on the
							Tokto issue. I said that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REO1">Reischauer</persName> had mentioned it to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SE1">Sato</persName>, but had found him quite
							sticky.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is quite clear that the Korean
							position against any mention of Tokto in the agreement with Japan is
							adamant. I believe that the government's appraisal of the adverse effect
							which any mention of this ill-fated subject would have on the prospect
							for ratification and especially upon the principle of mobilization of
							indispensable support from the members of the <gloss target="#t_DRP1">DRP</gloss> is probably accurate.</p>
                        <p>Although Yi Tong-won told me yesterday he is quite prepared to meet again
							with Shiina if it would be helpful, I think it unlikely that President
							Pak would wish him to go to Tokyo unless it is quite sure that the
							Japanese will give on the Tokto issue. He might then be willing to have
							him go and his presence might be really helpful in buttoning up a number
							of lesser issues.</p>

                        <p>Initially violent student demonstrations accompanied the acceptance of

							close until August 20. Some colleges, universities, and high schools

							used tear gas against them. (Telegram 1368, June 22, and telegram 8,

							the forceful suppression of the demonstrations, the students did not

                        <p>In Japan political opposition to the treaty arose within the Socialist

                        <p>On August 12, 1965, U.S. Government officials responsible for East Asian
							Affairs met to discuss the problem of opposition in the Republic of
							Korea National Assembly to ratification of a normalization treaty
							between Japan and Korea. The officials agreed that “the primary source
							of opposition to ratification of the normalization treaty with Japan
							lies in the 65 seats held by the People's Party in the 175 delegate
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> National Assembly.” They also
							noted that this opposition “compares with the pro-government Democratic
							Republican Party's total of 110 seats.” The officials identified the
							need to prevent the “People's Party from paralyzing National Assembly
							procedures and from increasing opposition sentiment in the population.”
							The People's Party was divided roughly into those moderately opposed to
							the treaty and hard-liners unalterably opposed to the treaty. The
							officials agreed that the principal hazard to treaty ratification was
							resignation in bloc of the People's Party members from the National
							Assembly, that would force an election prior to Assembly consideration.
							The officials then discussed in detail actions that the United States
							was taking and could take “to diminish the number of fanatics and to
							dampen the opposition of the moderates.” (Memorandum from Stuart to

                            <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan Normalization</p>
                        <p>1. The Secretary said he had great personal respect for the role played
							by the Foreign Minister in the negotiations for normalization of
							relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan. The Foreign Minister
							had displayed a high degree of wisdom and courage. The Secretary said he
							understood that the ratification instruments would soon be exchanged. He
							asked if the Minister saw any obstacles to good relations between the
							two governments arising in the near future.</p>
                        <p>2. The Minister replied that the instruments of ratification were
							scheduled to be exchanged on December 22 in Seoul. He foresaw no real
							problems arising. As he had mentioned to Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
							that morning,<note n="2" xml:id="d367fn2">A memorandum of their
								conversation is ibid.</note> the negotiations were now over and the
							Korean people were trying to forget the sad memories of the past.
							Everything now depends on the sincerity and spirit of cooperation of
							each side. He said good relations with Japan were important to Korea but
							the Korean people are very sensitive and there would be trouble if the
							Japanese were too selfish.</p>
                        <p>3. The Secretary said that in view of the history of the last 60 years
							and the proximity of Korea, a small country, to Japan, a large country,
							the sensitivity of the Korean people is understandable. He pointed out
							that the United States has encountered similar feelings from time to
							time on the part of the Canadians and Mexicans. However, today's Japan
							is not the same Japan as that with which the Korean people had <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0830"/>been acquainted prior to 1945.
							Great changes have taken place in Japan since then.</p>
                        <p>4. The Minister replied that he agreed and that his government, as well
							as Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BWG1">Brown</persName>, has made great efforts to
							convince the Korean people of this truth. However, it is now up to Japan
							to demonstrate sincerity in its dealings with Korea.</p>
                        <p>5. The Secretary asked whether the Minister was suggesting that Japan
							adopt a “low posture” toward the Republic of Korea. The Minister replied
							that his government only wished the Japanese to adopt a “normal
							posture.” The Secretary said the United States would help, when
							appropriate.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Korean Proposal for Tripartite Consultations</p>
                        <p>6. The Foreign Minister stated that the United States is the big brother
							of the Republic of Korea and of Japan. The two younger brothers have
							quarreled with each other in the past. It might be useful if the elder
							brother would now bring the younger brothers into a family atmosphere to
							talk over family matters. He said he was not asking for a commitment or
							for institutionalized meetings. He said that his government is confident
							that U.S. policy toward the Republic of Korea will not change as a
							result of normalization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japan
							relations.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary replied that in view of the great span of Korean and
							Japanese culture and history, the Minister was extremely flattering to
							speak of the United States as an elder brother. He said the Minister was
							quite right in assuming that there would be no change in U.S. policy.
							The United States has an unlimited commitment in Korea. If the United
							States Government were to relinquish any of its responsibilities in
							Korea, they would be turned over to the Republic of Korea and to no one
							else.</p>
                        <p>8. The Secretary went on to say that the effect of World War II on the
							Japanese had been radically different than its effect on the Koreans.
							The Japanese Government had renounced the use of force and had
							prohibited the establishment of armed forces. It was politically
							impossible for the Japanese Government to emulate the example set by the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government in Viet-Nam. Japan
							was only gradually assuming the responsibilities appropriate to a
							country of its size and strength. The United States is encouraging it to
							do so, but the process will take a little time.</p>
                        <p>9. The Minister recalled that he personally had told Japanese Prime
							Minister Sato that it is time for Japan to share some of the
							responsibilities of the United States in Asia. Sato had agreed but had
							said that there are legal and domestic difficulties in the way. The
							Secretary remarked that we have been encouraged by recent Japanese
							actions such as the decision to participate in the Asian Development
							Bank.</p>
                        <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0831"/>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Foreign Ministers Conference</p>
                        <p>10. The Foreign Minister recalled that a year ago he had invited the
							Foreign Ministers of 10 Asian nations to attend a Foreign Ministers
							Conference in Seoul. Most replies had been favorable but the Japanese
							had adopted a negative attitude toward the proposal. He believed,
							however, that the Japanese attitude was being modified. Ambassador Kim
							Tong-cho had recently reported from Tokyo that the Japanese are now
							indicating an interest in participating in the conference. He said in
							his view the conference should not discuss specific problems. His idea
							in proposing the conference was to have Asian Foreign Ministers sit down
							together and hold a general discussion of Asian affairs and seek methods
							of cooperation.</p>
                        <p>11. The Secretary asked if the Minister had any date in mind for
							convening the conference. The Minister replied that he was going to be
							talking with Japanese Prime Minister Sato and Foreign Minister Shiina in
							Tokyo on his way back to Seoul. He intended to consult with them
							concerning a specific date and obtain their views regarding what type of
							conference should be held. He believed their desires should be carefully
							considered.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary observed that some subjects can be discussed more
							effectively if the United States is not present. The Minister replied
							that his government would remain highly dependent on continued U.S.
							support to make the conference successful.</p>

                        <p>1. Foreign Minister Shiina brought up a problem concerning Korea. He said
							that Japan's relations with the Republic of Korea were going well except
							for one headache. This was the problem of the export of plants to North
							Korea and the entry of North Koreans into Japan in connection therewith.
							To accomplish the export of plants to North Korea it was absolutely
							necessary for technicians to come to Japan and carry out inspections.
							This was the usual business practice. The Japanese Government had
							delayed this matter for over three years on the grounds that the trea-
							ties to normalize relations with the Republic of Korea were in process.
							Now that the normalization had been accomplished this was no longer a
							possible out and the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> had to do
							something. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, however, said that
								Japanese-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations would suffer
							fundamentally if Japan admitted North Koreans to this country and
							carried out the plant exports. Mr. Shiina thought, however, that
							relations with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had grown roots
							to the extent that no catastrophe would result from Japan's actions, but
							he had to admit there would be some difficulty.</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. Shiina said he did not want to involve the Secretary in this
							matter or ask him to bring it up in Korea. If the Koreans brought this
							problem up with the Secretary, however, he hoped the Secretary would not
							indicate that he had discussed it with the Japanese. The problem
							concerned not only the admission of North Koreans to Japan but financing
							of the exports by private means. There was no intent to use Japanese
							Export-Import Bank financing. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> action in this case would not set a precedent and
							future similar matters would be handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether
							Japan-North Korean trade was important. Mr. Shiina replied that the
							trade itself was not important but it appeared to Japan that it was only
							natural for such deals to be approved and the <gloss target="#t_GOJ1">GOJ</gloss> could not delay further since the matter had been
							postponed already for three years.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that he had
							infinite confidence in the ability of foreign office officials to delay
							matters!</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. Shiina said that even the governing Liberal Democratic Party
							favored admitting the North Korean technicians and it would be difficult
							for the government to hold the line any longer.</p>

                        <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that this
							was surely a mosquito bite from the overall point of view of foreign
							trade but it should be remembered that malaria can develop from a
							mosquito bite. He thought Japan's relations with South Korea were of far
							greater magnitude and importance than those with North Korea.</p>

                        <p>A–1065. Subject: Japanese-Korean Relations in the Year Since
							Normalization</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Introduction and Summary</p>
                        <p>1. The first anniversary of the ratification of the treaty and agreements
							which normalized relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea came
							on December 18, 1966. The anniversary occasioned a flurry of background
							articles in the Japanese press, but there were no major public
							celebrations in Tokyo (the Korean Embassy selected last June 22, the
							anniversary of the signing of the agreements, as the occasion for an
							enormous party to which the conservative establishment of Japan came in
							their hundreds), and the day was a quiet reflection of the
							matter-of-fact acceptance by most Japanese of the controversial
							settlement with their closest neighbor.</p>
                        <p>2. The Embassy's overall impression is that, in the year since the
							restoration of formal diplomatic relations, there has been a significant
							broadening and deepening of private and unofficial contact and
							understanding between the two countries, although the Korean minority in
							Japan remains unpopular and the state of Japanese media and scholarly
							coverage and research of Korean affairs can only charitably be termed
							modest in comparison with Japanese interests there. On the official
							side, not only has a great deal been done to clean up the detailed
							problems surrounding implementation of the Treaty settlement, but
							problems which have arisen de novo during the year have for the most <pb n="802" xml:id="pg_802" facs="0834"/>part been solved—although not,
							of course, without stresses and strains. Basic differences remain
							between the two countries in terms of their disparate levels of economic
							development and the gulf in their attitudes toward Communism (or, more
							precisely, the gulf in the range of attitudes and actions required of
							the two governments by their publics' differing estimates of the threat
							which Communist power poses to their national interests). The huge trade
							gap (in Japan's favor) remains a continuing problem, and Korea's
							intensified efforts during the past year to obtain commitments from
							Japan for larger imports of specified commodities (e.g., laver,
							cuttlefish) and for other concessionary trade treatment were only
							moderately successful. There are indications, however, that the two
							governments have evolved working relationships which not only recognize
							these differences realistically, but may even surmount them in favor of
							increased cooperation in multilateral forums for Asian economic
							development and in the United Nations vis-a-vis preservation of the
								<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>'s special position there.<note n="2" xml:id="d369fn2">Department of State intelligence analysts
								shared the Embassy's favorable impression of Korea-Japan relations,
								concluding that the two governments have created a “relatively
								amicable relationship” since normalizing relations. (Intelligence
								Note 1022, December 22; ibid.)</note>
