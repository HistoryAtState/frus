                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador called after having been absent many weeks on
                            account of an attack of pneumonia. He inquired first whether the United
                            States Government was still inclined to sign the Argentine Peace Pact,
                            to which I replied in the affirmative but added that I had informed Dr.
                            Saavedra Lamas at Montevideo that there would be some reservations to
                            the signature of my government. I then stated that since my return from
                            Montevideo I had constantly urged my associates here and the officials
                            at Montevideo to take all possible steps to facilitate the signature of
                            any treaty or convention and their presentation to the ratifying
                            agencies at the capital of each government, including the Senate of the
                            United States. The Ambassador inquired whether my government would be
                            willing to cooperate with his in urging other governments to sign where
                            they had not signed any of these treaties, and also to ratify or adhere
                            where they had not done so. In reply I repeated what I had said to him
                            early in our conversation as to the activities and attitude of the
                            United States Government. I assured him that just as quickly as these
                            various treaties or conventions were properly printed in English and
                            compared with the Spanish and copies of the same suitable for my
                            signature should reach Washington, they would all be signed by myself
                            and other members of the Delegation and promptly transmitted to the
                            Senate for ratification. I finally stated relative to this treaty <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0073"/>situation that no one could be more
                            desirous, and even anxious, than myself to facilitate the signing and
                            the ratification of each of the five treaties or conventions by each of
                            the 21 governments of this Hemisphere, and that I much regretted the
                            misapprehension of Dr. Lamas to the effect that any of us here at
                            Washington were becoming the least bit indifferent towards the foregoing
                            undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Some general reference was made to the bill pending in the Senate to
                            confer authority on the Executive branch to raise or lower tariffs and
                            similar trade barriers. I repeated to the Ambassador that I and my
                            associates from the beginning had been doing everything within our power
                            to aid in securing the passage of this measure. The Ambassador
                            understood that we could not discuss reciprocity bilateral trade
                            agreements until the passage of this act.</p>

                                printed.</note> and 68, April 21, noon. The President has submitted
                            the Anti-War Treaty to the Senate with a request for advice and consent
                            to ratification subject to the following reservation: <quote

                                <p>“In adhering to this Treaty the United States does not thereby

                        <p>It is the Department’s understanding that the limitations to the
                            conciliation procedure specified in Article V are to be regarded as a
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0074"/>part of the treaty, and that
                            reservation as to any one or more of those limitations is not necessary
                            in order that they may be availed of by the contracting parties. We have
                            acted on this understanding in submitting the treaty to the Senate. If
                            the Foreign Office concurs in this construction of the treaty, you may
                            submit a note as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    October 10, 1933, with such reservations as my Government may

                        <p>70. Pertinent contents of Department’s telegram No. 41, April 23, 7 p.m.,
                            excluding first two paragraphs containing President’s reservation,
                            communicated to Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ministry advises orally, to
                            be confirmed in writing, that it concurs in Department’s construction of
                            article V of treaty.</p>
                        <p>Ministry stresses the five reservations in article V and earnestly
                            requests that the concluding phrase of the note of adhesion, “with such
                            reservations as my Government may deem it indispensable to make”, be
                            altered to read, “with such reservations as the Senate may deem it
                            indispensable to make”.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry is extremely desirous of having our Government adhere at a
                            ceremony on Friday afternoon, the 28th, with other nations. Adhesions
                            then will be made in separate protocols.</p>
                        <p>Ministry further advises that representatives of other signatory powers
                            will speak briefly at ceremony and that Ambassador Espil is being
                            directed to request you to instruct me in the appropriate sense.</p>

                        <p>15. Your 13, June 4, 4 p.m. The Argentine Ambassador recently called at
                            the Department and requested that this Government express its interest
                            in the ratification of the Argentine Anti-War Pact to the Scandinavian
                            countries, with which the Argentine Government has already commenced
                            negotiations in that sense.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was assured of the deep interest of this Government in the
                            ratification of the Pact and the desire to be of assistance toward that
                            end but that we would clearly be in a more favorable position to express
                            such interest after ratification by this Government has taken place. You
                            may inform the Argentine Minister of the foregoing.</p>

                        <p>Prince de Ligne, after the matter had been presented to him, offered to
                            suggest to the Belgian Government that it should bring the subject of
                            the Pan American Agreement before the Assembly of the League of Nations.
                            The object would be to obtain a recommendation from the Assembly that
                            Members of the League of Nations should become parties to the Agreement.
                            In this way, any atmosphere of regionalism which may linger about the
                            Agreement might be dissipated.</p>
                        <p>In the course of discussion, Prince de Ligne expressed a desire for
                            something concrete and definite which he might telegraph to his
                            Government. A draft for a possible Resolution, which the Belgian
                            Government might, should it so desire, introduce into the Assembly of
                            the League of Nations, the 1934 session of which begins on September 10,
                            was accordingly prepared. This draft is as follows: <quote

                            conversations on the subject, I take pleasure in transmitting you
                            information which I have just received by cable from Brussels,
                            concerning the attitude of the Belgian delegate at Geneva on the
                            Montevideo question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Van Langenhove<note n="7" xml:id="d24fn7">Belgian delegate to the
                                League of Nations Assembly and member of the Economic
                                Commission.</note> insisted on the importance of the Pan American
                            Union Convention, the text of which was distributed to all the members
                            present.</p>
                        <p>He asked that the report highly recommend the said Convention, and
                            suggested that it be brought to the special attention of all
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>Our delegate thought it wiser not to adopt the form discussed by us,
                            fearing that it might rouse opposition of different countries,
                            particularly England and Italy. Nevertheless, it seems that the result
                            we were so anxious to secure has been attained by the more general form
                            adopted by our delegate, after having discussed the matter with your <pb

                            as you are aware, in contact with Washington.</p>
                        <p>The telegram further states that Mr. Van Langenhove has been in touch
                            with the various American press agencies.</p>
                        <p>I am so pleased to have been able to be of assistance in the matter.
                            Besides, you know how similar our ideas are, on the subject.</p>

                            <item>I learn that the Belgian representative here is continuing his
                                efforts to call the Pan American Agreement to the favorable
                                attention of League governments during the Assembly. He finds
                                himself, however, greatly handicapped in obtaining support due to
                                present ignorance of European governments regarding the question.
                                This he states is due to the circumstance that officials in the
                                European Foreign Offices knowing little of the character of the Pan
                                American Union gave little attention to the invitation many assuming
                                the Union to be an unofficial organization. The Belgian
                                representative here believed that the invitation would be sent
                                through United States diplomatic channels and it required two
                                telephone calls to Brussels before the document could be
                                located.</item>

                            <item>The Belgian Government is nevertheless intensely interested in
                                pursuing the matter, intends to sign the convention and further is
                                considering immediately calling attention to it through diplomatic
                                channels in all European capitals (please regard the foregoing as
                                confidential).</item>

                            <item>The circumstance that Latin American states here are not showing
                                the interest which might be expected of them is something of an
                                obstacle. Steps are being taken here to correct this situation but
                                Latin American representatives in Geneva do not maintain close
                                contact with their governments and the view is expressed that for
                                the United States to take action if possible in Latin America
                                paralleling possible Belgian action in Europe would be
                                opportune.</item>

                            <item>The attitude of certain European states in so far as I can
                                ascertain it here is: France favorable; Italy while favoring
                                bilateral action would not oppose; Switzerland while expressing
                                openly in the Second Committee that past experience indicates the
                                difficulty of accomplishing anything along the lines of the
                                Agreement is favorable; the Netherlands is willing to support the
                                Belgian position but I do not know of any definite steps being
                                contemplated. The Assembly will probably close the coming
                                week.</item>

                                Information</hi> for July, 1934. It was signed on behalf of the
                            United States September 20. The Pan American Union has issued
                            invitations to all the countries of the world to become parties in
                            accordance with Article 4 of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Belgian Delegation to the Assembly of the League of Nations, now
                            about to enter the third and presumably the final week of its present
                            session, has brought the subject of Resolution 81 before the Second
                            Committee with a view to receiving the endorsement of the Assembly, with
                            consequent impetus to movement to obtain signature of all countries
                            members of the League. In connection with this action the American
                            Consul at Geneva on September 21 telegraphed the Department as follows:
                            “The circumstance that Latin American states here are not showing the
                            interest which might be expected of them is something of an obstacle.
                            Steps are being taken here to correct this situation, but Latin American
                            representatives in Geneva do not maintain close contact with their
                            governments”.</p>
                        <p>I desire you to bring orally and informally the substance of the
                            foregoing (omitting of course the reference to the Latin American
                            representatives in Geneva) to the attention of the government to which
                            you are accredited as a matter in which every member of the Pan American
                            Union would naturally be interested, not as a request for action.<note

                            know, views the general acceptance of the agreement <pb n="19"

                            international commercial policy of all countries. However anxious it may
                            be that the Assembly take favorable action, it is at present deeply
                            concerned lest any false step be taken that might retard the general
                            signature of the agreement. An adverse vote in the Second Committee,
                            based perhaps on a misunderstanding of the question, would be extremely
                            unfortunate.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is for your guidance. It may be necessary for you to take a
                            more positive position to prevent any result that would hamper the

                                xml:id="d43fn14">Not printed.</note> I am now able to submit
                            Uruguayan viewpoint which was explained to me as follows:</p>
                        <p>Uruguay is bound to economically powerful countries by bilateral treaties
                            containing unconditional most favored nation clauses and desires prior

                            above mentioned clause. Uruguay believes that this guarantee will be
                            provided as soon as economically and financially important countries
                            have signed the Agreement now open for signature and text of which is
                            given on pages 28 and 29 of <hi rend="italic">Treaty Information</hi>

                            may assist in inducing economically important nations to sign.</p>

                            refrain from invoking <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0093"/>the

                        <p>In view of the fact that, by virtue of the underlined passage,<note

                            participation in the agreement under consideration, were also bound to
                            refrain from the use of the clause, it is difficult to see why Uruguay
                            should defer signing the agreement until after its signature by the
                            economically powerful countries with which it is bound by bilateral
                            treaties containing the unconditional most-favored-nation clause. It is
                            believed, accordingly, that the position of the Uruguayan Government, as
                            set forth in your telegram, is unnecessary. The Department feels that,
                            on more complete explanation, the Government of Uruguay may be disposed
                            to be numbered among the first of the signers of the Montevideo
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>You are accordingly authorized, on some favorable occasion, to discuss
                            the matter further with the Uruguayan Government. In so doing, you
                            should not fail to express the appreciation of this Government for the
                            cooperation of Uruguay, referred to in your telegram, in the matter of
                            the support of the action of the Belgian Delegation to the Assembly of

                            reference to the Montevideo agreement, was adopted by the Assembly on
                            September 26. Mr. Gilbert adds that in the course of the speech the
                            Argentine Delegate called favorable attention to the Montevideo
                            agreement. There was, however, no further discussion. The Department has
                            not been informed concerning the exact language of the report, but an
                            earlier telegram from Geneva indicates that it calls attention to the
                            relationship between multilateral commercial treaties and the principle
                            of the most-favored-nation clause and mentions, in this connection, the
                            Montevideo agreement and its signature by the United States.</p>

                        <p>172. Because of a recent slight indisposition of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs I was only able yesterday to discuss with him the Department’s
                            circular telegram of September 23, 2 p.m., when I emphasized to him that
                            its subject matter was brought to his attention as a matter of interest
                            to all members of the Pan American Union and not as a request for
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs assured me of his interest but pointed
                            out that with the adjournment of the League Assembly it would appear
                            that nothing could be done at the moment; however, in my presence he
                            directed that instructions be sent to his delegate in Geneva to get into
                            contact with our Consul there with a view to keeping in touch with the
                            subject and for appropriate action at the first available
                            opportunity.</p>

                                <p>“Another discussed by the Committee which it desires to bring to
                                    the notice of the Assembly is the question of the relationship
                                    between multilateral commercial treaties and the policy of the
                                    most-favored-nation clause. Certain delegations expressed the
                                    view that the possibility of reducing obstacles to international
                                    trade by collective action of certain groups of states would be
                                    facilitated by an agreement to refrain from invoking the
                                    obligations of the most-favored-nation clause in respect of
                                    certain multilateral conventions. In this connection the
                                    attention of the Committee was drawn to the Agreement opened for
                                    signature at Washington on July 15, 1934, under the auspices of
                                    the Pan American Union and signed on September 20, 1934, on
                                    behalf of the United States of America.”</p>

                            circular telegram of September 23, 2 p.m., I have the honor to report
                            that I promptly brought the substance thereof to the attention of the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs in the manner desired by the Department,
                            and he told me that he would lose no time in consulting the Government
                            attorney and that, if it was decided to approve the Agreement, he would
                            so notify the Guatemalan representative at the League of Nations, if the
                            Assembly had not previously adjourned.</p>
                        <p>On September 29, Dr. Skinner Klee told me that instructions would be

                            that it would be submitted to the local Legislative Assembly for
                            ratification when it reconvenes in March, 1935. As the League Assembly
                            had then adjourned I did not ask the Foreign Minister if he had sent any
                            communication to Guatemala’s representative in Geneva.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 285 of September 29 with
                            reference to the agreement set forth in Resolution 81 of the Montevideo
                            Conference whereby the contracting parties agree to refrain from
                            invoking the obligations of the most-favored-nation clause in respect to
                            certain multilateral conventions. The Department calls my attention to
                            the language of Article I, which states that the High Contracting
                            Parties, with respect to their relations with one another, will not
                            invoke the obligations of the most-favored-nation clause. It may,
                            therefore, be inferred that Uruguay would not be bound to refrain from
                            invoking the most-favored-nation clause in any treaty unless the other
                            party to the treaty, by virtue of its participation in the agreement
                            under consideration, were so bound to refrain from the use of the
                            clause.</p>
                        <p>A favorable opportunity presented itself yesterday to bring the text of
                            Article I above mentioned to the attention of the Under-Secretary <pb
                                n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0096"/>for Foreign Affairs, who is now
                            at the head of the Ministry of Foreign Relations because of the absence
                            on leave until the end of this month of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
                            I, therefore, availed myself of the authorization to discuss this matter
                            further with the Uruguayan Government, contained in the Department’s
                            instruction under acknowledgment, and expressed at the same time the
                            appreciation of the Government of the United States for the cooperation
                            of Uruguay in instructing its delegate at Geneva to support the action
                            taken by the Belgian Delegation before the Second Committee of the
                            Assembly of the League of Nations in bringing the subject of Resolution
                            81 of the Montevideo Conference before this Committee.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to Dr. Ferreiro, the Under-Secretary, that the language of
                            Article I enabled Uruguay to act with perfect freedom in dealing with
                            other nations with respect to the most-favored-nation clause since the
                            obligation not to invoke this clause was restricted to the contracting
                            parties only in their relations with one another. I pointed out to Dr.
                            Ferreiro, furthermore, that my understanding of the economic policy
                            recently followed by Uruguay would lead one to suppose that the signing
                            of the Montevideo agreement by Uruguay would be in perfect accordance
                            with the position taken by his country in its recent treaty
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Señor Ferreiro appeared to agree completely. He pointed out that Uruguay
                            favored mutual agreement to refrain from invoking the obligations of the
                            most-favored-nation clause. All that his country desired, he said, was
                            to have a free hand in its commercial negotiations with other countries
                            because Uruguay disposed only of meat and some wool as the country’s
                            products.</p>
                        <p>I told him once more that the signing of the Montevideo agreement could
                            not change Uruguay’s position in respect of non-signatory nations or
                            restrict its treaty bargaining power with them. He then said that he
                            would give closer attention to the subject. As stated in my despatch No.
                            762 of September 27, 1934,<note n="19" xml:id="d48fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> Dr. E. E. Buero, the legal adviser on League of
                            Nations affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had been consulted
                            on the subject of Uruguay’s position in the matter. This, Señor Ferreiro
                            said, would have to be done again although he now felt sufficiently
                            familiar with the subject to realize that the signing by Uruguay of the
                            convention was entirely in keeping with the present commercial policy of
                            Uruguay. He stated that he would not be able to give me a definite
                            answer before the return of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was
                            expected back at the Ministry sometime after the 20th of this month. In
                            the meanwhile, he intended going over the matter with Dr. Buero again. I
                            asked him to consider me as prepared to explore with him or with Dr.
                            Buero <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0097"/>any special point or phase
                            of the subject which might arise in the course of his conversations with
                            Dr. Buero. I doubt, however, that the matter can be taken up again
                            before the end of the month as, in addition to the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs’ absence, Dr. Buero is now in Buenos Aires to attend the
                            Eucharistic Congress in that city.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, I made it a point to mention to Under-Secretary Ferreiro
                            that it would be gratifying to count Uruguay among the first of the
                            signers of the Montevideo agreement.</p>

                        <p>75. Minister of Foreign Affairs inquires whether, under article II of
                            agreement relative to noninvoking of most-favored-nation clause, a
                            contracting party may demand fulfillment of that clause from another of
                            the contracting parties or whether article II implies that any
                            contracting party may demand fulfillment of the clause only from a
                            noncontracting party. I am making liberal use of press release of
                            September 20 given on pages 213 and 214 of weekly issue number 260 of

                            telegraphic reply dated <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0098"
                                />today,<note n="20" xml:id="d51fn20">Telegram No. 47, November 10,
                                3 p.m., not printed.</note> on the subject of the interpretation of
                            Article II of the Agreement of July 15, 1934, pledging the parties to
                            refrain from the use of the most-favored-nation clause to obtain the
                            favors enjoyed by virtue of certain multilateral economic
                            conventions.</p>
                        <p>The object of Article II of the Agreement of July 15, is to enable
                            countries which actually perform the obligations of liberalizing
                            economic conventions, fulfilling the requirements of the second
                            paragraph of Article I, to enforce the most-favored-nation clause in
                            treaties (usually bilateral treaties) with parties to such liberalizing
                            conventions, notwithstanding the fact that both parties to the
                            most-favored-nation treaties in question are parties to the Agreement of
                            July 15, which otherwise, by Article I, have renounced the right to
                            enforce the most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, a contracting party, that is, a party to the Agreement of
                            July 15, can, if the condition of Article II is fulfilled, demand the
                            enforcement of the most-favored-nation clause from another contracting
                            party as well as from a non-contracting party.</p>
                        <p>The intention of Article II may perhaps best be illustrated by an
                            example:</p>
                        <p>For instance, let it be supposed that various countries become parties to
                            a liberalizing multilateral economic convention open to all countries.
                            The convention provides for the abolition of quotas so far as the trade
                            of the parties to the convention is concerned, but contains also an
                            extraneous provision which Uruguay cannot accept. Accordingly, Uruguay,
                            though quite willing to abolish quotas, does not become a party. Uruguay
                            and the parties to the convention are parties to the Agreement of July
                            15. Uruguay, in fact, abolishes quotas. Uruguay has most-favored-nation
                            treaties with one or more of the parties to the liberalizing
                            multilateral convention. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article I of
                            the Agreement of July 15, Uruguay, by virtue of Article II, has the
                            right to enforce the most-favored-nation clause so as to obtain the
                            abolition of quotas affecting its trade with the parties to the
                            convention.</p>
                        <p>Article II was inserted as a safeguard against extraneous provisions
                            which might prevent individual countries from accepting membership in
                            multilateral economic conventions which fulfill the requirements of
                            Article I of the Agreement of July 15, 1934.</p>
                        <p>The Department appreciates the care and ability with which you are
                            fulfilling its instructions in this matter and trusts that you may be
                            successful in persuading the Government of Uruguay to become a party to
                            the Agreement of July 15.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Legation’s despatch No.
                            838 of November 21,<note n="21" xml:id="d52fn21">Not printed.</note> as
                            well as previous despatches on the subject of Uruguayan participation to
                            the Agreement of July 15, 1934, now open for signature at the Pan
                            American Union, I have the honor to inform the Department that I find
                            that the objections to the signing by Uruguay which have been advanced
                            by the legal adviser of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Dr. E. E.
                            Buero, are contained in the following example submitted by him as an
                            illustration of the reason why he was persisting in his opposition.</p>
                        <p>He cites the possible case of the United States’ entering into a
                            multilateral convention with a number of countries, including Great
                            Britain, Germany, and France, for the purpose of reducing certain
                            quotas. According to Dr. Buero, as long as Uruguay is not a signatory to
                            the Agreement, the country would be entitled to demand similar
                            reductions of quotas from any of the multilateral convention parties
                            with which it has the most-favored-nation clause. For instance, he calls
                            attention to the fact that Uruguay has a treaty with Germany containing
                            the most-favored-nation clause. He claims that if Uruguay signs the
                            Agreement of July 15, 1934, it would be impossible for its Government to
                            demand reduction of quotas without granting the same privilege in
                            return. Therefore, he states, Uruguay would be at a disadvantage by
                            signing, since, on the basis of the most-favored-nation clause, it can
                            insist on advantages conferred by parties with which it is bound by this
                            clause.</p>
                        <p>The matter is now under discussion with Dr. E. E. Buero, whom I have
                            occasion to meet from time to time. I shall value any comment which the
                            Department may desire to transmit—by air mail preferably, to avoid
                            delay—on the point raised by him in the example given above as cited by
                            him.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In continuation of my despatch No. 849 of
                            November 27, I have the honor to inform the Department that I had a
                            conversation <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0100"/>with Dr. Buero this
                            afternoon, in the course of which he explained to me with considerable
                            frankness the present difficult position of Uruguay in the matter of its
                            participation in the Agreement of July 15, 1934, now open for signature
                            at the Pan American Union. He stated that by inclination, as well as
                            through belief in the soundness of the principles on which the Agreement
                            of July 15, 1934, were based, he would unhesitatingly recommend its
                            signature now by Uruguay. He added, however, that the present economic
                            difficulties with which his country had to contend were such as to
                            prevent him from making such a recommendation. This, he said, he had
                            mentioned to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                        <p>My despatch above cited indicated that Dr. Buero considers that it would
                            be onerous for Uruguay to become a participant to the Agreement under
                            discussion since the country is now favorably situated to secure
                            economic benefits from a number of countries by virtue of agreements
                            which include the most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Buero, I may say, appears to enjoy growing confidence at the Ministry
                            for Foreign Affairs and has been requested recently to act as adviser in
                            the present commercial treaty negotiations which are being carried on by
                            Uruguay with some European countries. He pointed, as an example, to the
                            case of France, between which country and Uruguay commercial
                            negotiations are now in progress, and laid stress on the unfavorable
                            position in which Uruguay finds itself in dealing with that country
                            because of the threat repeatedly and unequivocally employed by the
                            French to cease purchases of Uruguayan meat for the French army and navy
                            whenever Uruguay tries to retain its liberty of action in the matter of
                            the use of exchange derived by the purchase of Uruguayan products made
                            for French account. The position of Uruguay with respect to Great
                            Britain, Germany, and Italy is practically identical as that with France
                            and has given rise to Dr. Buero’s recommendation that the Agreement of
                            July 15, 1934, be not signed by Uruguay until countries of major
                            economic importance, like the European countries above mentioned, become
                            a party to it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Buero stated that, were conditions of our trade with Uruguay such as
                            to give rise to substantial increases in the volume of American
                            purchases of Uruguayan products, the country would not feel so
                            dependent, as it is now, on the goodwill of the European nations.</p>
                        <p>He also referred to the political angle of the subject by stating that it
                            was absolutely out of the question for Uruguay to participate in any
                            multilateral agreements which might cause curtailment of the sales of
                            its products abroad. He states that the signing of the Agreement now
                            open for signature at the Pan American Union would be difficult to
                            explain to the public, as it might imply that Uruguay has to give
                            something in return for any benefits which it might secure <pb n="31"
                                xml:id="pg_31" facs="0101"/>through Article II of the Agreement,
                            whereas by non-participation, the Uruguayan Government could always
                            claim the benefits of the most-favored-nation clause from the countries
                            to which it is bound by this clause, without having to offer any
                            equivalent benefits.</p>
                        <p>I availed myself of the opportunity to present Dr. Buero with a copy of
                            the Spanish translation, prepared at the Legation, of your address
                            before the National Foreign Trade Council on November 1, 1934, and we
                            agreed that we would discuss again the subject of Uruguay’s
                            participation to the Agreement of July 15, 1934.</p>

                                <p>During the course of a formal call made on the President and the
                                    Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina on December 28, the
                                    latter named official handed to the Secretary of State a
                                    memorandum, copy of which is attached, containing suggestions
                                    from the Commission of the League of Nations looking to a
                                    settlement of the Chaco problem. At this time it was arranged
                                    that the Secretary of State should call on the President and the
                                    Minister for Foreign Affairs the following morning, primarily to
                                    discuss this matter. The Secretary was accompanied by Ambassador
                                    Weddell and the Commercial Attaché, <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33"
                                        facs="0103"/>Dr. Dye. The interview took place in the Casa
                                    Rosada and lasted about one hour and a quarter; the
                                    conversations were carried on in an atmosphere of unusual warmth
                                    and cordiality.</p>
                                <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Saavedra Lamas, stated that
                                    Mr. Buero, Uruguayan representative on the League of Nations,
                                    was then in his office and that President Terra of Uruguay hoped
                                    Secretary Hull and President Justo would support the League
                                    efforts to secure an extension of the existing armistice. The
                                    President remarked that he and his Government had already done
                                    everything in their power to promote peace but that he felt
                                    embarrassed at attempting to exert further pressure on the
                                    Paraguayan authorities for fear he would rather weaken his own
                                    influence with them. He added that it was not true that the war
                                    party was in control in Paraguay or that President Ayalá does
                                    not wish to grant an extension of the armistice.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary inquired if the Bolivians were not in accord with
                                    the views set forth in the attached memorandum and if they would
                                    not send troops back to the mines or to farms except 6,500 to be
                                    left for police purposes. The President appeared to assent to
                                    this.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary remarked that both Governments were saying to
                                    United States representatives the same thing, that the other
                                    Government is taking advantage of the armistice with the idea of
                                    continuing the warfare. He added that after “running over” the
                                    Bolivians at President Terra’s house, the Bolivians seemed to
                                    have been entirely agreeable to the suggestions then made.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary stated that in his opinion the only point in the
                                    League proposal to which the Paraguayans could reasonably object
                                    was the reference to a port. He stated that he thought that to
                                    send a military representative from each Government into the
                                    country of the other as representative of the League Commission
                                    would assure the good faith of both parties; that any variation
                                    thereafter would tend to outlaw the offending nation.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Saavedra Lamas then stated various points in the controversy
                                    as he understood them: <list>

                                            recognized and considered in a conference to be called

                                        <item>A meeting of boundary experts under the auspices of
                                            the Pan American Union: the important question is when
                                            can boundary experts get together. In his opinion such
                                            an arrangement would meet the situation.</item>
                                    </list></p>
                                <p>This was the main point; concerning the other matter—an
                                    international loan—he had not made up his mind. President Justo
                                    interrupted here to say: “We would be favorable.”</p>
                                <p>Saavedra Lamas continued that there was the matter of the
                                    appointment of financial experts for the handling of a loan and
                                    looking to the development of certain natural sources of
                                    wealth.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary remarked here that a time beyond any armistice
                                    period would be necessary. Saavedra Lamas appreciated that.</p>
                                <p>Saavedra Lamas remarked that arbitration must come and also
                                    security. The Secretary suggested why not put into the project
                                    the idea in general of an economic conference and leave out the
                                    matter of ports. To this the Minister replied, “That is the best
                                    way.”</p>
                                <p>The Secretary continued that now is a time which may not occur
                                    over long years in which to end the conflict. In view of the
                                    character of the territory, he continued, neither country could
                                    bring the war to a final end in years. To this the President
                                    said: “We both agree.”</p>
                                <p>The Secretary then said that Generals flushed with victory make
                                    military sentiment look like public opinion, and added that if
                                    Paraguay can be made satisfied with the suggestion of the League
                                    Commission to send military experts there, that would meet the
                                    situation for the moment. There would then be no cause for not
                                    agreeing to arbitration and sending back the armies to be
                                    disbanded. Then would come agreement in principle on arbitration
                                    which has been suggested and would work out future relations. He
                                    continued, “I think we should all insist to them that they
                                    accept this idea.”</p>
                                <p>Dr. Saavedra Lamas here remarked that take out the port matter
                                    and put in the question of economic security and Paraguay would
                                    accept.</p>
                                <p>The Minister then asked when the Secretary would be in
                                    Washington, to which Mr. Hull replied that he expected to be
                                    there January 23. Saavedra Lamas then asked if it would be
                                    possible to call the Economic Conference in two months.</p>
                                <p>Saavedra Lamas stated that the first matter to be solved is the
                                    question of financial security and added that he had told
                                    President Terra nothing could be done for the moment in the
                                    matter in advance of the matter of financial arrangements. He
                                    continued that in Argentina it is not a matter of needing money,
                                    but the question would have to be taken up with construction
                                    experts here to carry out the plan.</p>
                                <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0105"/>
                                <p>The Secretary remarked that the President of the League
                                    Commission should bring pressure on Paraguay, adding that public
                                    opinion would be against a country that did not meet this; that
                                    he had told this to Bolivia, in fact had told both sides. That
                                    he felt sure the Argentine Government would not overlook
                                    anything, but if a solution is not found now, it never will be
                                    found.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Saavedra Lamas then proceeded to outline the situation as he
                                    saw it, as follows: <list>

                                <p>The Secretary then expressed his admiration of and thanks to the
                                    President and Minister for Foreign Affairs for the interest they
                                    have taken in this matter, and added, “The moral effect of
                                    stopping this war would be immense in this hemisphere and in
                                    Europe.”</p>
                                <p>Dr. Saavedra Lamas then stated that he wished to take up a second
                                    chapter. He expressed his pleasure in the Secretary’s visit,
                                    said that he regretted taking up material things at a time like
                                    this; that he was sorry the Secretary could not see more of
                                    Argentina.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary said that he was making a careful study of
                                    Argentina and of its resources and stressed the opinion that
                                    there should be a bilateral treaty between the two
                                        countries;<note n="5" xml:id="d54fn5">See section entitled
                                        “Preliminary Discussions Respecting a Trade Agreement

                                    standpoint of the United States in these matters, it was
                                    necessary to act very slowly.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Saavedra Lamas remarked that if they could make a treaty with
                                    only a few and relatively unimportant articles in it, that would
                                    help a great deal. It would mark a beginning.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary remarked again that it was necessary to go slowly
                                    but that with great leadership at this end and leadership at the
                                    other end, working in harmony the future should be bright.</p>
                                <p>The interview closed in an even added atmosphere of warmth and
                                    harmony over that which marked its beginning.</p>

                                    cooperation which has been so happily begun in Montevideo
                                    between the Commission and the Pan American Conference might be
                                    continued in the following form:</p>
                                <p>The League Commission would propose to both parties to sign an
                                    agreement consisting of three parts: <list>

                                            of the Court and Bolivia declaring that she is ready to

                                He said whole matter, especially interior situation in Paraguay,
                                difficult and delicate; that following a conversation with Buero of
                                the League Commission he and the President felt extreme hesitation
                                in doing anything which would seem to take from President Terra his
                                role of chief mediator which Buero had indicated Terra wished to
                                retain. I urged that armistice would terminate in 48 hours and that
                                as one phase of whole situation no stone should be left unturned to
                                extend this adding that Argentine influence at Asunción was far
                                greater than Uruguayan.</p>

                            <p>5. Your 5, January 4, 10 p.m. We feel that the termination of the
                                armistice might have such disastrous consequences and be so deeply
                                regrettable in view of the hope of a peaceful settlement of the
                                controversy held out as the result of the labors of the Montevideo
                                Conference that no possible effort should be omitted to provide at
                                least for the continuation of the armistice in the hope that a
                                passage of time without further conflict may tend to create a more
                                favorable reception for the League Commission’s representations or
                                bring about a possible modification in the negotiations which will
                                create a more favorable current of public opinion in Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, unless you have been otherwise directly instructed by
                                the Secretary or have received instructions from him which would
                                make the following procedure inadvisable in your judgment, you are
                                instructed to request tomorrow morning an audience with President
                                Justo and place before him very clearly the hope of this Government
                                that the Government of Argentina may feel disposed through friendly
                                counsel with the Government of Paraguay to urge a continuation of
                                the armistice for an additional period while negotiations are
                                proceeding. You may say to President Justo that this Government
                                appreciates fully the delicate internal situation which now exists
                                in Paraguay and realizes that there may well be some reason of which
                                    <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0109"/>we are not aware why the
                                Government of Argentina may not desire to exert the full measure of
                                its influence at Asunción. In conclusion you may say that it is only
                                because of our full realization of the desire of the President of
                                the Republic, as so frequently demonstrated, to urge the peaceful
                                solution of this disastrous controversy that we are now expressing
                                our hope that should the exercise of the Argentine Government’s
                                influence in Asunción be possible or useful at this juncture it may
                                be so utilized.</p>
                            <p>There would not be, in our judgment, any reason why a friendly and
                                confidential representation of this character made by the Argentine
                                Government could be construed as interfering in the slightest degree
                                with the initiative originally taken by President Terra.</p>

                            <p>10. Referring to my No. 7, January 7, 3 p.m.,<note n="11"
                                    xml:id="d58fn11">Not printed.</note> I today called on the
                                President. I emphasized to him Department’s message contained in its
                                5, January 5, 6 p.m. Replying, he said that before his departure
                                Thursday for Rosario he had personally urged on chief of Paraguayan
                                delegation extension of armistice and that latter had retorted
                                categorically that his Government would not consent to this since it
                                would prejudice their military situation. The President added that
                                on eight or ten occasions he had urged peace on the respective
                                belligerents giving me the idea, as in his conversation with
                                Secretary Hull that he feared a loss of his influence by further
                                insistence.</p>
                            <p>I then stated the Department’s viewpoint concerning Terra initiative
                                set forth in concluding paragraph of its telegram No. 5 of January
                                5, 6 p.m.</p>
                            <p>During conversation the President twice emphasized that his
                                Government had engagements with the countries bordering Paraguay
                                requiring concerted action.</p>
                            <p>In reply to my request the President said that when the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs returned tomorrow he would ask him to keep me
                                informed of any developments.</p>
                            <p>The President asked me if I had conferred with the League’s
                                representatives to which I replied negatively. This message repeated
                                to Secretary at Lima.</p>

                            <p>11. Referring to my No. 10, January 8, 6 p.m. As stated therein I
                                have not attempted to make any contact with the League of Nations
                                Commission. However, I learned this morning from an absolutely
                                trustworthy authority that the Argentine Government proposes perhaps
                                this afternoon to inform the Governments of Paraguay and Bolivia
                                that unless they agree to accept the peace formula proposed to them
                                by the League of Nations Commission, a copy of which was forwarded
                                to the Department by air mail on January 5,<note n="12"

                                will wash its hands of the matter. There would seem to be no
                                question of sanctions in the event of refusal by either party. My
                                informant stated further that at least one member of the Commission
                                was not hopeful of satisfactory results and felt that the
                                Commission’s departure from Buenos Aires is only a matter of 4 or 5
                                days.</p>
                            <p>I have this afternoon received a visit from the Bolivian Ministers in
                                Uruguay and Brazil, Escalier and Alvesteguí, who informed me that
                                they had seen the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs this
                                morning who had told them of the message from “President Roosevelt”
                                urging Argentine efforts for peace. That they were deeply gratified
                                by this expression of interest. I told them the message to which the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs referred had come from the Department
                                of State and had been transmitted by me to the President of the
                                Republic himself.<note n="13" xml:id="d59fn13">See telegram No. 5,

                            <p>They stated that they feared that in the hands of the Argentine

                                maze of political and economic matters and that what they now hoped
                                my Government might be willing to do would be to urge on the
                                Argentine Government that the cardinal point in the discussions
                                should be the matter of arbitration. I asked if Bolivia had not
                                insisted that arbitration include territory embraced in the Hayes
                                    Award.<note n="14" xml:id="d59fn14"><ref

                            <p>3. In a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs today he
                                said, with reference to Paraguay’s position as to the extension of
                                the armistice, that rather than give Bolivia this opportunity to
                                reestablish itself Paraguay would continue “to occupy forts
                                abandoned by the Bolivians” until the rains set in which would be
                                shortly when an armistice of fact will exist due to the
                                impossibility of continuing warfare and Paraguay will have desired
                                security during negotiations.</p>
                            <p>He said that Paraguay was awaiting the pronouncements to be made by
                                the League Council on the 15th and he thought this should speed up
                                the negotiations.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the departure of some of the members of the League
                                Commission, he stated that Paraguay had no information on the
                                subject but that if such is the case the Paraguayan Government
                                probably will request that the commissioners remain as his
                                Government is now more optimistic that a peace can be worked
                                out.</p>

                                    agreement) susceptible of putting an end to hostilities and of
                                    procuring a fundamental settlement.</p>
                                <p>The armistice proposed on December 18 by Paraguay who invited the
                                    Commission to preside over negotiations for security and peace,
                                    was utilized for attempting at Montevideo, in an atmosphere of
                                    peace and collaboration created by the Pan American Conference
                                    and with the active sympathy of the President of Uruguay acting
                                    as mandatory of the special committee constituted by that
                                    Conference, to put into operation the principles of the
                                    Commission’s plan, to wit (1) the adoption of a procedure for a
                                    fundamental legal settlement each party submitting its claims to
                                    the Permanent Court of International Justice; (2) a regime of
                                    security comprising the withdrawal of the armies to the borders
                                    of the Chaco, their demobilization within a fixed period,
                                    limitation of armaments for a period of time sufficient to
                                    permit not only a fundamental settlement but a durable abatement
                                    of public feeling, and an international control of the foregoing
                                    measures of security; (3) the seeking of measures, leaving aside
                                    all considerations of a territorial order, destined to improve
                                    communications with the exterior not only of Bolivia but of
                                    Paraguay. To further this end the Commission beginning with
                                    December 24, 1933, was able to utilize the resolution adopted by
                                    the International American Conference on the proposal of
                                    Argentina envisaging the convocation of a conference of the
                                    limitrophe states under the auspices of the Pan American
                                        Union.<note n="17" xml:id="d61fn17">See <hi rend="italic"

                                <p>Conversations between the Commission and the Paraguayan military
                                    plenipotentiary and assessor who arrived at Montevideo on
                                    December 29, then information gathered by a delegation of the
                                    Commission which proceeded to Asunción by airplane on January 1,
                                    showed that Paraguay was not ready to accept this plan as a
                                    whole. Representatives of Paraguay desired as a first step the
                                    seeking of a fundamental solution from which the Hayes Zone, the
                                    Rio Paraguay littoral and the hinterland to be determined should
                                    be excluded; the organization of a regime of security being
                                    designed to permit the abatement of public feeling, they deemed
                                    that this regime should carry with it the occupation by
                                    Paraguayan troops of a security zone in the Chaco which would be
                                    entirely evacuated by Bolivian troops. During the 2 days which
                                    followed the return of the Commission’s delegation from Asunción
                                    all efforts to conciliate the points of view of the two
                                    countries and prevent the renewal of hostilities by examining
                                    the chances of success of a security formula were rendered
                                    futile by the expiration of the armistice which the Commission
                                    had requested be prolonged until January 14 but which Paraguay
                                    accepted to prolong only until January 6.</p>
                                <p>The Commission which in the atmosphere created by the armistice
                                    could hope to bring the parties nearer together feel that a
                                    continuation <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0113"/>of the
                                    negotiations was incompatible with the renewal of hostilities
                                    and made this known to the two Governments. As mandatory of the
                                    Council, the Commission leaves it to the latter to appraise a
                                    situation of which it has indicated the essential elements and
                                    awaits on the spot the result of the Council’s

                            <p>13. From a reliable source I learned last night that attitude of the
                                Argentine Government has changed during the last few days and that
                                it is now disposed to bring pressure to bear on Paraguay which
                                apparently cannot continue fighting without Argentine support
                                financially and by munitions and transport. Thus Argentina holds key
                                to situation. Argentina will probably try to induce both parties to
                                agree to 6 months’ armistice. Uruguay now apparently reconciled to
                                transfer of negotiations to Buenos Aires.</p>

                            <p>6. Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs desires that a confidential
                                report be made by me that Bolivia would welcome participation by
                                Brazil (probably in order to counterbalance Argentina) in the
                                negotiations at Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>The above suggestion is claimed to have originated [with?] the
                                Bolivian Sub Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but it was,
                                however, previously discussed by him with the Brazilian
                                Minister.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister again emphasized the point that arbitration
                                should be League Commission’s main preoccupation; all other
                                questions secondary.</p>

                            <p>2. Your 6, January 15, 5 p.m. Largely as the result of misleading and
                                unfounded press reports, the impression has been created that this
                                Government is actively participating in the negotiations at Buenos
                                Aires involving the Chaco dispute.</p>
                            <p>Because of our earnest hope that the progress made during the
                                Montevideo Conference might not be abandoned and the favorable
                                atmosphere resulting from the armistice be lost, the American
                                Ambassador at Buenos Aires was instructed to discuss the matter with
                                the President of Argentina and in the course of his conversation
                                express the hope that Argentine influence in Paraguay might be
                                exerted should the Argentine Government deem it advisable and
                                possible for it to do so, for a continuation of the armistice.<note

                                        attitude of the Argentine Government is that owing to its
                                        membership on the League Council it must work through the
                                        League of Nations Commission in its peace efforts. To this
                                        end it has today suggested the following peace formula to
                                        the League Commission here.</p>

                                    Argentine Government to end Chaco war by insisting on immediate
                                    armistice and arbitration. It is now more manifest than ever
                                    that the interests of both warring countries require immediate
                                    peace and that President Justo and Foreign Minister Saavedra
                                    Lamas hold the key to both. Please present my regards to both of
                                    them and say how greatly I would appreciate something
                                    encouraging and definite from them and how much mine and all

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that during
                                Secretary Hull’s visit in Lima, the Bolivian Minister approached me
                                at the reception at the Embassy to ask that I would say to the
                                Secretary that Bolivia was prepared to agree to prolonging the
                                armistice between Bolivia and Paraguay and to accept the arbitration
                                formula proposed by the League and carry the Chaco dispute to the
                                Hague. I told the Minister I would be glad to tell the Secretary
                                what he had said and to make an opportunity for him to speak to the
                                Secretary.</p>
                            <p>This opportunity occurred after dinner at the Palace on the night of
                                the eleventh. I introduced the Bolivian Minister to the Secretary
                                and the Bolivian Minister repeated what he had said to me in the
                                afternoon. The Secretary replied that he was aware that the
                                Paraguayan Government had desired something of the same sort itself,
                                but that certain Generals and Colonels had overridden wiser counsels
                                out of a fear of losing the military advantages that Paraguay had
                                obtained, and had pitched the two countries back into war. The
                                Secretary indicated the importance of the role of Argentina in the
                                matter and told the Bolivian Minister that he had used all the
                                influence he could towards getting Argentina to exercise good
                                counsel and restraint.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary told the Bolivian Minister pointedly, however, that
                                although he intended to continue to use every effort he could to
                                promote peace between Bolivia and Paraguay, his efforts could only
                                be effective in case he continued to retain the confidence of both
                                Paraguay and Bolivia, thus indicating that what he would do could be
                                in no partisan sense but that it would be as much in the interests
                                of one country as in the other, and that what he had said was not
                                intended to justify Bolivia as against Paraguay, but to support a
                                real effort at peace.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister expressed himself as being immensely gratified
                                by what the Secretary said and has since again expressed his
                                gratification to me, saying, as he had said to the Secretary, that
                                Bolivia regards the Secretary as its great hope for a just
                                settlement of the dispute.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                combination again to undertake direct peace negotiations, always
                                however in cooperation with the Commission. The Commission’s efforts
                                for mediation failing, a revival of united action by the ABCP group
                                might be contemplated but only if prior agreement could be had among
                                themselves to adopt a firm attitude towards the belligerents even to
                                the extent of threatening to cut off supplies. Any efforts in this
                                direction would depend almost entirely on the willingness of
                                Argentina to cooperate. A similar attempt a year ago broke down
                                because Argentina would not exert material pressure on Paraguay, as
                                Chile had with Bolivia. Recent developments did not indicate that
                                Argentine had changed its attitude. However, Argentine could be
                                sounded out and if necessary other American States might be asked to
                                make friendly representations to persuade Argentina to take a firm
                                stand in the interests of peace.</p>

                            <p>9. The Bolivian reply was made last night. It suggests that no new
                                action be made until the attitude of the League is defined, and make
                                following observations regarding formula: It delays fixing terms and
                                bases arbitration, it being easy to foresee that without an accord,
                                arbitration would result impracticable, therefore Bolivia could not
                                retire or demobilize troops. If arbitration were now arranged for,
                                Bolivia would be disposed to consider clauses of security which are
                                not against dignity and sovereignty but these should be precise and
                                clear to avoid future complications. For Bolivia 6 months’ armistice
                                is acceptable only on stipulation that no direct accord being
                                arrived at in the period The Hague Court would automatically take
                                over the question of territorial arbitration within the lines

                            <p>The Bolivian reply ends with opinion that the formula leads certainly

                                        came to the conclusion that the only practical solution
                                        would be for the Commission to discharge its functions taken
                                        as a whole as best it could having regard to the situation
                                        on the spot with a view to bringing about a speedy and
                                        permanent settlement of the dispute.</p>
                                    <p>The fact that the two parties express the wish to see the
                                        Commission resume its work creates a situation which allows
                                        us to hope for a rapid success.</p>
                                    <p>The Council attaches the highest importance to the
                                        continuance of the Commission’s efforts. It considers that
                                        arbitration whatever may be good [<hi rend="italic"

                                        settlement of the dispute. In the present circumstances,
                                        however, the Commission’s mandate cannot be thus limited; it
                                        will have in particular authority to consider every method
                                        for reaching an agreement including for instance the
                                        conclusion of an armistice presenting sufficient guarantees

                                        Commission’s telegram of January 12. Question number 3 in
                                        particular could be investigated with the assistance of the

                                        adopted by the recent Pan American Conference. With regard
                                        to the substantive settlement the Council considers that it

                                    <p>The Council therefore requests its Commission to resume in
                                        conjunction with the parties the study of all the aspects of
                                        the problem and the practical possibilities of a

                            <p>4. Appeals to the two contending Governments “to give proof of
                                political wisdom” and to arrive at a settlement of the dispute

                            <p>10. Bolivia has received through the League Commission a Paraguayan
                                proposal which is summarized by the Foreign Minister as retirement
                                of troops to Paraguayan railhead and Fort Ballivian respectively,
                                policing of evacuated region by Paraguay, agreement not to purchase
                                war material, and probable consideration of arbitration.</p>
                            <p>A Presidential council was held this morning and the Bolivian reply
                                is being studied and will be sent to Buenos Aires within a few days
                                to the effect that an agreement to arbitrate must be the first
                                consideration not security measures as proposed by Paraguay.</p>

                            <p>11. The Bolivian reply was made on the 11th to the Bolivian Minister
                                at Buenos Aires for presentation to the Commission on the 15th. It
                                expresses pleasure that Paraguay accepts principle of arbitration
                                but laments that the proposed treaty is not one of peace but
                                armistice and would not settle basic territorial question, leaving
                                cause for future war; that the Paraguayan seven conditions of
                                security indicate Paraguay progresses in demands as Bolivia
                                cedes.</p>

                            <p>34. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 22, February 14, 8 p.m., I
                                send the following from Mar del Plata:</p>
                            <p>I talked today with Bolivian Minister and also with Foreign Minister
                                Saavedra Lamas.</p>
                            <p>The former expressed himself in pessimistic tone but said he was
                                waiting on the Paraguayan reply to the Bolivian proposal which
                                should be received by the League Commission tomorrow or Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>Saavedra Lamas said he had read the Bolivian proposals and had talked
                                with the Minister of Bolivia which latter country’s attitude now
                                seems more reasonable, while Paraguay is flushed with victory. He
                                told me that the situation of Argentina vis-à-vis the two
                                belligerents <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0122"/>was delicate and
                                while Argentina was happy to collaborate with the League Commission

                            <p>Saavedra Lamas further informed me that he understood oil deposits
                                were in the disputed territory which complicated the matter and that
                                a pipe line might enter into the economic phases of the

                                this pretension, that the real question is an economic one including
                                Bolivia’s outlet.</p>

                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) With regard to the draft treaty the
                                Commission feels that the two states respectively should take the
                                following advantageous points into consideration.</p>
                            <p>“Paraguay: (1) The Hayes Zone excluded from arbitration. (2) Paraguay
                                acquires police rights for all parts of the Chaco important to her.
                                (3) Equality of effectives and control of the production of
                                arms.</p>
                            <p>Bolivia: (1) Legal arbitration assured with only the sacrifice of
                                Bolivia’s position respecting the Hayes Zone. (2) Abandonment of the
                                inquiry concerning responsibility with a view to sanctions which
                                Paraguay has demanded. (3) Limitation of effectives and arms during
                                a reasonable period only and the possibility of increasing them. (4)
                                Police rights which Paraguay wished to refuse. (5) Prompt
                                repatriation of her numerous prisoners. (6) Economic questions not
                                intermingled with juridical questions. (7) Juridical position
                                entirely safeguarded.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) In addition to the foregoing points the
                                Commission feels that both parties should understand that this
                                probably constitutes the last chance for peace which will be
                                presented for some time to come.”</p>
                            <p>2. The Secretary General has in the name of the President of the
                                Council telegraphed to the Governments of the Argentine, Chile,
                                Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Great Britain, France and Italy asking these
                                Governments “to employ their high authority in giving urgent support
                                to the proposals of the Commission and to recommend to the
                                Governments of the two parties to accept these bases for an
                                honorable and equitable solution susceptible of restoring peace”.
                                The telegram to the three European powers includes a résumé of the
                                essentials of the draft treaty.</p>

                            <p>3. The Secretary General has communicated to me a request in like
                                terms to the American Government. (Note Consulate’s 31, February 16,

                            <p>4. The Secretary General would very much appreciate receiving advices
                                respecting such pertinent action as may be taken by the United
                                States Government.</p>
                            <p>5. None of the foregoing is yet being made public here.</p>

                                Brazilian Government concerning the proposal and furthermore whether
                                it would be disposed to press for its acceptance by the Bolivian

                                Bolivia and Paraguay. It is our earnest hope that the suggestion so
                                proposed which seems in our judgment to offer an equitable basis for
                                the pacific solution of the existing controversy may be accepted by

                            <p>30. Department’s 18, February 25, 5 p.m. Brazilian Government
                                considers League formula fair basis for peaceful solution but at
                                present it hesitates to offer any suggestions to the two parties,
                                being convinced that Paraguayan Government cannot accept any
                                solution agreeable to Bolivia, and that such acceptance would
                                inevitably result in overthrow of the Government. Present feeling is
                                that war must proceed further, and possibly result in stalemate
                                before friendly good offices can have any helpful effect.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Office reluctant to put foregoing considerations in writing
                                but is instructing Brazilian representative at Bern to call on
                                Secretary General and state that while Brazil is most anxious for
                                peaceful solution and ready and anxious to contribute does not, for
                                reasons stated above, feel that its efforts would be fruitful at
                                this time.</p>

                                League’s formula. Uruguayan Foreign Office has given me copy of
                                identic telegrams sent yesterday by the President of Uruguay to the
                                Presidents of Paraguay and Bolivia expressing earnest wish that

                                opinion that the most direct, definite and economic arrangements
                                possible are indispensable between two nations which are not in a
                                position to await results of long drawn out negotiations but should
                                soon undertake to repair the ravages of war.</p>
                            <p>Terra and the Foreign Office are of the opinion that the formula will
                                not succeed because if one belligerent accepts the other is sure to
                                reject <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0129"/>and vice versa and
                                very confidentially observe that the League Commission in again
                                seeking the cooperation of Terra is paying the price for its rather
                                summary treatment of him when the Commission left suddenly for
                                Buenos Aires after the conference. In short Terra clings to his
                                economic proposals which he explained personally to you.</p>

                                Affairs this afternoon informed me that a further examination of the
                                League Commission formula, which he again emphasized he had no hand
                                in drafting, showed it to be defective and that he had so informed
                                the President of the Commission. He had last night invited the
                                Paraguayan Delegate and Minister to discuss entire subject with him
                                and with an Argentine officer, formerly president of an Argentine
                                military commission in Paraguay, and that he and the latter had
                                urged upon the Paraguayan representatives that nothing was to be
                                gained by a prolongation of the war and that the occupation of
                                Bolivia was unthinkable, adding that Argentina’s neutral attitude
                                would be strictly continued. He urged that the foregoing be
                                communicated to the President of Paraguay. I asked if the foregoing
                                was not equivalent to at least a qualified support of the League
                                formula to which he replied negatively saying his support was toward
                                achievement of peace and that he was again urging this through his
                                Ministers in the two belligerent capitals. He added that he was very
                                pessimistic as to the success of the Commission negotiations and
                                that it now looked as if American countries would have to renew
                                their friendly offices.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs also discussed the matter today at
                                luncheon with his legal adviser and the Bolivian Minister urging a
                                reasonable attitude on Bolivia’s part.</p>

                            <p>13. The President called me to his house tonight and said that steps
                                have been taken to take advantage of the 3 days’ extension that
                                Bolivia has requested in preparing reply. He said that the
                                Commission proposal as submitted will be rejected. The main
                                objection is the inclusion in the territory to be arbitrated of the
                                territory on the West bank of the Paraguay River and its
                                corresponding hinterland which he says is the life blood of
                                Paraguayan economy. The President expressed his opinion that this
                                was introduced into the negotiations by Bolivia for political
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>The unexpected fairness of the Commission’s proposal has made
                                favorable impression in best circles here. He expressed his belief
                                that peace would be forthcoming in the near future though possibly
                                not through Commission’s efforts.</p>

                            <p>15. Extension until Saturday granted for the reply. Jockeying seems
                                likely, Bolivia more wholeheartedly accepting to the degree that
                                reports indicate Paraguayan rejection of the proposal.</p>
                            <p>An expectation here appears to be that the replies on March 3 will be

                            <p>26. Department’s telegram 23, February 25th. In a conversation with
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning he informed me that
                                according to his information Bolivia may accept the League proposal
                                but that Paraguay will reject it. However, since Chile is a member
                                of the League of Nations he has instructed his respective Legations
                                to recommend without comment its acceptance.</p>
                            <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0131"/>
                            <p>The Minister was outspokenly unimpressed with the formula and I am
                                convinced that he will not support it effectively. He feels that it
                                fails to take into consideration the psychological and legal
                                factors, namely, that Paraguay is the victor and is in possession.
                                Therefore, he considers it unreasonable to require the victor to
                                withdraw to the river miles behind its railheads. He understands
                                that the military group in Paraguay would never consent to this
                                measure even were the Government disposed to accede, in which latter
                                event a revolution would immediately start. In the second place he
                                is reliably informed that Paraguay will not agree to the inclusion
                                in the arbitration of the Paraguay River and the hinterland. He
                                feels that the first objection could be removed by modifying the
                                formula so as to require the withdrawal of Paraguayan troops only to
                                the railheads but he can see no solution to the second article.</p>
                            <p>The Minister was frankly pessimistic about the situation and was
                                convinced that the formula will not be accepted. Therefore he feels
                                that in the event that the League proposal is definitely rejected
                                the time will have come to take drastic measures to compel the
                                cessation of hostilities and the definitive settlement of the
                                controversy. He believes that this can be attained only through the
                                close cooperation of the neighboring countries supported by the
                                United States in coercing the belligerents. To that end he will be
                                disposed to recommend that each of the neighboring countries take
                                necessary steps to prevent the importation of war material and food
                                supplies, except in the quantity required by the civil population.
                                He added that he would also propose the suspension of diplomatic
                                relations with the country refusing to submit the controversy to
                                arbitration. However, prior to Saturday when the belligerents must
                                reply to the League the Minister does not wish to take any action
                                other than that outlined in the first paragraph.</p>

                                    Nations is reciprocal distrust, principally on the part of
                                    Paraguay which feels suspension of hostilities will permit
                                    Bolivia to prepare a new attack; the most efficacious
                                    cooperation neutrals can proffer for the success of the
                                    mediation is the effective guarantee that they will in no case
                                    consent that hostilities shall be renewed either on the one side
                                    or on the other on any pretext whatever.</p>
                                <p>The idea of such a guarantee was suggested by Dr. Polo during the
                                    mediation of the four neighboring powers and was well received
                                    by the Governments of Argentina, Brazil and Chile. It was
                                    limited, however, to a purely moral character, a limitation
                                    which was not in the thought of Dr. Polo when he first made the
                                    suggestion and rendered his suggestion relatively
                                    inefficacious.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Polo believes that if an effective guarantee were offered
                                    upon the initiative of the American Government and with the
                                    support of the four neighboring powers all the distrust which
                                    now impedes the arrangement of peace would disappear and the
                                    suspension of hostilities would be brought much closer.”</p>

                                confidentially that his original suggestions in this sense (see

                                the attitude of Brazil which felt that to take a decided step of
                                this kind might involve the neighboring powers in responsibilities
                                it would appear preferable to avoid. Dr. Polo feels these fears are
                                unfounded and that an effective blockade against the entry of any
                                further munitions and war supplies could be carried out without
                                undue involvement and would bring the two countries to reason.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Polo is keeping closely informed of conditions in Bolivia and
                                tells me his reports indicate extremely unstable political affairs
                                with the public turning strongly against Salamanca and the army and
                                avoiding the last call to the colors in every way possible. Bolivian
                                Minister today urgently requested measures along the Peruvian
                                frontier to prevent Bolivians subject to military duty from escaping
                                into Peru.</p>

                            <p>42. Consulate’s 35, February 24, noon. Chaco Commission has informed
                                Secretariat to the following effect, having received the replies of
                                the two parties and subsequently having convoked their
                                representatives in conference. The Commission found their points of
                                view so divergent that it considered the chances of success of
                                further negotiations too slight to justify its remaining any longer.
                                The Commission announces its departure for Europe on March 15 from
                                Montevideo on the Steamship <hi rend="italic">Avila Star</hi>.

                            <p>237. 1. Alvarez del Vayo, Chairman of the Chaco Commission, called
                                this morning and stated that he wanted to tell me how much he was
                                indebted to the Secretary of State for the valuable counsel and
                                assistance that the Secretary had given him in South America. At the
                                same time he told me that as soon as there was available a copy of
                                the Commission’s report on which they were now working he would hand
                                it to me. I shall not enter into details of Del Vayo’s conversation
                                as I understand from him that he went over the situation in detail
                                with Weddell who reported from Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>2. Costa du Rels, the Bolivian delegate, called immediately
                                subsequently to put me in touch with what he knew regarding the
                                report and stated that the Bolivian Minister at Washington had urged
                                him <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0136"/>to give me particulars
                                about the matter as seen from Geneva for the information of the
                                Secretary of State.</p>
                            <p>3. Recently Havas has carried several despatches from Washington
                                which purport to show a considerable interest on the part of our
                                Government in the Chaco matter as well as a possibility that the
                                American Government might concern itself more directly with the
                                settlement of this dispute. Members of the Secretariat have already
                                inquired entirely informally as to whether this indicated that the
                                Government of the United States contemplated separating its action
                                from that of the Council. Normally I would take advantage of the
                                presence of the Commission here to get whatever information I could
                                to report to you. If, however, there is any question of a departure
                                by us from our policy of cooperation with League efforts for the
                                settlement of the dispute I should query the desirability of taking
                                any steps locally. Would appreciate advice.</p>

                                                attention to the question and in the interval
                                                between the sessions to take any measures that it
                                                may deem advisable.</item>

                            <p>115. Consulate’s 112, May 30, 8 p.m., paragraph 4.<note n="44"
                                    xml:id="d104fn44">Not printed.</note> The following is a summary
                                of the Council meeting this morning:</p>
                            <p>1. Najera, President of the Committee of Three, recalled the
                                Council’s resolution of May 19 (Consulate’s 83, May 19, 10 p.m.,
                                paragraph 2(B)) and requested the two parties to state their views.
                                He further remarked that the incident relating to the non-observance
                                by Paraguay of the rules of international law had been settled by
                                the latter’s telegram (Consulate’s 106, May 30, noon<note n="44"
                                    xml:id="d104fn45">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                            <p>2. The Bolivian representative repeated previous arguments advancing
                                nothing which would seem in effect to indicate a change of attitude
                                toward the proposals for settlement contained in the Chaco
                                Commission’s report. He laid particular stress on the implication in
                                the report that the dispute related to vast territory and was not a
                                mere boundary question as Paraguay maintains. The whole territory
                                    <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0138"/>should, therefore, be
                                submitted to arbitration. With regard to Commission’s formula for
                                settlement he objected to the exclusion of the Hayes Zone from the
                                matter to be submitted to arbitration implying that this was a
                                political concession due to Paraguay’s recent victories.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the embargo proposal he urged the Council not to
                                undertake such a measure maintaining that an embargo could not be
                                applied equally to both countries due to the more favorable
                                geographical position of Paraguay. Such a measure he said would be
                                tantamount to the unjust application of sanctions against Bolivia.
                                Under article 16 of the Covenant sanctions could be applied only
                                against the aggressor which had not been determined by the
                                Commission. He desired that the Covenant be applied but in view of
                                the difficulty of an investigation into responsibilities he would
                                consent to the adjournment of that question.</p>
                            <p>Bolivia was prepared to accept the legal formula proposed by the
                                Commission, but insisted that the whole matter should be submitted
                                to arbitral settlement without regard to political considerations
                                such as that involved in the exclusion of the Hayes Zone. If the
                                procedure under article 11 proved unsuccessful his Government would
                                invoke article 13.</p>
                            <p>3. Paraguay resumed previous arguments stating in particular that no
                                settlement could be accepted which did not include adequate
                                guarantees of security. The position in regard to the Hayes Zone was
                                maintained.</p>
                            <p>4. The representative of Mexico then read the text of a telegram
                                despatched to the two parties by the Mexican Foreign Minister
                                appealing for an armistice and a final settlement before the
                                impending embargo should be applied. The replies of the two parties,
                                which he likewise read, indicate no change of position. Bolivia
                                again suggested an arbitral judgment and that Mexico act as
                                intermediary to that effect. In regard to the latter statement
                                Najera declared that he considered the League as the last instance
                                and that further intervention of third parties was not
                                desirable.</p>
                            <p>5. The Argentine representative urged the parties to come to an
                                agreement before the application of an embargo and suggested to the
                                Council that it proceed prudently in regard to the embargo proposal
                                in the hope that some result be obtained either through direct
                                negotiations or under the auspices of the neighboring countries.</p>
                            <p>6. The Bolivian representative then stated that since the
                                representative of Paraguay had not responded to his appeal for an
                                arbitral settlement on a legal basis he saw no hope of success under
                                article 11 and considered it useless to invoke article 13. He
                                requested the Council, therefore, to deal with the matter under
                                article 15.</p>
                            <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0139"/>
                            <p>7. The President of the Council stated that the question of the
                                application of article 15 would be considered forthwith. He
                                requested the Committee of Three to meet as soon as possible to
                                consider how their work might be affected by the Bolivian request
                                and to expedite their report on the embargo.</p>

                            <p>1. Am informed that in a private meeting this morning the Council
                                acceded to Bolivia’s request to deal with the dispute under article
                                15 of the Covenant.<note n="46" xml:id="d105fn46"><hi rend="italic"

                            <p>With reference to paragraph 1 of that article the Secretary General
                                stated that since the Chaco Commission had already rendered its
                                report he was prepared to submit at once full information on the
                                subject it being necessary merely to put the documentation in order
                                and publish a few additional documents.</p>
                            <p>With reference to paragraph 2 the Paraguayan declared that since his
                                Government had only just received the Commission’s report there
                                would be some delay in submitting his Government’s statement. The
                                Bolivian made light of any necessity for delay and asserted that
                                though his Government had likewise just received the report there
                                would be no difficulty about submitting a statement very
                                shortly.</p>
                            <p>The parties were requested to submit their statements as soon as

                                requested that the consideration of the dispute under article <pb
                                    n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0140"/>15 be referred to the
                                Assembly. This is construed, however, as not preventing the
                                continuation of Council action under article 11 pending the
                                convening of the Assembly.</p>
                            <p>The legal section of the Secretariat is considering whether the
                                dispute may be placed directly on the agenda of the League or
                                whether prior action by the Council is necessary. Bolivia may
                                endeavor to have called an extraordinary session of the Council for
                                this purpose.</p>
                            <p>League authorities will endeavor to avoid the convocation of an
                                extraordinary session of the Assembly. The presumption now is that
                                the questions will be brought before the ordinary session in
                                September.</p>
                            <p>It would appear to me that the underlying reason for Bolivia’s
                                referring the dispute to the Assembly is to ensure its consideration
                                by body comprising a large number of Latin American states rather
                                than by the Council which Bolivia regards as being dominated in
                                Latin American matters by Argentina.</p>

                            <p>219. Avenol asked me to call on him today and exposed to me his views
                                on the present posture of the Chaco question vis-à-vis the
                                League.</p>
                            <p>He stated that the era of general effort and indefinite negotiations
                                had come to an end due to the special situation created by Bolivia’s
                                appeal to the Assembly under article 15. This through the “6 months”
                                provision required a definitive report in November which would state
                                either, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), the terms of a settlement quite
                                impracticable or, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), that no settlement had
                                been reached. If such report was to the effect that a settlement had
                                not been reached an entirely new situation would arise the handling
                                of which he could not foresee at this time. He said that in his
                                opinion the best way to meet the present exigency was by the
                                appointment by the forthcoming Assembly of a small committee to sit
                                in Geneva and to be composed of the present Council Committee of
                                Three, Mexico, Spain and Czechoslovakia; of the League bordering
                                states Argentina, Chile and Peru; and if possible of the United
                                States and Brazil, such a committee to meet as soon as possible
                                after it is set up, its competence technically expiring in November.
                                He added that he felt the committee he had suggested to be an ideal
                                one as it was properly composed chiefly of the states having the
                                greatest concern with the matter and of sufficient states <pb n="71"
                                    xml:id="pg_71" facs="0141"/>urging the interests of the League.
                                He asked me if I thought the United States would be willing to
                                participate on such a committee.</p>
                            <p>I replied that I could give no opinion but that I felt it probable
                                that the United States would at least not be willing to exercise the
                                power of voting on measures which envisaged action under the
                                Covenant. Avenol replied that he thoroughly understood such a
                                position but that a general statement that we would not vote in the
                                committee might be avoided by a formula to the effect that our
                                participation was with the understanding that we would not vote on
                                matters falling under the Covenant, his idea being that the
                                committee’s findings would be in two parts, (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>), on the dispute itself and, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>),
                                recommendations presumably in part at least involving Covenant
                                action. He felt that we might be prepared to vote respecting part
                                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>).</p>
                            <p>I commented on the absence on such a committee of the great League
                                powers and he stated that he felt that better results would be
                                obtained in keeping the committee small, that one great power could
                                not be included without the inclusion of all and that in essence the
                                principal League powers were not interested in the means of
                                settlement but solely in restoring peace and in the preservation by
                                some settlement of the integrity and prestige of the Covenant. My
                                personal belief is that in addition to the reasons stated there is a
                                desire to avoid difficulties arising from possible conflict of
                                interests among the great powers in this question, the Italian
                                position in the former League Chaco Commission being a case in
                                point, and furthermore a desire to avoid additional loss of prestige
                                to the League through the possible failure of an endeavor in which
                                the great League powers played an important role.</p>
                            <p>Avenol stated that in view of the limited period under which the
                                committee could act he hoped it would be set up as early as possible
                                in the Assembly session. He intends to approach Brazil immediately
                                in the sense of the foregoing. He requested me to ascertain
                                informally and confidentially from you respecting the willingness of
                                the United States to participate in such an arrangement.</p>

                                on Avenol and thank him for a frank exposition of views on the

                                the United States, Argentina, and Brazil are now working on with
                                Paraguay and Bolivia, and which gives real ground for hope. If the
                                plan is accepted without reservation by the two interested parties,
                                six other American Republics will be called in to cooperate in the
                                conciliation discussions, with the added proviso that if this
                                procedure is not ultimately successful, the dispute will be
                                submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice. With this
                                set-up in prospect, we are distinctly apprehensive of the
                                possibility of crossed wires in case an active Committee should now
                                be set up by the League.</p>
                            <p>You may review briefly to Avenol the various evidences of full
                                cooperation we have shown the League throughout the course of this
                                dispute, notably at the time of the Montevideo Conference last
                                winter. Our primary concern has been to help find a solution,
                                whether through inter-American cooperation, or through the more
                                universal international cooperation of the League. At the moment the
                                prospects of success through the cooperative efforts of the United
                                States, Argentina, and Brazil seem the brighter. You may accordingly
                                tell Avenol, in strictest confidence, that we feel certain of a
                                similar desire on his part to assist the more hopeful procedure in
                                so far as he can do so consistently with the binding provisions of
                                the Covenant. We therefore suggest that he may be able to evolve
                                ways and means of restricting the activity of the League at this
                                moment to a bare minimum.</p>
                            <p>In the circumstances, Avenol will understand why we feel it would be
                                inadvisable for us to participate in the Committee he suggested.</p>

                            <p>103. The Department has received a cable from the American Consul in
                                Geneva reporting an interview on August 27th with the Secretary
                                General of the League of Nations, in which the latter brought up the
                                Chaco question. Avenol stated that Bolivia’s appeal to the Assembly
                                under Article 15 required, under the 6 months’ provision, a
                                definitive report in November which would declare either that (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) the terms of a settlement were quite
                                impracticable, or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that no settlement had
                                been reached. Avenol added that in his opinion, the <pb n="73"
                                    xml:id="pg_73" facs="0143"/>best way to meet the present
                                exigency was by the appointment by the forthcoming Assembly of a
                                small committee to be composed of the present Council committee of
                                three, namely, Mexico, Spain, and Czechoslovakia; of the League
                                bordering states, Argentina, Chile, and Peru; and if possible, of
                                the United States and Brazil, the competence of such Committee to
                                expire in November.</p>
                            <p>Please bring the above immediately to the attention of Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas and state that it is, of course, impossible for the United
                                States to form part of such a Committee and that inasmuch as neither
                                the United States nor Brazil are members of the League of Nations
                                and since Argentina is both a member and represented on the Council,
                                it would seem appropriate that Dr. Saavedra Lamas himself discuss
                                the present situation frankly with the Secretary General. In the
                                opinion of this Government, the recent negotiations for a settlement
                                of the Chaco dispute under the auspices of Argentina, Brazil, and
                                the United States have now reached the point where a successful
                                outcome in the near future is hoped for, and it would seem
                                exceedingly regrettable to prejudice the probability of success by
                                any confusion which might arise as the result of active negotiations
                                being now undertaken by the League Committee in addition to the
                                negotiations already in progress. It would further appear to be
                                expedient to point out to the Secretary General and the Council of
                                the League that during the course of the past year, the problem of
                                finding a solution has been under the jurisdiction of the League,
                                and that the American Republics, including the United States, have
                                cooperated with and supported the endeavors of the League Committee,
                                notably at the time of the holding of the Montevideo Conference;
                                that the objective sought in the present negotiations is the same as
                                that sought by the League and that it would appear to be in the
                                interest of the League itself to await so far as may be possible
                                under the Covenant the outcome of the present negotiations before
                                undertaking any further active participation in the settlement of
                                the dispute. You may state that the views of this Government are
                                being informally communicated to the Secretary General of the
                                League.</p>
                            <p>Please cable the Department the views which Dr. Saavedra Lamas may
                                express.</p>

                                might be inclined to communicate informally its views in a similar

                            <p>220. Upon Avenol’s return to Geneva this morning I took early
                                occasion to call on him and to inform him of the substance of the
                                Department’s 87, August 30, 4 p.m. The Secretary General expressed
                                his appreciation of the exposition of the current efforts of the
                                United States, Argentina and Brazil respecting the Chaco and in
                                particular of your views regarding the prospects for success of such
                                efforts and the situation thus created. He is fully sensible of your
                                cooperative policy respecting all international efforts vis-à-vis
                                the Chaco as clearly demonstrated in Montevideo of which he feels
                                your message to him is further evidence.</p>
                            <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0145"/>
                            <p>1. He reexpressed the definite change in the juridical position of
                                the League respecting the dispute arising from the appeal to the
                                Assembly and emphasized the time limit imposed on League action.</p>
                            <p>2. He discussed the previous policy of the League in withholding
                                action in deference to the Washington negotiations earlier in the
                                dispute. While such policy may have been an expedient position for
                                the League to take at that time it had nevertheless been a difficult
                                and somewhat questionable position for the League to assume in the
                                face of its responsibilities under the Covenant in particular in the
                                face of a factual condition of warfare which has continued to the
                                present. He looked with apprehension upon a more protracted lack of
                                activity of the League in the Chaco as subversive of an internal and
                                external regard for its responsibilities and prestige with a
                                consequent relaxation of the sense of general international
                                responsibility in all fields.</p>
                            <p>3. Thus particularly in view of the new juridical responsibilities of
                                the League which will arise immediately upon the convening of the
                                Assembly on September 11th he felt that the Assembly could not
                                withhold taking active measures unless fully satisfied that measures
                                taken elsewhere were being conducted under a satisfactory procedure
                                which likewise gave some promise of success. This was of course
                                entirely for the Assembly itself to decide vis-à-vis the situation
                                as the Assembly would view it.</p>
                            <p>4. I expressed to Avenol the opinion that it was reasonable to
                                suppose that Argentina as a party to the present American efforts
                                and also as a member of the League would be the Government which
                                would expose and advocate either formally or informally the
                                character and the prospects of success of these arrangements.</p>
                            <p>In reply Avenol said that he had no information whatsoever from
                                Argentina, his sole source of information being what I had told him
                                and what he had read in the press.</p>
                            <p>I then asked him whether he would make inquiries of the Argentine
                                Government or whether a voluntary statement to him on the part of
                                the Argentine Government which he could circulate to the League
                                would be helpful.</p>
                            <p>In reply he said that he would not make such an inquiry and that he
                                would prefer that Argentina make no official statement to him at
                                present as respecting the first it could be charged and respecting
                                the second it could be inferred that he had been a party to
                                activities which were derogatory of the responsibility of the
                                Assembly or of the expression of its authority in determining its
                                action.</p>
                            <p>5. He felt that the only course of action which could reconcile the
                                position of the League and the position of the American efforts
                                would be a formal communication to the Assembly (or to an Assembly
                                committee <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0146"/>which might be set

                                American formula together with some estimate of the prospects of a
                                successful issue based on such a formula. A mere statement that
                                hopeful efforts were being undertaken outside of the League would he
                                felt not be sufficient. Likewise any assumption of responsibility on
                                the part of the participants in such efforts could not in itself be
                                construed by the League as a reason for foregoing its own
                                responsibility. While it was for the Assembly to arrive at its own
                                decision he personally felt that it could not for the reasons
                                discussed above lay aside its responsibility without reasons for
                                doing so which would be fully accepted by the Assembly and by public
                                opinion.</p>
                            <p>6. He said that he had taken up the matter of participating in an
                                Assembly committee with the Brazilian representative as forecast in

                                had received no definite answer he had been given to understand that
                                Brazil would probably follow the lead of the United States.</p>

                                after he had given the matter further consideration. He stated that
                                he did not perceive that there could be any modification in the
                                principles respecting the necessary position of the League as he had
                                expressed it but that he might have some added considerations to
                                present or suggestions respecting procedures.</p>
                            <p>8. He expressed the hope that you would understand the position of
                                the League and his own position as he had explained it and that
                                exchanges of views might continue between you and himself with a
                                view to arriving at the fullest cooperation in all efforts.</p>
                            <p>9. I feel that it would be most helpful to me to receive the
                                Department’s reaction to the foregoing before my further
                                conversation with Avenol.</p>
                            <p>10. Respecting the American efforts in themselves Avenol expressed
                                only the following opinions. <list>

                                        neutral in fact and he was thus apprehensive that a

                                    Foreign Affairs, which in effect is only reiteration of stand

                                    conciliation formula is due to’ the fact that Bolivia has no

                                    Buenos Aires and therefore prefers action of League of Nations.

                            <p>Council adopted a resolution on the Chaco matter transferring the
                                dispute to the Assembly in accordance with paragraph 9 of article
                                No. 15 of the Covenant. The resolution provides further that “The
                                duties which the Council may have to fulfill in accordance with the
                                Covenant remain unaffected by the present decision.”</p>
                            <p>The only discussion consisted of statements by the representatives of

                                latter repeated the reservation previously-advanced concerning the
                                legal objections to the application of article 15 during the
                                continuation of hostilities.</p>

                            <p>1. Avenol has not asked to see me and in the absence of instructions
                                I have not sought to see him.</p>
                            <p>2. Today, however, Najera, Chairman of the Council Committee,
                                informed me as follows: <list>

                                    <item>The Argentine Ambassador showed him a telegram from the
                                        Argentine Foreign Minister to the effect that American peace
                                        efforts respecting the Chaco appeared very hopeful. Najera
                                        desired to make official use of this information but the
                                        Ambassador stated this could not be done until he had
                                        received authority from his Government. This he agreed to
                                        seek.</item>

                                                which could be made public to the effect that a
                                                satisfactory settlement at Buenos Aires was imminent
                                                the Assembly would not take up the question for at
                                                least 1 or 2 weeks.</item>

                                            <item>Should the statement be unpromising the Assembly
                                                would at once take action on the dispute.</item>

                                                indicate that the peace plans were progressing
                                                favorably but that a settlement was not probable
                                                until after the Assembly session on the call for the
                                                Assembly of an expose of the peace project which the
                                                Assembly found satisfactory the Assembly would
                                                probably be willing to withhold independent action
                                                pending the results of such efforts.</item>
                                        </list></item>

                            <p>Najera believes that the Ambassador transmitted the substance of the
                                foregoing to his Government.</p>
                            <p>It will be noted that this is in general line with Avenol’s policy as
                                expressed in my number 220 paragraphs 3 and 5.</p>
                            <p>3. The probable procedure should the Assembly act would be reference
                                to the Sixth Committee which would consider the formation of a
                                consultative committee (my 219, August 27, 5 p.m.) if that course
                                seemed desirable.</p>

                            <p>268. 1. Yesterday evening in the Sixth Committee the Bolivian
                                delegate speaking on instructions from his Government made a
                                statement which is interpreted here as announcing the termination of
                                the <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0151"/>Buenos Aires
                                negotiations. I am informed that a like statement was to be
                                delivered by Bolivian representatives at Washington, Rio de Janeiro
                                and Buenos Aires. The Bolivian delegate began by declaring that he
                                had been authorized to communicate to the Assembly all the documents
                                necessary for making clear the Bolivian position with regard to the
                                Argentine proposal. These documents had been circulated. He then
                                continued</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I am to inform the Assembly that the United States and Brazil
                                    considered the proposals for amendment submitted by Bolivia to
                                    the Argentine proposal to be reasonable.</p>
                                <p>In the second place I must state that if my Government accepted
                                    the consultation offered to it on July 12 it did so because
                                    there was still a certain interval that must elapse before the
                                    meeting of the Assembly which is the only jurisdiction that
                                    Bolivia at present recognizes.</p>
                                <p>The Bolivian Government therefore thought it ought [not?] to omit
                                    the possibility of any negotiation that might be calculated to
                                    lead to the end of the conflict. At no time, however, have we
                                    thought that these negotiations could in any way whatsoever
                                    delay, impede or break up the procedure to which appeal had been
                                    made before the Assembly. My Government, therefore, remains
                                    firmly attached to this view. It has put the dispute before the
                                    Assembly and it is from the Assembly that it awaits a solution
                                    either by means of conciliation or by way of
                                    recommendation.”</p></quote>
                            <p>2. The Paraguayan representative declared that although his
                                Government still entertained legal doubts in regard to the integral
                                application of article 15 he had been instructed to state that his
                                Government hoped that the Assembly would not terminate before
                                obtaining definite results in the direction of the restoration of
                                peace and that it was desirous of doing nothing which would in any
                                way impede the course of procedure directed towards that end.</p>
                            <p>3. Cantilo followed with a noncommittal statement which leaves the
                                Argentine position ambiguous.</p>
                            <p>4. The Chilean representative pronounced himself unequivocally in
                                favor of immediate action by the League.</p>
                            <p>5. The Peruvian representative made a noncommittal statement.</p>

                            <p>269. Immediately following meeting of the Sixth Committee described
                                in the Consulate’s 268, September 25, 9 a.m. Avenol asked me to come
                                to see him.</p>
                            <p>He referred to the statement I had made to him in line with the <pb
                                    n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0152"/>Department’s 96, September
                                21, 1 p.m. and said that the Brazilian Minister had made a statement
                                to him in similar terms.</p>
                            <p>He said that at the end of last week it had been found impossible to
                                form, as had been originally planned, a satisfactory League
                                Commission regarding the Chaco composed chiefly of American states.
                                It has then been decided to constitute a large committee similar to
                                the Sino-Japanese Committee of nineteen composed of the Council
                                states and certain interested Latin American League states.<note

                                resolution setting up this committee was to take note of the Buenos
                                Aires mediation and the committee acting in theory under the
                                conciliation procedure of paragraph 3 of article 15 would
                                nevertheless not meet and would take no action until the end of a
                                time set for the termination of the conciliation procedure probably
                                November 1st. In other words the Buenos Aires mediation would be
                                regarded as tantamount to League conciliation and the League would
                                remain quiet during the period stated and in no way interfere with
                                action at Buenos Aires. If the Buenos Aires mediation was not
                                successful by November 1 the committee would meet about that date
                                and proceed immediately to draw up a report under paragraph 4 of
                                article 15. If during the period of the preparation of the report a
                                settlement was effected elsewhere the report would not be acted
                                upon. If however no set settlement was reached the report would be
                                made to an extraordinary Assembly before December 9, the date upon
                                which Bolivia made her appeal to the Assembly under article 15 being
                                construed as the beginning of the “6 months’ period”.</p>
                            <p>Avenol then said that the declarations made by Bolivia in my telegram
                                under reference entirely changed the situation. He stated that
                                whatever motives might lie behind this action of Bolivia a formal
                                statement of that import on the part of one of the disputants must
                                be accepted as a technical notification of the termination of the
                                Buenos Aires negotiations.</p>
                            <p>In this situation the present plan is immediately to set up a
                                committee as described above which will at once proceed to the
                                preparation of a report for presentation to the extraordinary
                                Assembly. There may also be appointed a subcommittee of conciliation
                                to act during the preparation of the report. It is not yet clear
                                whether an effort will be made to obtain the participation of the
                                United States and Brazil in such a committee.</p>
                            <p>I wish to emphasize that the foregoing is only Avenol’s view as to
                                what action the Assembly will take. Avenol added, however, that he
                                believed that no meeting of the Sixth Committee would be held for
                                general discussion until the presentation to it of this plan.</p>

                                        had made formal objections to the two disputants and the

                                        understood as a definite notification that the Buenos Aires
                                        mediation had terminated.</item>

                                    <item>Bolivia’s reason for pressing for action in the quarter
                                        where immediate action seems most possible to achieve is due
                                        to the present situation respecting the embargo. She feels
                                        the longer the embargo continues the greater will be her
                                        disadvantage inasmuch as Paraguay has current access to
                                        materials of war despite the embargo which access is not
                                        available to Bolivia.</item>

                                    <item>With reference to the proposed League plan of setting up a
                                        large Assembly committee (Consulate’s 269, September 25, 10
                                        a.m.), Bolivia does not favor that type of committee but
                                        rather one with a larger proportionate representation of
                                        Latin American states. I gained the impression, which was
                                        however an indefinite one, that Bolivia objected to Italy’s
                                        participation in such a committee.</item>

                            <p>94. The Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon called the
                                Counselor of the Embassy and the Brazilian Ambassador to his office
                                and informed us that he had just received information from Geneva
                                according to which the group of American countries had decided to
                                request that in the Chaco Commission America should be represented
                                by the four limitrophe countries, the five countries which form the
                                Commission of Neutrals, and in addition Venezuela. The group decided
                                also that the League of Nations should extend a special invitation
                                to the United States and Brazil to collaborate with it. According to
                                these reports the commission would be composed of the permanent
                                members of the Council and 6 more which would make a total of 20
                                members. Cruchaga expressed confidence in the action of this
                                commission and believes that it will be able to arrive at a solution
                                of the Chaco question but he considers essential the collaboration
                                of the United States and Brazil without whose presence in the direct
                                negotiations this new attempt he feels would fail. In view of this
                                he has asked me to transmit immediately to the Department the desire
                                of Chile that the United States collaborate actively.</p>
                            <p>Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Brazilian Ambassador
                                evinced considerable fear that Saavedra Lamas, through pique or
                                personal ambition, may attempt in one form or another to impede the
                                labors of the commission. They expressed furthermore their belief
                                that in case the commission decides to sit in a Latin American
                                capital it chooses Montevideo rather than Buenos Aires since in the
                                latter case Saavedra Lamas would undoubtedly be chosen as chairman
                                and this would be viewed with great disfavor by Bolivia.</p>

                            <p>274. This evening the Sixth Committee adopted unanimously a draft
                                resolution on the Chaco matter which will be submitted to the
                                Plenary Assembly probably tomorrow. The draft resolution is divided
                                into three parts. The first part merely enumerates the technical
                                steps leading to the Assembly’s being seized of the dispute. The
                                remainder reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Second Part.</p>
                                    <p>1. Whereas, hostilities have been proceeding in the Chaco for
                                        more than 2 years and all the efforts that have been made to
                                        secure the cessation of hostilities and the pacific
                                        settlement of the dispute have so far proved
                                        ineffectual;</p>
                                    <p>2. And, whereas, in particular, the endeavor made in the
                                        interests of peace prior to the meeting of the Assembly by
                                        the Government of the Argentine Republic with the support of
                                        the Governments of the United States of America and the
                                        United States of Brazil has revealed the difficulties which
                                        still stand in the way of a settlement by conciliation;</p>
                                    <p>3. The Assembly considers that while endeavoring to secure a
                                        settlement of the dispute by the procedure of conciliation
                                        provided for in article 15 paragraph 3 of the Covenant it
                                        should forthwith take steps to prepare the report
                                        contemplated in paragraph 4 of the same article on the
                                        understanding that the conciliation procedure remains open
                                        until such time as the said report shall have been
                                        adopted.</p>
                                    <p>Third part.</p>
                                    <p>4. The Assembly hereby decides to establish a Committee
                                        comprising (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the members of the
                                        Council; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) those members of the
                                        League who not being at present members of the Council have
                                        taken part in the attempts previously made in America as
                                        members of the Washington Committee of Neutrals or as states
                                        bordering on the parties to the dispute, that is to say,
                                        Colombia, Cuba, Peru, and Uruguay; (<hi rend="italic"
                                        >c</hi>) four other members to be selected by the
                                        Assembly.</p>
                                    <p>5. The Committee will be formed without delay. It will settle
                                        its own procedure with a view to discharging its duty as
                                        effectively and speedily as possible. It may secure such
                                        assistance as it may consider necessary.</p>
                                    <p>6. Should it succeed in bringing about the settlement of the
                                        dispute by applying article 15 paragraph 3 of the Covenant
                                        the Committee will make public on behalf of the Assembly a
                                        statement giving facts and explanations regarding the
                                        dispute and the terms of settlement thereof.</p>
                                    <p>7. Should it prove impossible to settle the dispute the
                                        Committee will submit to the Assembly the draft report,
                                        contemplated in article 15 paragraph 4 of the Covenant,
                                        containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the
                                        recommendations concerning the cessation of hostilities, the
                                        settlement of the dispute, and any consequences arising out
                                        of those recommendations in regard to the application of the
                                        prohibition <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0156"/>to supply
                                        arms and war material to which numerous governments have
                                        subscribed in some cases ‘subject to any further
                                        recommendation by the Council of the Assembly.’</p>
                                    <p>8. In accordance with rule 1 paragraph 2 of its rules of
                                        procedure the Assembly will meet in extraordinary session at
                                        the request of the Committee hereby set up.”</p></quote></p>
                            <p>This draft was amended by the addition of a paragraph to the effect
                                that the Sixth Committee recommend to the Assembly to select in
                                accordance with paragraph 4(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) above the
                                following states: China, Ireland, Sweden, and Venezuela.</p>
                            <p>After the approval of this draft resolution the Argentine
                                representative, referring to the last sentence of paragraph 5 above,
                                expressed the hope that inasmuch as the Chaco matter was now in the
                                hands of the League the proposed Committee would invite the United
                                States and Brazil to take part in its work. Chile, Bolivia,
                                Venezuela, Paraguay, and Spain supported this suggestion.</p>
                            <p>It is now contemplated that the Committee envisaged in this draft
                                resolution will hold its first meeting on Friday, September 28.</p>

                            <p>275. The immediate technical situation of the Chaco question before

                                        p.m. awaits Assembly approval.</item>

                                        penultimate paragraph of that telegram await action in some

                            <p>Adoption of the draft resolution by the Assembly appears certain. It
                                is further understood that Madariaga<note n="59" xml:id="d124fn59"
                                    >Representative of Spain on the League Council.</note> will be
                                Chairman of the Committee and that its first meeting will be held on

                            <p>Last evening Avenol and Madariaga jointly stated to me that they
                                construed the procedures in the Sixth Committee cited in my telegram
                                referred to above as in effect an invitation to the United States to
                                participate in the League Chaco Commission. They thus felt justified
                                at this time, and that it was further incumbent on them in view of
                                the changed situation, to ask me to ascertain confidentially and
                                informally whether the United States would participate.</p>
                            <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0157"/>
                            <p>Such reply [as] I may be instructed to make to this inquiry will
                                obviously govern the action of the Committee after its establishment
                                in extending an invitation to the United States.</p>
                            <p>Avenol informed me Brazil was being approached in a similar
                                sense.</p>

                            <p>66. Foreign Minister informed me this afternoon that the League Chaco
                                Commission of 22 countries has been named to include the United
                                States and Brazil, and that the Bolivian delegate at Geneva has
                                expressed to him the thought that if the Assembly unanimously
                                invites the United States to form part perhaps the Department will
                                accept; he also stated that the Bolivian Congress will telegraph
                                Washington requesting such acceptance, and that all Bolivia hopes
                                for it. In his own name the Minister for Foreign Affairs requests me
                                to state that a United States refusal will place Bolivia in a very
                                difficult position since he considers United States participation
                                very important and he wishes the Bolivian request to the United
                                States to be made with the utmost warmth. He pointed out that United
                                States participation in the Leticia conciliation is a precedent.</p>

                                Minister for Foreign Affairs, it is a matter of surprise that the
                                Bolivian Government should still be under the impression that this
                                Government would accept membership in a commission appointed by the
                                League of Nations to deal with the Chaco problem. You should call
                                immediately upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs and state that the
                                decision of this Government in that regard has already been
                                communicated to the Bolivian Government both through you as well as
                                through the Bolivian Minister in Washington.</p>
                            <p>You should further advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his
                                confidential information that in response to an informal inquiry
                                received <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0159"/>from the Secretary
                                General of the League of Nations, the latter was yesterday
                                informally advised by the American Consul in Geneva that while the
                                United States was unable to participate in the proposed League Chaco
                                commission, this Government, acting in its individual capacity would
                                adopt a friendly and cooperative attitude towards the activities of
                                the commission whenever in its own judgment such attitude might
                                prove of practical assistance in furthering the pacific solution of
                                the Chaco problem.</p>
                            <p>You may then add that this Government is sure that the Bolivian
                                Government will recognize the earnest and consistent desire of the
                                United States to assist in the solution of the Chaco problem as has
                                been made peculiarly evident during the past few months by the
                                continued efforts of the United States together with the Governments
                                of Brazil and Argentina to find the grounds for a peaceful solution
                                equally acceptable to Bolivia and to Paraguay and that it was
                                understood from the message received from Dr. Alvesteguí and
                                transmitted in your cable number 63, September 19, 3 p.m.,<note
                                    n="62" xml:id="d130fn62"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_216">p. 216</ref>.</note> that it was the desire
                                of the Government of Bolivia that these negotiations should
                                continue. You may point out that the sole notification received by
                                this Government from the Bolivian Government that the latter
                                considered these negotiations as terminated was that contained in
                                the recent declarations made by the Bolivian delegate to the League
                                of Nations in Geneva. You may then request official confirmation of
                                the fact that the Bolivian Government considers the mediation
                                negotiations in which the United States has participated together
                                with Brazil and Argentina as being terminated.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion you should state that this Government will, of course
                                continue in its individual capacity to cooperate in endeavoring to
                                further the peaceful solution of the Chaco war in every appropriate
                                manner.</p>

                                this Government appreciates highly the friendly message he has sent
                                expressing the hope of the Chilean Government that the United States
                                will collaborate actively in the Chaco commission designated by the
                                League of Nations. You may inform him for his confidential

                            <p>116. For your information, this Government yesterday in response to
                                an informal inquiry received from the Secretary General of the
                                League of Nations as to whether the United States would participate
                                in the League Chaco commission, replied that while the United States
                                was not able to participate in the proposed League Chaco commission
                                this Government, acting in its individual capacity would adopt a
                                friendly and cooperative attitude towards the activities of the
                                commission whenever in its own judgment such attitude might prove of
                                practical assistance in furthering the peaceful solution of the

                            <p>You should communicate the reply made to Dr. Saavedra Lamas and to
                                your Brazilian colleague. The Department yesterday informed the
                                Brazilian Government of the attitude taken in this regard and it
                                understands that the policy of the Brazilian Government will be
                                identical.</p>

                                    printed.</note> The Department received yesterday from the
                                Bolivian Minister a memorandum<note n="63" xml:id="d133fn64">Not

                                which it was stated with regard to the recent declarations of the
                                Bolivian delegate to the League of Nations that “The Bolivian
                                Foreign Office is informed that these statements were made in a
                                manner forced by unexpected circumstances without the delegate
                                having had sufficient time to deliberate regarding his attitude”.
                                The memorandum concludes with an expression of regret that these
                                declarations may have given offense to the Government of the United
                                States “whose honesty and impartiality it is a pleasure to <pb
                                    n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0161"/>acknowledge once more—and
                                proof of which acknowledgment is found in the insistent efforts
                                which the Government of Bolivia is making in order that the United
                                States may form part of whatever body is organized for the purpose
                                of bringing about peace between Bolivia and Paraguay.”</p>
                            <p>You may communicate these statements to the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs who, it is assumed, will receive a similar statement from
                                the Bolivian Government.</p>
                            <p>It would seem premature in view of this … statement on the part of
                                the Bolivian Government to determine upon the course of procedure at
                                this moment. The reported appointment by the League committee of a
                                subcommittee of conciliation composed exclusively of American states
                                and the as yet uncertain attitude of Argentina with regard thereto,
                                makes it highly desirable to await the outcome of these present
                                developments before reaching any final decision as to policy. You
                                may, of course, state to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this
                                Government will consult fully with the Government of Brazil before
                                reaching any determination in this regard.</p>
                            <p>I incline to the views expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                as reported in paragraph 4 of your cable and the arguments advanced
                                in your paragraph 5 have been repeatedly used in our conversations
                                with the Bolivian Minister here.</p>
                            <p>Please cable the Department whether in your judgment, should a
                                subcommittee composed exclusively of American states undertake to
                                hold a conciliation conference with representatives of the two
                                belligerents in Buenos Aires, the Government of Brazil would be
                                disposed to appoint a representative to cooperate in such
                                conciliation endeavors together with the representatives of the
                                other American states forming part of such subcommittee.</p>

                            <p>170. Yesterday I communicated the contents of the Department’s number
                                116, September 28, 3 p.m., to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas read me a telegram he said he had sent to his
                                representatives in Washington and Geneva instructing them that the
                                attitude of the Argentine Government before the League of Nations’
                                Chaco Commission was one of passive observance keeping in mind,
                                however, the loyalty owed to the League and adding that he was
                                convinced <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0162"/>that this
                                Commission’s efforts would fail. The Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                then emphasized to me his conviction that a passive attitude in this
                                connection was the correct one at present awaiting the moment when
                                the matter might again be mature for further peace efforts by the
                                three mediating countries.</p>

                                <item>It is my impression that the Brazilian Government would be
                                    extremely reluctant to modify the attitude it has consistently
                                    maintained and which was confirmed in a message to Bolivia day
                                    before yesterday, reported in my 252, September 29, 3 p.m.,<note
                                        n="65" xml:id="d135fn65">Not printed.</note> in which it
                                    stated “We regret that we cannot accept membership on any
                                    committee organized by the League.”</item>

                                <item>As a practical matter it is not anticipated that the situation
                                    envisaged in the Department’s telegram will arise. According to
                                    reports received from Geneva the subcommittee of American states
                                    will not sit in Buenos Aires but in Geneva. It is not charged
                                    with the duty of holding a conciliation conference but with
                                    making a report to the main committee, and it is felt here that
                                    participation in the work of such a subcommittee would be in no
                                    real sense different from participation on the committee
                                    itself.</item>

                                <item>In case Department’s inquiry was prompted by exchange with
                                    Uruguayan Government, reported in my 247, September 28, 10
                                        a.m.,<note n="65" xml:id="d135fn66">Not printed.</note> I
                                    venture to draw attention to the fact that the Uruguayan
                                    proposal was that the League should withdraw in favor of the
                                    nine countries we ourselves had proposed to handle the question.
                                    The Brazilian Government having assured itself that this was not
                                    to be a proposal that the question would be handled by the
                                    League but merely a restatement of our own intentions, felt
                                    justified in saying that it would offer no objection providing
                                    it was understood that the conference would take place in Buenos
                                    Aires, this in order to put a stop to Uruguayan maneuvers to
                                    secure the conference for Montevideo. I am assured that this
                                    implies no modifications of the Brazilian attitude toward League
                                    activities.</item>

                                    Office this morning, he tells me that the Brazilian Government
                                    has gone definitely on record with the League and with the
                                    Governments of Argentina, Chile and Bolivia, in the sense of the
                                    message to Bolivia referred to in paragraph 1 above, and would
                                    find considerable difficulty in any statement which involved a
                                    reversal of policy.</item>

                                both as to improbability of League conciliation commission sitting
                                in Buenos Aires and as to reasons for acquiescing in Uruguayan
                                proposal. He added that he saw no practical difference between
                                accepting membership on committee or subcommittee and that Brazil
                                had followed a consistent course which had been confirmed in message
                                to Bolivia Saturday and in definite statement made by President
                                Vargas today to Bolivian Minister that Brazil would accept no place
                                on committees organized by the League.</p>

                            <p>255. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expresses himself as perturbed
                                by the League’s activity in the Chaco question, first of all because
                                he fears it threatens the normal development of the system of
                                settling American problems among ourselves.</p>
                            <p>While he recognizes the obligation of the League to take cognizance
                                of the conflict when brought to its attention by a member state, he
                                feels that a sense of reality would have dictated a postponement and
                                    <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0164"/>the exertion of League
                                influence to back up our efforts to secure acceptance of the formula
                                and the cessation of hostilities. If this course had been taken he
                                believes we could have succeeded.</p>
                            <p>Instead of this the League seems to be taking over the whole range of
                                the problem and entrusting its solution to a committee composed
                                arbitrarily of non-American powers—Russia, China, Ireland, Sweden,
                                et cetera. Past experience gives ground for fearing that under such
                                conditions the matter will be handled in a legalistic and oratorical
                                way which is calculated to lose sight of the more realistic aim of
                                stopping the war. Briefly, he feels the interjection of the League
                                can only serve to deter a solution.</p>
                            <p>Comparing past League efforts with purely American efforts, he feels
                                experience has shown that we understand our own problems better than
                                they are understood at Geneva and that we can settle American
                                conflicts better and more expeditiously among ourselves than can be
                                hoped for if duplicate negotiations afford the parties an
                                opportunity to alternate between the two and thus complicate and
                                prolong the discussion, as is being done at the present time.</p>
                            <p>He therefore suggests that you may be willing to give thought to the
                                desirability of some broad statement, speech, or other
                                pronouncement, stressing the importance we attach to settling
                                American problems in America. He recognizes of course that this is
                                both delicate and important but feels that it calls for
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>It is his idea that such a step would be welcome[d] rather than
                                resented by most of the American Republics if the statement brought

                                thought is that at the start the basis of our relations was the
                                Monroe Doctrine<note n="67" xml:id="d137fn67">See section entitled
                                    “Official Statement of and Commentary Upon the Monroe Doctrine

                                as enunciated was of course unilateral—but a unilateral obligation
                                rather than a unilateral assertion of a privileged position for
                                ourselves. It was unilateral because the United States was the only
                                country in this hemisphere able to stand on its own feet at that
                                time. The United States assumed this responsibility as an emergency
                                measure in order to gain time for the newly independent countries to
                                get their growth and in the hope that as time went on other American
                                countries would develop strength to share the responsibility we had
                                assumed for their benefit. This is so obvious that it has perhaps
                                not been stated often enough. However we have spontaneously
                                recognized the fact that others have attained their majority by
                                seeking their help in settling American problems. Experience has
                                shown better results from this method than from any other.</p>
                            <p>From the Brazilian-American point of view the Minister said “so long
                                as Brazil and the United States are not members of the League of <pb
                                    n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0165"/>Nations we should not permit
                                any intervention of non-American states in the handling of purely
                                American problems”. The Minister has not sought to indicate the
                                time, nature, or ostensible occasion for the suggested
                                pronouncement, all would be determined by developments; but the
                                Minister is anxious that you should be turning the general idea over
                                in your mind.</p>
                            <p>It is clear from the sober and measured way in which the Minister
                                talked that this has been the subject of considerable thought and
                                discussion. He kept stressing the view that the present problem is
                                more fundamental than any question of procedure in handling the
                                Chaco problem and raises the question as to whether the Monroe
                                Doctrine is to develop into an all American principle or whether we
                                are going to allow it to be undermined by non-American handling of
                                American affairs.</p>
                            <p>If such a pronouncement is made it would have to be made by the
                                United States but the Minister feels that he could follow it up by a
                                statement of his own, confirming and supporting it.</p>
                            <p>I venture to point out that the foregoing are the views of the
                                Minister uncolored by comments of my own. In view of the importance
                                of his message I have this afternoon gone over this telegram with
                                him in order to make sure that his opinions were accurately
                                reported.</p>
                            <p>He would welcome an expression of your views.</p>

                            <p>256. 1. Paraguayan Minister here today informed Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs under instructions from his Government, that if Brazil and
                                the United States do not participate in the League negotiations
                                Paraguay will withdraw from the League sooner than accept
                                jurisdiction of Chaco Commission.</p>
                            <p>2. The President of Bolivia telegraphed Minister here to make
                                personal appeal to President Vargas for reconsideration of Brazilian
                                stand and acceptance of place on League Chaco Committee. The
                                President has today made it clear to the Minister that the Brazilian
                                Government will not modify its attitude.</p>
                            <p>3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs says that, although the
                                belligerents may not have analyzed their fears, one principal
                                apprehension lies in the thought of a demobilized army returning
                                penniless and unemployed and its accompanying problems. The
                                Brazilian Government <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0166"/>has told
                                the Ministers of Bolivia and Paraguay that as demobilization
                                proceeds Brazil will provide work for a large number of demobilized
                                men on coffee and cotton plantations where there is shortage of
                                labor. He pointed out that this should predispose the two
                                Governments towards peace in that it provides immediate gainful
                                occupation for many thousands of men, lessening the possibility of
                                revolution and providing unexpected income.</p>
                            <p>4. Bolivian Minister has also been told that if in the conciliation
                                conference Bolivia is awarded a port on the Paraguay River south of
                                Bahía Negra Brazil would consent to a Bolivian air service flying
                                over Brazilian territory connecting with nearest railroad, thus
                                gaining rapid access to the Atlantic Ocean. He states Bolivia now
                                has a considerable amount of suitable aviation material to set up
                                such a service.</p>
                            <p>5. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in agreement with the
                                understanding expressed in your 139, September 29, 2 p.m., that it
                                is essential to await developments. In his opinion if we take no
                                action both Bolivia and Paraguay will within a short time get
                                nervous and themselves make overtures. As both are suspicious of the
                                Argentine Republic their pleas will probably be addressed to the
                                United States and Brazil. The Minister’s idea would be to take
                                advantage of the opportunity to impose reasonable terms on both
                                sides without bringing Lamas into the discussions, but, in order
                                that there may be no reason for offense, he suggests that after
                                having secured an agreement to negotiate we should insist that the
                                negotiations take place in Buenos Aires under the presidency of
                                Lamas. Naturally all the foregoing is contingent on developments at
                                Geneva.</p>

                            <p>258. Argentine Ambassador here has received telegram from Lamas dated
                                Saturday night. It states in substance: (1) Lamas is convinced the
                                League Committee of Twenty-two is bound to fail; (2) that it is
                                better for the mediating powers to await developments, and that so
                                long as the League is handling this question the Argentine will play
                                a passive role; (3) that at the present time Brazil and the United
                                States, not being members of the League of Nations, are in a
                                favorable position to resume negotiations with Argentine
                                support.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has told the Argentine Ambassador
                                that he is in agreement as to the general views and that whatever
                                    <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0167"/>might be decided he would

                            <p>69. President of Bolivia returned yesterday afternoon. Foreign
                                Minister informed me this afternoon that on Sunday he received a
                                telegram from the Bolivian Minister at Washington that the latter
                                had talked with Assistant Secretary Welles and the United States
                                Government did not insist upon the question in the Department’s
                                telegram 25, September 28, 3 p.m. Foreign Minister states that he
                                considers tripartite mediation in a pause and that it can be
                                returned to in case of failure by the League.</p>
                            <p>In the telegram of yesterday to the League Secretary the Foreign
                                Minister urged invitation participation United States and Brazil,
                                and appointed the delegate Bolivian plenipotentiary to the
                                Committee.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Minister also commented on the commanded absence from Geneva
                                of the Paraguayan delegate.</p>
                            <p>On Saturday he stated to me that the recent declarations of the
                                Bolivian delegate had been forced by the maneuvers of the Argentine
                                delegate.</p>

                            <p>143. Your 255, October 1, 6 p.m. Please inform the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs that this Government has studied with the deepest
                                interest the suggestion which he has offered. You may say that the
                                views which he has outlined meet with a peculiarly sympathetic
                                response on the part of this Government. It is the belief of the
                                United States as it is of Brazil that American problems can be most
                                advantageously solved through some form of cooperation between the
                                American states themselves and not through the utilization of
                                non-American agencies. This Government, in fact, believes that one
                                of the fundamental needs of the American continent is the creation
                                of a practical and effective American mechanism to be constantly
                                available <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0168"/>when disputes are
                                threatened or break out between members of the American community of
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>This Government is, however, sure the Brazilian Government will agree
                                that any pronouncement of the character indicated by Dr. Macedo
                                Soares if made at this moment would inevitably be construed as an
                                attack upon the League of Nations or as a deliberate reflection upon
                                its general utility. For that reason this Government believes it
                                desirable to take no action now but will however undertake full and
                                detailed consideration of the far-reaching policy suggested by the
                                Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>You may further state that this Government, of course, will gladly
                                avail itself of the opportunity to discuss all phases of the
                                question with the Brazilian Government before reaching any final
                                decision.</p>

                                time being with regard to the mediation negotiations is to await
                                developments in Geneva and to make no further representations either
                                to Bolivia or to Paraguay until this Government can ascertain the
                                course which the League Commission will pursue.</p>

                            <p>144. Your 254, October 1, 6 p.m. This Government has already upon
                                several occasions made known its determined policy not to accept
                                membership on any League committee or subcommittee dealing with the
                                Chaco problem. The inquiry contained in the last paragraph of the
                                Department’s 139, September 29, 2 p.m., was based upon information
                                received that the Uruguayan Government with the probable support of
                                Chile would attempt to persuade the League Commission to appoint a
                                subcommittee composed exclusively of American states to meet in some
                                South American capital to proceed solely with the task of
                                conciliation and that if this plan were adopted, Brazil <pb n="99"
                                    xml:id="pg_99" facs="0169"/>and the United States would be
                                requested to cooperate in this effort through the appointment of
                                representatives to sit with the members of the subcommittee although
                                not as members of the subcommittee itself. In that case, of course,
                                any United States representative would function solely under the
                                jurisdiction of his own Government and would not take part in the
                                drafting of any report to the Commission of the League. This
                                development, however, now seems unlikely. You may, however, advise
                                the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs of the reason for the
                                Department’s inquiry and state that this Government would consult
                                with the Brazilian Government prior to reaching any decision as to
                                its action in such contingency.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Ambassador here yesterday conveyed a message similar to
                                that communicated to the Brazilian Government and communicated in
                                your 258, October 2, 5 p.m. The Department made a reply similar to
                                that made by the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs. This
                                Government believes that at the present time the best policy to
                                pursue is to await developments and to ascertain specifically what
                                action Bolivia and Paraguay will take in Geneva. The American Consul
                                in Geneva reports this morning<note n="69" xml:id="d143fn69"
                                    >Telegram No. 286, October 2, 9 p.m., from the Consul at Geneva,
                                    not printed.</note> that the Bolivian Government has designated
                                Costa du Rels as Bolivian plenipoteniary on the Committee and
                                Subcommittee and has at the same time expressed the desire that the
                                United States and Brazil be invited to participate. Paraguay has
                                sent a reply to the League Commission’s invitation reiterating its
                                former stand that a cessation of hostilities with adequate security
                                is a necessary preliminary to any efforts of conciliation but that
                                it is willing to examine the possibility of mediation on the basis
                                of the foregoing. The Subcommittee has addressed a telegram to the
                                Paraguayan Government calling attention to the fact that there is no
                                Paraguayan representative in Geneva; taking note of the Paraguayan
                                declaration made and stating that the Subcommittee is awaiting the
                                decision of the Paraguayan Government. The members of the
                                Subcommittee are leaving Geneva subject to call upon the receipt of
                                a pertinent communication from Paraguay. In view of the situation
                                which has thus developed there would seem to be little probability
                                of League success in conciliation unless the attitude of the
                                Paraguayan Government changes.</p>

                            <p>Last night in an informal conversation with President Ayala he said
                                that the League of Nations had asked Paraguay to explain the
                                conditions of security she has asked as a condition of the cessation
                                of hostilities. The President said the Paraguayan Government would
                                reply today that it is prepared to appoint a plenipotentiary to
                                appear before the League subcommittee with the object exclusively of
                                arranging for the immediate cessation of hostilities, with a plan of
                                security for maintaining peace, a reduction on the armies and a
                                limitation upon the purchase of war materials. And also stipulations
                                for a system of policing the zone of occupation by each country and
                                a pact of non-aggression under international guaranty. Following an
                                agreement upon these points Paraguay would be prepared to discuss
                                questions of conciliation.</p>

                            <p>262. This morning Calvo the Bolivian Minister (former Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs) called on me for a general talk. He was chiefly
                                interested in eliciting a definite statement as to our attitude
                                toward accepting membership on League commissions. I told him our
                                position as outlined in the Department’s telegrams, and in my turn
                                asked him how in the face of our repeated statements of our position
                                Costa du Rels could feel justified in continuing to state that he
                                believed the United States and Brazil could be persuaded to modify
                                their attitude. Doctor Calvo said the Bolivian Government had
                                already addressed that question to Du Rels, who had replied that he
                                had “definite assurances from Americans in Geneva not members of the
                                Consulate or Legation”.</p>
                            <p>If Costa du Rels is acting on the basis of this sort of information
                                Department may want to have the facts made plain to him.</p>

                            <p>301. Avenol asked me to come to see him today and showed me in
                                confidence a telegram from the Bolivian Government to the Bolivian
                                representative here which the latter had transmitted to him
                                privately for his information. The text of the telegram is
                                substantially as follows:</p>
                            <p>The United States Government has recently made a <hi rend="italic"
                                    >démarche</hi> at La Paz to the effect that, understanding that
                                the conciliation efforts at Geneva respecting the Chaco were
                                unsuccessful, some attempt should be made in America to arrive at
                                conciliation before the issuance of the Assembly report at the end
                                of November.</p>
                            <p>I estimate the situation here to be that Bolivia’s policy at least in
                                part is to place herself in as favorable a light as possible before
                                the League in the hope of obtaining either through the Assembly
                                report or as a result of that report a lifting of the embargo either
                                respecting both parties or respecting herself.</p>

                            <p>105. Your 301, October 24, noon, second paragraph. You may inform
                                Avenol orally that this Government has made no <hi rend="italic"
                                    >démarche</hi> at La Paz or elsewhere in the sense reported. The
                                facts are that the Bolivian Minister recently inquired what the
                                United States proposed to do with regard to resuming mediation
                                negotiations; he was informed that the negotiations in which we had
                                been engaged were temporarily suspended; that our position was
                                exactly what it had always been, namely, that we stood ready to be
                                helpful whenever in our judgment an appropriate opportunity was
                                presented if the two belligerents desired such help, but that we
                                certainly could take no steps on our own initiative until both
                                Bolivia and Paraguay desired such assistance. The Minister said that
                                he was going to send a cable to his Government stating that a
                                resumption of mediation negotiations would in no way be incompatible
                                with the situation at Geneva.</p>

                            <p>2. Last evening Avenol and Osusky jointly formally handed me the text
                                of the resolution. I fully appreciate the character of this action
                                on their part: it was solely informative and is not to be regarded
                                in any sense as an invitation.</p>
                            <p>They have not as yet decided how [to] act on this mandate of the
                                committee.</p>
                            <p>The impression they left with me was that they were hesitant and
                                somewhat embarrassed in the face of position previously expressed
                                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0173"/>by Washington how to
                                carry out the intent of the committee, that if possible they obtain
                                American cooperation. They stated that they would communicate with
                                me again shortly.</p>
                            <p>I personally construe their handing me the resolution unaccompanied
                                by any request or suggestion to be that it is in the hope that I
                                might be instructed to give them advice which by application would
                                suggest the course they might best follow or obviate their taking
                                action. The Department may wish to consider this with a view to
                                forestalling protracted speculation here and in the press.</p>
                            <p>3. Avenol and Osusky told me that Madariaga’s proposal came as a
                                complete surprise to them and they believed to almost all of the
                                Committee.</p>
                            <p>My personal estimate of the situation is that Avenol and Osusky and
                                perhaps certain European representatives would have opposed
                                approaching the United States and Brazil in this sense at this time
                                but in view of the support accorded this idea on the part of certain
                                Latin American representatives they did not wish to place themselves
                                in absolute opposition to these representatives in a Latin American
                                matter. Thus the resolution which was adopted was a compromise
                                within the terms of which there is considerable latitude respecting
                                the action to be taken.</p>
                            <p>4. The Committee of Twenty-two will continue its sessions here until
                                the convening of the Extraordinary Assembly on November 20.</p>

                                    the moment of its formation attached great importance to the

                                of the League addressed a letter to the American Consul advising him
                                of the adoption of the resolution and stating that in view of its
                                terms the President of the Chaco Committee and himself would greatly
                                appreciate any information as to the views of this Government
                                concerning “the most opportune moment and most suitable form which
                                might be found for the collaboration which is so keenly desired by
                                the Committee.”</p>

                                earliest possible moment and say that this Government would welcome
                                the views of the Brazilian Government regarding the request received
                                from the Secretary General of the League which it assumes has been
                                made in identical form to the representative of Brazil in Geneva.
                                You may further state that in the opinion of this Government there
                                would not seem to be any effective means for collaboration by the
                                United States with the Chaco Committee in its efforts for
                                conciliation in view of the short time elapsing before the convening
                                of the Extraordinary Assembly on November 20 even should the United
                                States desire to collaborate with the Chaco Committee. Furthermore,
                                in view of the fact that this Government has been confidentially
                                advised that certain of the European powers will propose drastic
                                action with regard to Bolivia and Paraguay during the sessions of
                                the Extraordinary Assembly, the impression created by the
                                consistently friendly and impartial attitude displayed by both
                                Brazil and the United States with respect to the two belligerents
                                might be jeopardized were our two Governments to be identified with
                                League efforts at a moment when an acrimonious debate involving the
                                two belligerents may take place in Geneva which might readily incur
                                the resentment of and injure the susceptibilities of both of the two
                                nations involved in the Chaco conflict. Consequently, this
                                Government has determined, in replying to the request of the
                                Secretary General of the League, to limit itself to an expression of
                                appreciation for the friendly tenor of the message; to reiterate the
                                position which the United States has officially and publicly assumed
                                with regard to cooperation with any and all agencies endeavoring to
                                further a peaceful solution of the Chaco dispute; and finally, to
                                state that while the United States, under the circumstances now
                                existing, does not deem this particular moment opportune for
                                collaboration with the League Committee, nevertheless, it will give
                                the invitation conveyed its favorable consideration and should in

                                <p>“Geneva, Switzerland, November 15, 1934.</p>
                                <p>My dear Mr. Avenol: In response to your letter which you
                                    addressed me under date of November 13, 1934, and in which you
                                    courteously drew my attention to the resolution adopted on
                                    November 12 by the Assembly Committee on the dispute between
                                    Bolivia and Paraguay I am instructed to express to you the
                                    appreciation of my Government for your message.</p>
                                <p>As I have informed you personally in the course of our recent
                                    conversations the Secretary of State has on various occasions
                                    made clear that the United States of America has stood ready and
                                    stands ready to contribute in any feasible way to the efforts of
                                    any agency engaged in the promotion of peace, acting on its
                                    independent judgment as the exigencies of each case may suggest.
                                    This is a policy which I feel it scarcely necessary to add has
                                    been demonstrated on a number of occasions in the relationship
                                    of the Government of the United States to the efforts of various
                                    peace agencies which have concerned themselves with the
                                    unfortunate situation in the Chaco.</p>
                                <p>In pursuance of this policy my Government has adopted a friendly
                                    attitude toward the League Committee which now has this question
                                    before it. My Government does not, however, under the
                                    circumstances now existing deem this particular moment as
                                    opportune for collaboration with that Committee. It will,
                                    however, give the communication you have addressed me its
                                    favorable consideration and, should in the future a time arrive
                                    when in the opinion of my Government its cooperation with the
                                    League endeavors in this respect would appear to prove useful in
                                    the furtherance of peace in the Chaco, I shall so inform you and
                                    at the same time indicate the form in which the cooperation of
                                    the United States of America may be offered.</p>
                                <p>I am, my dear Mr. Avenol, very sincerely yours. Prentiss

                            <p>318. Department’s 169, November 14, 2 p.m. Due to the national
                                holiday yesterday Minister for Foreign Affairs was not accessible
                                until early this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>He stated that the Brazilian Minister to Switzerland had only just
                                received from the Secretary General of the League a written request
                                similar to the one addressed to us.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs further stated that the views of the
                                Brazilian Government concurred with those of our Government as set
                                forth in your telegram with the following exception: With regard to
                                the final clause in our answer to the League stating that if a time
                                should come in the future when in our opinion we could usefully
                                cooperate with the League Committee we would so inform the Secretary
                                General. The Minister said he realized that this did not commit us
                                to such cooperation: However, in accordance with his consistent
                                attitude (e. g. Embassy’s 254, October 1, 6 p.m.) he felt that an
                                answer couched in these terms would not clearly enough assert the
                                principle that cooperation with a League Committee under any
                                conditions would be impossible for Brazil as a nonmember of the
                                League.</p>
                            <p>He proposed, therefore, to conclude his answer with a statement to
                                the effect that if in the future a time should come when Brazil
                                would feel that she could usefully take “parallel action” in
                                furtherance of peace in the Chaco she would so inform the Secretary
                                General.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs further told me (requesting that you
                                treat it as absolutely confidential) that he proposed sending a
                                personal telegram to “his great friend,” Harold Butler of the
                                International Labor Bureau, setting forth to him informally for such
                                use as he could make of it the Minister’s views, including his
                                belief that mediatory efforts initiated by Brazil and the United
                                States offered the best hope of effective results. To his mind the
                                League is doomed to failure in its present Chaco efforts and will
                                have a very awkward time finding a formula to conceal such failure
                                so that a suggestion of this kind might be developed into something
                                in the nature of a face saver and likewise bring about a quicker
                                resumption of more effective efforts; if the League should
                                eventually express the hope that the United States and Brazil would
                                resume the initiative of further mediatory efforts this would
                                necessarily mean that the Argentine would be asked by us both to
                                collaborate.</p>
                            <p>I was somewhat astonished at this, to me, entirely new departure, and
                                indicated that this seemed to be quite a step in advance, to which
                                    <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0178"/>the Minister replied
                                that the proposed telegram would be purely private and personal with
                                a view to finding as quickly as possible a way out of what he deems
                                the present impasse. He promised to give me a copy of the telegram
                                as soon as it has been sent.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion the Minister requested me to reiterate to you that as
                                heretofore the Brazilian Government is extremely desirous of
                                continuing to work in complete harmony with us in this matter, and
                                asks to be advised concerning all developments.</p>

                                expected to be delivered today.</p>
                            <p>The following telegram was sent last night to the Brazilian Minister
                                to Switzerland to be delivered to Butler: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“I request you to remind Avenol of the disadvantage of taking
                                        drastic measures against Paraguay and Bolivia without the
                                        League having first tried to obtain peace in the Chaco by
                                        the temporary suspension of the activities of the Committee
                                        in order to permit the League to invite the United States
                                        and Brazil to take such initiative as they may judge
                                        opportune for the reestablishment of peace, the League
                                        taking this occasion to announce that it will give its
                                        entire support to the action of the United States and
                                        Brazil.”</p>

                            <p>The Brazilian Minister to Switzerland was requested, in case Butler
                                should not be in Geneva, to have the International Labor Bureau
                                forward the telegram to him on the understanding that it is a
                                strictly personal confidential communication.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately this telegram was sent without first ascertaining
                                whether Butler is in Geneva and if not where he is at the present
                                moment. The Foreign Office hopes however that the Brazilian Minister
                                in Switzerland can arrange for its repetition to Butler without a
                                leak.</p>
                            <p>Replying to my renewed expressions of doubt the Secretary-General
                                today, in amplifying the motives for the decision of the Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs to take this step, said that if sentiment in
                                Geneva was as the Minister thought it to be he felt that a
                                suggestion of this kind might be acceptable as enabling the League
                                to put the matter back into channels capable of more active
                                mediation efforts and thus avoiding what might in effect be a flat

                                any solution. As explained yesterday, the Minister also felt that if
                                such a suggestion found any favor it would <pb n="109"

                                indefinitely in Geneva and bring them to a head more quickly.</p>
                            <p>The Minister informed me that the Argentine Ambassador here has now
                                received authorization to be present with the American and Brazilian
                                representatives at direct conversations between the Paraguayan and
                                Bolivian Ministers here if and when they may eventually take place.
                                Part of the Minister’s thought in his suggestion to Butler was that
                                if the suggestions were acted upon in any form a channel for the
                                immediate resumption of mediation efforts would thus be at hand in
                                the shape of such direct conversations.</p>

                            <p>321. My 320, November 17, 2 p.m. Foreign Minister informed me
                                yesterday that Butler sailed from New York on the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Berengaria</hi> last night. The Minister did not share my
                                apprehension as to the possibilities of a leak, but he did assure me
                                that there would be no attempt to convey his message to Butler by
                                radio to the ship.</p>
                            <p>I again expressed my view that this move was fraught with potentially
                                far reaching consequences, but the Minister clearly was not
                                perturbed thereat.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps I am unduly concerned myself and this may be due to the fact
                                that such knowledge as I have been able to acquire of the Chaco
                                situation has hitherto necessarily been mainly from documentary
                                study. It is true that the Minister yesterday reiterated that if any
                                concrete basis for agreement between Bolivia and Paraguay were
                                reached either as a result of direct conversations between the
                                representatives of those two Governments here, or of any other
                                mediation efforts consequent upon the League’s desistance, the
                                conciliation conference in expanded form would take place in Buenos
                                Aires (see Department’s 151, October 9, 5 p.m.,<note n="75"

                                Likewise, he may feel that he could, in case of necessity, interpret
                                this move as not differing substantially from the Argentine position
                                outlined in the Embassy’s 258, October 2, 5 p.m. Nevertheless, it
                                seems to me at least a question whether this step does not represent
                                a strengthened desire to decrease the influence of Lamas in
                                connection with any mediation efforts which might result in creating
                                a substantial foundation for an eventual conference in Buenos Aires.
                                    <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0180"/>In other ways also the
                                present move appears to me to be one of an unusual nature for the
                                Brazilian Government inasmuch as it risks being construed as an
                                attempt to speak for us, and the dangers of its becoming a matter of
                                public knowledge are patent.</p>
                            <p>I should very much appreciate the Department’s guiding comment in the
                                premises.</p>

                                see him this evening and raised the following points with me
                                respecting the report of Assembly Chaco Committee.</p>
                            <p>1. He inquired whether the United States might not be able to express
                                some approval or perhaps indorsement of the report.</p>
                            <p>I replied that I had no knowledge as to Washington’s opinion or
                                position respecting the report but that in any event I doubted the
                                expediency of the United States taking any position while League
                                action was still pending—in other words, before action by the
                                Extraordinary Assembly.</p>
                            <p>2. He then took up the provision in the report as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“XII. A Neutral Supervisory Commission shall be set up
                                        consisting of six members designated by the Argentine,
                                        Chile, Peru, Uruguay … respectively.”<note n="78"

                            <p>It will be noted that this leaves the Assembly to take action
                                respecting the completion of the composition of the Neutral
                                Supervisory Commission.</p>
                            <p>Avenol stated that he would prefer that the Assembly complete this
                                provision by adopting a formula under which participation or
                                cooperation by the United States and Brazil might be sought but
                                under which if one or both indicated unwillingness to participate
                                the participation of other states could later be arranged for. He
                                stated, however, that there were delegates to the Assembly who might
                                insist on no change in the terms of this paragraph which would mean
                                that the Assembly would have to act definitely to complete the full
                                six members of the Commission.</p>
                            <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0181"/>
                            <p>Avenol expressed the hope that Washington could indicate its attitude
                                in this respect in such a manner that he could confidentially employ
                                it to guide Assembly action along the most desirable lines.</p>
                            <p>3. Avenol discussed the contemplated peace negotiations at Buenos
                                Aires and stated that it would be helpful for him to know if the
                                United States would be inclined to participate.</p>
                            <p>4. He spoke in the same terms concerning the Advisory Committee.</p>
                            <p>5. Respecting questions raised in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, I stated
                                that I did not feel that these were urgent but that I would forward
                                his inquiry.</p>

                            <p>173. Your 321, November 19, 6 p.m. In view of the reply recently
                                addressed by this Government to the Secretary General of the League
                                of Nations, it does not seem probable that the action proposed by
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs will create the impression in
                                Geneva that the Brazilian Government is attempting to speak for the
                                United States. Should any misunderstanding in Geneva result,
                                however, the Department will take the steps necessary to make clear
                                that the Brazilian initiative was taken without prior consultation
                                with the United States and that the position of this Government
                                remains that manifested in the last communication addressed to the
                                Secretary General of the League. It is desirable that you do not
                                discuss this question at this moment with the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs.</p>

                            <p>341. Avenol this afternoon expressed himself to me as follows:</p>
                            <p>He is somewhat disturbed by press reports from Rio de Janeiro to the
                                effect that Paraguay would refuse the report but more in particular
                                that Asunción had declared League efforts to be a failure and <pb
                                    n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0182"/>that she would turn to
                                “American mediation”. While he expects that in any event Paraguay
                                would be slow in accepting the report he foresees a pretext for
                                delay in this alleged appeal for American mediation. He feels that
                                could this pretext, if possible, be taken from them at this
                                particular juncture it would be most helpful. He thus has
                                preoccupations whether Washington would consider taking action
                                either privately or publicly with the two governments as in a
                                somewhat similar situation in the Leticia matter (Department’s press

                            <p>121. Your 334, November 19, 9 p.m. The Department shares your views
                                that it is decidedly inexpedient for the United States to express
                                any opinions regarding the report of the Chaco Committee at this
                                time. In your discretion you may orally and informally state to
                                Avenol that the position of this Government has been made very clear
                                upon repeated occasions and that in general the United States would
                                be disposed to view favorably any proposals that in its judgment
                                might seem calculated to further peace in the Chaco; but that this
                                Government is unable to assume any definite position until tangible,
                                concrete, and official proposals are presented to it. In such event,
                                the Government of the United States will determine its attitude with
                                regard to each specific proposal in accordance with the merits of
                                such proposal and taking into consideration the conditions which
                                exist at that time.</p>
                            <p>In reply to the inquiry contained in paragraph 6 of your cable under
                                reference, receipt by wireless was satisfactory.</p>

                            <p>325. Department’s 173, November 21, 5 p.m. In the course of a
                                conversation on other matters with the Secretary General of the
                                Foreign Office yesterday evening he volunteered the following
                                information:</p>
                            <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0183"/>
                            <p>Bolivian Minister here had just called on Foreign Minister and had
                                appeared quite sanguine as to Bolivia having acquired a much
                                stronger tactical position through Paraguay’s action concerning the
                                Chaco report.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister then outlined the solution which he thought the
                                League might adopt if Paraguay refused to accept League plan
                                whereupon the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that no solution
                                which might be reached without the participation of one of the
                                parties in conflict could put a final stop to hostilities. The
                                Foreign Minister then said that in his view the best hope of
                                definite and final solution lay in procedure of the nature reported
                                in my 318, November 16, 6 p.m., and my 320, November 17, 2 p.m.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary General said that the Bolivian Minister appeared to
                                acquiesce in this idea and stated that he would report the
                                suggestion sympathetically to his Government. The Secretary General
                                concluded by saying that the Foreign Office also felt that Paraguay
                                would recognize that procedure of this nature would offer the best
                                prospects.</p>
                            <p>In view of the Department’s instructions referred to above I
                                refrained from any disclaimer or comment of any kind.</p>

                                        the Governments of the United States of America and the
                                        United States of Brazil to collaborate in its work in the
                                        manner which they shall consider the most appropriate.</p>

                                    <p>I need not say that the Advisory Committee attaches great
                                        importance to the cooperation of your Government in its work
                                        and earnestly hopes that it will be able to accept this

                            <p>176. In accordance with recommendations adopted by the Assembly of
                                the League of Nations, this Government has received two invitations
                                transmitted by the Secretary General of the League through the
                                American Consul in Geneva, the first requesting the United States to
                                participate in the deliberations of an Advisory Committee whose seat
                                shall be at Geneva, and the second requesting the United States to
                                appoint a representative to take part in the duties of a so-called
                                “Neutral Supervisory Commission” to deal with the purely military
                                aspects involved in the proposed cessation of hostilities between
                                Bolivia and Paraguay and in the taking of measures necessary to
                                assure <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0185"/>the neutrality of a
                                security zone between the military forces of the two
                                belligerents.</p>
                            <p>After very careful consideration this Government contemplates sending
                                the following replies to these two invitations:</p>
                            <p>[Here follow texts of replies transmitted to the Consul at Geneva in
                                (1) telegram No. 126, December 6, 6 p.m., printed on <ref
                                    target="#pg_125">page 125</ref>; (2) telegram No. 125, December
                                6, 5 p.m., printed on <ref target="#pg_124">page 124</ref>.]</p>
                            <p>The reference made in the second of these replies to the peace
                                conference at Buenos Aires has to do with that portion of the
                                recommendation of the League which provides for the holding of a
                                conference of representative[s] of American States to meet at Buenos
                                Aires within 1 month of the date of cessation of hostilities for the
                                purpose of assisting the belligerents in concluding a treaty of
                                peace based upon (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) “the final delimitation
                                of the frontier between the two countries; (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) security clauses; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) economic
                                clauses.” The conference would be limited to the American republics
                                and would be invited by the Argentine President; the period fixed
                                for its labors would be limited to a period not to exceed 2 months
                                and in the event that the conference should not succeed, the two
                                belligerents would be bound to call upon the Permanent Court of
                                International Justice to give judgment in accordance with the
                                provisions which they shall previously have agreed upon in
                                accordance with the terms of the report of the League.</p>
                            <p>At the earliest opportunity after receipt of this cable you should
                                obtain an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and say to
                                him orally on behalf of your Government that the United States,
                                which deeply appreciates the very close and friendly cooperation
                                between our two Governments, does not desire to send these replies
                                to the League without first communicating their contents to the
                                Brazilian Government and being afforded an opportunity of discussing
                                the policy therein envisaged in the frankest manner with the
                                Government of Brazil. You should thereupon read to him the texts of
                                the proposed replies.</p>
                            <p>You should further state that in the judgment of this Government,
                                while it would unquestionably be desirable that all inter-American
                                disputes be adjusted by purely American peace agencies, the time has
                                not yet come when efficient machinery is functioning nor have the
                                peace agencies created by common agreement between the American
                                nations so far acquired sufficient prestige to prove their
                                usefulness at this juncture. Frequently the peace efforts of the
                                American nations during the years of the continuation of the Chaco
                                dispute have broken down as the result of disagreement between the
                                American mediating nations. Except for Brazil and the United States,
                                the present report of the League provides the first occasion upon
                                which all of the American republics have officially agreed upon a
                                formal recommendation for <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0186"
                                />the settlement of the dispute. Because of the special
                                circumstances existing, this Government believes that were the
                                United States to appear to adopt an attitude of passive opposition
                                and refuse its cooperation so far as it is able to offer it in view
                                of its non-membership in the League, the blame for the possible
                                failure of the League efforts or for the refusal of Bolivia or
                                Paraguay to agree to the terms of the report would in certain
                                quarters be placed upon the United States.</p>
                            <p>This is a practical possibility which the United States desires to
                                avoid. But more important than that, the United States believes that
                                its moral support should be consistently offered as it has publicly
                                stated to all peace movements on this continent which appear to hold
                                the promise of achieving their objective. While the United States is
                                not willing to take part in any committee which is constituted to
                                sit in Geneva and which is responsive solely to the necessities of
                                the League organization, it nevertheless believes that by
                                participating in the manner indicated in the Neutral Supervisory
                                Commission and in the proposed peace conference in Buenos Aires, it
                                might be of assistance in the common peace objective of the American
                                nations, particularly since both the Neutral Supervisory Commission
                                and the peace conference in Buenos Aires would be composed
                                exclusively of American States operating on American territory.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion you should state that were the Brazilian Government to
                                share the views expressed by the United States and to take similar
                                or parallel action, it is believed that should this present effort
                                fail, both Brazil and the United States would be in a stronger
                                position subsequently to exert their efforts for peace and at an
                                appropriate moment to lead the way together with other American
                                nations in proposing the formulation of peace machinery on this
                                continent which would always be adequate in the event that the peace
                                of this hemisphere was threatened.</p>
                            <p>Similar views to those expressed above have been made in full detail
                                to the Brazilian Ambassador in Washington who is communicating with
                                his Government.</p>
                            <p>It is of the utmost importance that the views of the Brazilian
                                Government be communicated to the Department at the earliest
                                possible opportunity in order that our official and public reply to
                                the League invitations may not be unduly delayed. It is the earnest
                                hope of this Government that the views of Brazil and of the United
                                States may coincide on this occasion as they have to such great
                                common advantage throughout the Chaco negotiations.</p>

                            <p>328. Department’s 176, December 1, 3 p.m. Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs stated this morning that the view of the Brazilian
                                Government was that its reply to the invitations of the League of
                                Nations should be similar to ours as regards non-participation in
                                the deliberations of the Advisory Committee and as regards
                                participation in the Buenos Aires conference. As regards
                                participation in the labors of the Neutral Supervisory Commission,
                                Brazil feels that in view of its geographical position, contiguous
                                to the belligerents, it is in an entirely different situation from
                                ourselves and therefore that in appointing a representative upon
                                this Commission he must be given full powers and not be subject to
                                the limitations as we propose to impose upon our
                                representatives.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister pointed out that as a result of the schedule of
                                time limits set forth by the League Report and the statements on the
                                part of Paraguay and Bolivia as to when their answers might be
                                expected, hostilities would still be continuing throughout this
                                month, if not longer. His Government, therefore, felt that a
                                determined effort should be made to secure the consent of Bolivia
                                and Paraguay to the immediate cessation of hostilities in return for
                                Brazil’s agreement to participate in the League peace plan. If this
                                could be brought about it would constitute such an important new
                                factor, altering the situation as it had hitherto existed, that
                                Brazil would be justified in departing from her former consistently
                                maintained policy of non-cooperation with League agencies.
                                Accordingly, the Foreign Minister has sounded out the Bolivian and
                                Paraguayan Ministers here both of whom today promised to recommend
                                strongly to their respective Governments that this proposal be
                                accepted. The Secretary-General of the Foreign Office also’ informed
                                me that the Brazilian representatives in La Paz and Asunción have
                                been instructed to endeavor immediately to obtain affirmative
                                replies to this proposal.</p>
                            <p>The Minister stated that Paraguay could not consistently refuse to
                                accede to this proposal and that he also had ground for believing
                                that Bolivia would prove amenable.</p>
                            <p>The Minister, of course, only spoke for Brazil when making his
                                proposal. If, however, the United States were disposed similarly to
                                suggest to Bolivia and Paraguay immediate cessation of hostilities
                                in return for American participation at Buenos Aires and in the work
                                    <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0188"/>of the Neutral
                                Supervisory Commission, the Foreign Minister would be much
                                gratified. In any event, he wished definitely to request that our
                                replies to the League invitations be held up until he received
                                replies from La Paz and Asunción to his proposal, which he is
                                confident will be within 2, or at the most, 3 days.</p>
                            <p>Will the Department therefore instruct me at its early convenience in
                                the premises.</p>
                            <p>The Minister showed me the telegram which he sent Aranha<note n="81"
                                    xml:id="d164fn81">Oswaldo Aranha, Brazilian Ambassador to the
                                    United States.</note> last Saturday which clearly indicates the
                                importance his Government attaches to the immediate cessation of
                                hostilities as a new fact justifying the reversal of policy which
                                Brazil is now prepared to’ consider.</p>
                            <p>I pointed out to the Minister this afternoon that there was nothing
                                in the tenor of my instructions as I conveyed them to him this
                                morning indicating that we had any idea of interrupting our further
                                collaboration with League agencies upon the cessation of
                                hostilities. The Minister consequently did not formally request us
                                to take similar action but merely stated as set forth above how
                                gratified he would be if we should see our way clear to do so.</p>
                            <p>I also stated to the Minister that in my opinion if Bolivia and
                                Paraguay should agree to his proposal for an immediate cessation of
                                hostilities on the express condition that Brazil cooperate with
                                League peace agencies, that would be tantamount to acceptance by the
                                two belligerents of the whole League plan; as both countries had
                                indicated that they would not be able to give their answer on the
                                League Report until a good many days hence, I did not quite
                                understand how he felt so sanguine as to getting an immediate and
                                favorable reply to his proposal. The Minister said that he agreed as
                                to the effect of an acceptance of his proposal but he still felt
                                that this acceptance could be obtained in short order with the
                                result that Brazil and America would be leading the way to
                                peace.</p>
                            <p>In explaining his optimism, the Foreign Minister stated that both the
                                Paraguayan and Bolivian Ministers had not only promised, as
                                indicated above, to recommend acceptance of his proposal, but also
                                had told him this afternoon that they considered the chances of it
                                being accepted in their respective countries were very good. In
                                addition, the Minister also showed me necessarily in strictest
                                confidence a short memorandum from the Bolivian Minister stating
                                that if Brazil and the United States agree for an immediate
                                cessation of hostilities as the condition precedent to their
                                collaboration in the League peace plan he had good reason to believe
                                his Government would accept it. Of course this was only the personal
                                opinion of the Bolivian Minister and he may well have been exceeding
                                his instructions in some of his conversations with the Foreign
                                Minister.</p>
                            <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0189"/>
                            <p>In connection with the general discussion reported in the first part
                                of this telegram the Secretary General made the statement that his
                                Government very much wished that we could see our way to conferring
                                full powers upon our representative on the Neutral Supervisory
                                Commission.</p>

                            <p>177. Your 328, December 3, 7 p.m. You may inform the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs that this Government is deeply gratified to learn
                                that the views of the Brazilian Government with regard to the
                                invitation of the League of Nations are so nearly identical to those
                                held by the United States. You may further say that in deference to
                                the desire expressed by the Foreign Minister, this Government will
                                be glad to withhold its official reply to the League invitation
                                until the latter part of this week with the hope that this action
                                may be conducive to a successful termination of the negotiations
                                which the foreign Minister is conducting with Paraguay and Bolivia.
                                This Government, however, does not feel that it should withhold its
                                official reply for any additional period in view of the mistaken
                                conjectures which such postponement might give rise to.</p>
                            <p>This Government further fully appreciates the fact that the situation
                                of Brazil as a country contiguous to the belligerents is dissimilar
                                to that of the United States and that for that reason the Brazilian
                                representative appointed to the Neutral Supervisory Commission would
                                be given full powers. The United States, however, in view of its
                                individual position, and because of the fact that the Commission
                                might at certain times be subject to the jurisdiction of the
                                Assembly of the League, does not feel able to alter its decision
                                that its own representative should be without vote and without
                                powers to commit this Government except after specific
                                instruction.</p>
                            <p>Aranha, in conversation here, has intimated very strongly that he
                                opposes the Foreign Minister’s negotiations through the Bolivian and
                                Paraguayan Ministers in Rio. He has sent an urgent cable requesting
                                him to desist from a continuation of these negotiations and
                                recommending that the Brazilian Government adopt an attitude similar
                                to that of the United States.</p>
                            <p>For your own guidance, this Government is not inclined to predicate
                                its acceptance of the League invitation upon immediate cessation of
                                hostilities by the belligerents. The League proposal presupposes
                                cessation of hostilities under the regulation of the Neutral
                                Supervisory <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0190"/>Commission and
                                in view of the existing military situation, it would seem highly
                                improbable that Paraguay, even if it accepts the League proposal,
                                will agree to this further condition now sought by Brazil.
                                Consequently, this Government stands on the decisions already
                                communicated to you and will transmit its official replies to Geneva
                                without modification at the time indicated above. You will be
                                advised by cable as soon as the replies are cabled to Geneva.</p>

                            <p>329. My 328, December 3, 7 p.m. last paragraph. The Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs confirmed the statement made by the Secretary
                                General emphasizing his opinion that if both the American and
                                Brazilian representatives on the Neutral Supervisory Commission were
                                given full powers the situation entrusted to this Commission would
                                be much easier to control.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday the Foreign Minister and the Secretary General had been
                                somewhat non-committal as to Brazil’s probable course of action
                                should her confidential <hi rend="italic">démarches</hi> in Bolivia
                                and Paraguay not result favorably. I brought the point up again by
                                saying that as this <hi rend="italic">démarche</hi> was a
                                confidential and individual one on the part of Brazil alone even if
                                its outcome should contrary to the Minister’s hope and expectation
                                prove unfavorable I assumed that Brazil would not consider that she
                                would then be definitely precluded from cooperating with League
                                peace agencies but that if she felt that her larger interests lay in
                                that direction would still be open for such cooperation.</p>
                            <p>The Minister replied that this was the case but that he felt even
                                more confident than yesterday afternoon that his proposal would be
                                accepted by both Bolivia and Paraguay. He has a telegram from the
                                Minister at La Paz which while not final indicates that a definitely
                                favorable reply from the Bolivian Government may be expected during
                                the course of today.</p>
                            <p>Aranha’s telegram of yesterday was shown me by the Foreign Minister
                                who expressed regret that you did not share his (the Foreign
                                Minister’s) views as to the feasibility of securing the agreement of
                                both belligerents to an immediate cessation of hostilities and as to
                                this constituting the “new fact” of capital importance. He concluded
                                by saying that although Brazil alone had taken the risk in this <hi
                                    rend="italic">démarche</hi> if, as he had more than ever reason
                                to believe, its outcome proved satisfactory <pb n="121"
                                    xml:id="pg_121" facs="0191"/>he would be more than glad to share
                                the benefit thereof with the United States: and he firmly hoped that
                                if such a solution were now to be attained the United States in
                                replying to the League invitations would join Brazil in stating that
                                the belligerents having requested an immediate cessation of
                                hostilities at their request they were now respectively prepared to
                                cooperate with certain agencies set up by the League report. The
                                Minister felt that if we took such action the United States and
                                Brazil would be preserving in signal and effective manner their
                                leadership in the efforts to establish peace.</p>

                                advised of the intention of the United States before the official
                                replies of the United States are received in Geneva.</p>

                                Foreign Affairs that these replies to the League invitation will not
                                be sent for 2 or 3 days yet and consequently request that the

                            <p>112. In conversation with the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs the
                                latter informed me of the receipt of a cable from the Chilean
                                Ambassador in Washington reporting the decision of the Department
                                regarding the manner in which the United States will cooperate with
                                the special Commissions of the League of Nations looking towards a
                                settlement of the Chaco conflict. The Undersecretary indicated that
                                the Chilean Government is highly pleased with the way in which this
                                matter is developing and especially with the policy of the United
                                States and Brazil. It is, of course, obvious that Chile feels that
                                the inclusion of the United States and Brazil will prevent any final
                                settlement from being dominated by Argentina.</p>

                            <p>84. The two contemplated replies in the Department’s telegram 30,
                                December 4, 4 p.m., were read to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                                this afternoon and he expressed pleasure at the Department’s
                                decision to participate in Buenos Aires, and he wishes the United
                                States would take more part in the Committee in Geneva, and stated
                                that the Department’s message would be taken into account at the
                                Cabinet discussions on the Bolivian reply to the League which are
                                going on and which will continue for a few days more when he thinks
                                the reply may be sent.</p>
                            <p>Judging from the newspaper interview with the Foreign Minister (air
                                despatch No. 195, November 26th<note n="85" xml:id="d169fn85">Not
                                    printed.</note>) it is thought that the reply to the League will
                                be a brief acceptance. However, military authorities may influence
                                the new President toward a less peaceful attitude.</p>
                            <p>Present government is well established and should have few
                                difficulties until March. Nevertheless, having been installed
                                militarily it may so disappear in a few months.</p>

                                Foreign Affairs I had an interview with the President and him this
                                afternoon. After reading the text of the replies quoted in the
                                Department’s telegram and giving them the information contained in
                                the second, third and fourth from the last paragraphs of the
                                Department’s telegram I asked the President if he could give me any
                                information as to the nature of the reply which the Paraguayan
                                Government intends to make to the League. He told me that the
                                official text of the League proposal had only been received today
                                and that his Government is now considering its reply. The President
                                then made the following observations:</p>
                            <p>Paraguay does not want to risk being placed in the position of being
                                held responsible for the failure of any peace proposal but the
                                League plan cannot be accepted as it stands. Paraguay will seek
                                modifications of the plan which would make it acceptable. The
                                specific objections are, first, that the plan does not provide for
                                immediate cessation of hostilities and demobilization of forces but
                                merely for an armistice with troops being held under arms during
                                months of negotiations; second, that the conditions for putting an
                                end to the fighting and establishing a neutral zone are impossible
                                of fulfillment; third, that the League procedure cannot be accepted
                                by Paraguay without the ratification of Congress because it involves
                                agreements about arbitration as well as measures relating to a
                                cessation of military operations.</p>
                            <p>The President stated that he was convinced that Congress would not
                                ratify the League proposal even if it were in session. He said that
                                he thought the procedure was contrary to the Bolivian Constitution
                                also, but that for tactical reasons Bolivia might agree to the
                                League proposal knowing that Paraguay would have to ask for
                                modifications.</p>
                            <p>The President expressed some concern lest the Department’s proposed
                                replies to the League invitations might be construed by world
                                opinion to indicate that the United States Government is attempting
                                to influence a decision to accept the League proposal. He said that
                                he considered the immediate present an inopportune time for any
                                action on the League plan because of instability of the Government
                                of Bolivia. The situation might change in a week or so he thought.
                                The President also said that Paraguay must ask for an investigation
                                of the responsibility for the war.</p>
                            <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0194"/>
                            <p>I feel sure that the Paraguayan reply to the League will amount to a
                                practical rejection of the plan. It was quite evident that both the
                                President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are opposed to the
                                proposal in its present form and are convinced that it could not
                                succeed.</p>

                                    <p>“I duly transmitted to my Government the courteous invitation
                                        of the Assembly of the League of Nations conveyed in your
                                        letter of November 24, 1934, to cooperate in the work of the
                                        Neutral Supervisory Commission set up under paragraph 12 of
                                        part 4 of the report adopted on that date by the Assembly
                                        concerning the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. In
                                        reply I am directed to express the appreciation of my
                                        Government for this invitation and to say that my
                                        Government, taking into consideration that the Neutral
                                        Supervisory Commission will be composed of representatives
                                        of American States meeting on American soil for the specific
                                        purpose of supervising and facilitating the execution of
                                        measures relating to the cessation of hostilities, which
                                        measures would have been previously agreed to by both
                                        parties to the dispute, will be happy to cooperate with the
                                        Neutral Supervisory Commission by appointing a member of the
                                        Commission, who would, however, participate in the labors of
                                        the Commission without the power to vote or to commit the
                                        United States except under specific instructions from the
                                        Government of the United States.</p>
                                    <p>My Government desires me to add a reference to paragraph 13
                                        of part 4 of the report, which provides for a conference of
                                        representatives of American States to meet at Buenos Aires
                                        within 1 month from the date of the cessation of hostilities
                                        for the purpose of conducting negotiations looking to the
                                        conclusion of a treaty of peace. My Government has noted
                                        that the report provides that the President of the Argentine
                                        Republic would be requested to fix the date of the
                                        conference and to invite, among other American States, to
                                        participate therein the States represented on the
                                        ‘Washington Committee of Neutrals’, of which the United
                                        States is one. I am directed to inform you that my
                                        Government upon receipt of an invitation from the President
                                        of the Argentine Republic to take part in such conference
                                        will be happy to accept.”</p>

                                        the aforementioned report. The Advisory Committee, which has
                                        already met at Geneva, is composed of representatives of 23
                                        States, including the States members of the Council of the
                                        League of Nations as well as other States. The Committee has
                                        been constituted ‘to follow the situation, more especially
                                        as regards the execution of the Assembly’s recommendations

                                        League. The Committee shall more particularly bear in mind
                                        the Assembly’s desire that the state of breach of
                                        obligations (of the Covenant of the League of Nations) to

                                        inasmuch as it is not a member of the League of Nations,

                                        Committee. However, in accordance with the policy of my
                                        Government, which it has consistently followed, and
                                        repeatedly announced, of furthering in every possible and
                                        practical manner, the peaceful settlement of this dispute,
                                        my Government will be glad to instruct me to maintain
                                        informal contact with the members of the Advisory Committee
                                        for purposes of information, if this should be found
                                        agreeable by the Committee.”</p>

                            <p>181. Aranha communicated to the Department this morning a cable from
                                his Government which corresponded in general to the information
                                transmitted in your 332, December 5, 8 p.m.<note n="87"
                                    xml:id="d173fn87">Not printed.</note> It is obvious, both from
                                this information and from information received from the Bolivian and
                                Paraguayan Ministers here and from the American Legations in
                                Asunción and La Paz, that neither of the two belligerents is
                                prepared to accept the condition imposed by the Brazilian
                                Government. The Bolivian Minister here states that acceptance by his
                                Government of the Brazilian condition would merely offer Paraguay
                                the way to evade acceptance of the League’s invitation on the ground
                                that Brazil’s participation in the League procedure was
                                indispensable and that since the condition imposed by Brazil for her
                                participation was impracticable Paraguay could therefore not accept
                                the League proposal.</p>
                            <p>… It would, of course, be highly desirable in the interest of all
                                that Brazil should not place herself now in a position from which
                                she cannot recede and which would make her participation with the
                                United States and the other Republics of this Continent in the peace
                                move impossible.</p>
                            <p>You may say to the Foreign Minister that this Government deeply
                                appreciates the very frank way in which the Brazilian Government has
                                communicated its own views to this Government and that the United
                                States sincerely regrets that it is unable to adopt the suggestion
                                offered by the Brazilian Government to insist upon cessation of
                                hostilities as a prerequisite to its participation in the proposal
                                of the League; nevertheless it trusts that the situation may so
                                develop as to make it possible for Brazil to express its willingness
                                to participate with the United States and the other American
                                Republics in this new peace movement should both of the belligerents
                                accept the League proposal. You may state further that in accordance
                                with the information previously conveyed to the Brazilian
                                Government, the replies sent by the United States to the
                                Secretary-General of the League will be delivered tomorrow, Friday,
                                morning, and will be made public here in the course of the same
                                day.</p>

                            <p>336. Department’s 181, December 6, 6 p.m. In communicating your
                                instruction to the Foreign Minister, he stated that he now had a
                                definite reply from Bolivia accepting his proposals that she cease
                                hostilities immediately in return for Brazilian participation in the
                                League peace proposals. This had just been communicated to him
                                orally by the Bolivian Minister who, upon his request, was to give
                                it to him in written official form later this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister felt that under the circumstances he would have
                                to keep the matter under further consideration.</p>
                            <p>He thought that with this Bolivian acceptance in hand he could now
                                force Paraguay into an acceptance of his proposals.</p>
                            <p>I thereupon emphasized the point contained in the penultimate
                                sentence of the Department’s telegram under reference and said that
                                I hoped that even if Paraguay did not accept his proposal but did
                                accept the League recommendations that Brazil would be prepared to
                                participate. The Foreign Minister replied that it seemed clear to
                                him that if Paraguay refused his proposal it would be only because
                                she intended to refuse the League recommendations. I again observed,
                                as I had done in previous conversations, that there seemed to be a
                                clear distinction between the two and once more pressed the point.
                                The Minister then said that if Paraguay did not reply to his
                                proposal within about a week he would inform her of his intention to
                                accept the League’s invitation in terms similar to those of the
                                American answers with the exception of giving full powers to the
                                Brazilian member of the Neutral Supervisory Commission and adding
                                that in an humanitarian effort he had attempted to obtain the
                                immediate cessation of hostilities and that while Bolivia had
                                acceded to his request Paraguay had refused to accept. He hoped this
                                would constitute sufficient pressure to bring Paraguay into
                                line.</p>

                            <p>381. Avenol informed me late last evening that the Chaco Advisory
                                Committee would meet on Wednesday, December 12, instead of December
                                20 and that he would send me an informal letter inviting me “to <pb
                                    n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0198"/>be present if I desired in
                                order conveniently to be informed of the proceedings”. Knowing the
                                situation I wish to make clear that in this Avenol did not in his
                                view place any strained construction on the final paragraph of my
                                communication to him of December 7 (Department’s 126, December 6, 6
                                p.m.) but rather to meet the suggestion expressed therein by the
                                best means at his disposal and in a manner to him entirely normal. I
                                may add that I could undoubtedly arrange to have such a
                                communication worded in any way that might be desired.</p>
                            <p>I immediately replied that I preferred that he not bring this
                                question forward at this time. He readily acquiesced. Thus if
                                desired the matter may rest at that point. I nevertheless feel it
                                desirable to acquaint the Department with all of the pertinent
                                factors of the situation here in order that in a matter of policy of
                                this character the case may be considered on its merits.</p>

                                    rendered misinterpretation of our position virtually

                                    regarded here as having psychological values favorable to
                                    satisfactory achievement and thus is the course we are looked to

                                    endeavored to make appear as casual as possible. But this method
                                    is at best unsatisfactory and in it is a certain lack of dignity
                                    in respect of a question in which we are so evidently

                            <p>128. Your 381, December 11, 10 a.m. The acceptance in part by this
                                Government of the invitations extended by the League is necessarily
                                contingent upon the acceptance by the two belligerents of the League
                                Report. Until such time, therefore, as the reply of Paraguay is
                                determined upon, it would seem clearly desirable for you to refrain
                                from being present at any of the sessions of the Chaco Advisory
                                Committee.</p>
                            <p>Should the League Report be accepted by both belligerents, the nature
                                of the “informal contact”, which the League was informed you would
                                be instructed to maintain with the Chaco Advisory Committee, would
                                be determined by considerations of convenience and the practical
                                advantages to be obtained. While the Department has given full and
                                sympathetic consideration to the various points which you bring
                                forward, you will realize that this Government has already
                                determined not to take part in the deliberations of the Advisory
                                Committee and it would unquestionably be regarded as at least
                                passive participation by the United States if its representative
                                were present at the meetings of the Committee. It would seem
                                probable that Avenol, or the chairman of the Committee, in order to
                                make your “informal contact” effective, might readily arrange to
                                advise you fully of all of the important matters dealt with by the
                                Committee.</p>

                            <p>386. 1. The Department’s telegram No. 128, December 11, 5 p.m. was
                                exceedingly useful in reaffirming the Department’s pertinent basic
                                policy which I have consistently employed as background and more
                                specifically in stating its application to the technical point in
                                question. This opportunely enabled me yesterday morning before the
                                Committee meeting to discuss with Avenol (without however disclosing
                                to him all of the Department’s preoccupations) the possible
                                machinery of our <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0200"/>being kept
                                informed and at the same time to suggest to him the desirability of
                                preventing if possible any untoward discussion in the Committee of
                                the American position in this matter.</p>
                            <p>2. The following is a summary of the Committee’s report which was
                                handed me by the Secretariat.</p>

                                <item>—Noted that the Bolivian reply constitutes an unreserved
                                    acceptance of the Assembly’s recommendations and decided to
                                    inform the representative of Paraguay thereof.</item>

                                    the Buenos Aires peace conference. It accepted the United States
                                    Government’s proposal that contact should be established between
                                    the members of the Committee and the United States Consul in
                                    Geneva and instructed its Bureau (the Secretary General and the

                            <p>3. The Secretariat also apprised me orally as follows:</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian representative who was present in the Committee assumed
                                an attitude which was easily forecast by the general atmosphere of
                                the Bolivian position here to the effect that her acceptance of the
                                recommendations in a sense morally relieves her of responsibilities
                                respecting the Chaco. Specifically the Bolivian representative: <list>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>—Asserted that after December 16 (6 days following the
                                        date of Bolivia’s acceptance) all responsibility for loss of
                                        life in the Chaco would rest with Paraguay. The Committee
                                        merely pointed out that the import of the pertinent
                                        provision in the report was that the 6 days would run after
                                        the acceptance of the revised text by both parties.</item>

                                    <item>—Notified the Committee that he would raise the question
                                        of the arms embargo after the 20th. The Committee thereupon
                                        decided to reconvene on December 20.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>—Asked that the meetings of the Committee be public in
                                        order that the Bolivian position might be generally known.
                                        The Committee took no action but the matter may come forward
                                        at its next meeting.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>4. It was originally intended that the meeting of December 12 should
                                take the place of that which had been scheduled for December 20. The
                                reason alleged for this was that the presence of a large number of
                                delegates in Geneva to the Extraordinary Council would render the
                                former date more convenient. The Bolivian statement respecting the
                                embargo cited above rendered technically necessary the holding of an
                                additional meeting on December 20. I may comment however that <pb
                                    n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0201"/>upon the abandoning of the
                                original plan to hold the meeting on the 20th rumors were current
                                here that this move was instigated by Argentina presumably with the
                                thought that the Paraguayan material position in the Chaco would be
                                more advantageous by January 11 when the Committee would have next
                                convened simultaneously with the January Council which is now
                                scheduled for that date.</p>
                            <p>5. I learn from other sources that the following also occurred in the
                                Committee respecting the American position:</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)—The Advisory Committee. Madariaga took
                                issue with the phrase “informal contact” asserting that there could
                                neither juridically nor appropriately be an informal relationship
                                with a responsible official body. He felt that there should be a
                                clearer definition or interpretation of the American position.
                                Citing precedents of our presence in similar bodies in the
                                Sino-Japanese and Leticia affairs he interpreted the present
                                American external attitude as a substantive change in policy.</p>

                                    League Council and Chairman of the Chaco Committee of

                                of the Committee’s leaving the matter of contact with the United
                                States to be arranged with me as stated above.</p>
                            <p>(b)—Supervisory Commission. Guani (Uruguay) took exception to the
                                phrasing in our communication “representatives of American States
                                meeting on American soil” asserting at some length that it by
                                inference misinterpreted the character of the Commission which was a
                                League organ. He likewise suggested that political motives including
                                the Monroe Doctrine lay back of our whole relationship to this
                                matter of which the phrase in question was illustrative.</p>
                            <p>6. I am not informed whether other representatives took part in the
                                discussion on the two points mentioned above and it may be that the
                                information as I received it is an over-statement. I gather the
                                impression that the general attitude of the Committee members is to
                                make light of these matters and to regard them as
                                inconsequential.</p>
                            <p>7. In conversations with the Brazilian representative here I told him
                                that in view of the similarity in our status I would keep him
                                informed of such attitudes as we might adopt here. He said that he
                                would be glad to do the same. Later he told me that he had informed
                                his Government of my “very helpful offer”. I mention this solely
                                because the Brazilians might speak of it. I trust that the
                                Department will understand that I would only inform him of what was
                                appropriate.</p>

                            <p>393. 1. Secretary-General has received a telegram from the Paraguayan
                                Government under date of December 18 submitting in detail objections
                                to the essential provisions of the recommendations of the Assembly
                                for the settlement of the Chaco conflict. This reply is considered
                                as tantamount to a rejection.</p>
                            <p>2. A reply from Brazil to the invitation to participate in the bodies

                                same as that of the United States except that the Brazilian member
                                of the Neutral Supervisory Commission will be provided with full

                            <p>394. Consulate’s 393, December 19, 5 p.m., paragraph 1. At the close
                                of its meeting last night the Advisory Committee on the Chaco sent
                                the following telegram to the Paraguayan Government: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Advisory Committee met on December 20th and took note of
                                        your telegram of December 19th. It feels that it must revert
                                        to certain points which have been raised by the Paraguayan
                                        Government. Before doing so it desires to point out that
                                        after receiving the observations of the Paraguayan
                                        Government and with the object of meeting those
                                        observations, the Assembly made important changes, more
                                        particularly in the military provisions, in its first draft
                                        report. The authentic text was sent to you on November 24th.
                                        Some of your observations appear, however, to refer to the
                                        first draft.</p>
                                    <p>The cessation of hostilities proposed is definitive; this is
                                        an essential condition of the recommendations of the
                                        Assembly, the latter being particularly concerned to prevent
                                        the continuation of the breach of the Covenant. The plan
                                        does not provide for a long armistice, but for a final
                                        cessation of hostilities. It does not leave the armies on a
                                        war footing; it provides for demobilization, which is to
                                        begin immediately, under the supervision of the Neutral
                                        Supervisory Commission. Paraguay having always demanded
                                        adequate measures of security, the Supervisory Commission,
                                        composed of representatives of American states, provides for
                                        the most effective and most impartial measures. It has very
                                        wide terms of reference and must take the most appropriate
                                        steps. The report fixes no arbitrary distance, but leaves it
                                        to the Commission to organize security according to
                                        practical necessities.</p>
                                    <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0203"/>
                                    <p>The Committee is therefore convinced that the Supervisory
                                        Commission will be able to prevent any dangerous incidents,
                                        and should such occur, to settle them rapidly. Such a system
                                        of security is necessary in order that demobilization may be
                                        actively pursued once it has begun. Should it not have been
                                        completed by the time the Buenos Aires conference opens, the
                                        latter will deal with the matter urgently.</p>
                                    <p>As regards the time limits for the negotiations it is
                                        stipulated that these time limits may be prolonged by
                                        agreement between the parties. It is obvious that if there
                                        is a possibility of voluntary agreement there will at the
                                        same time be a possibility of agreement to extend the time
                                        limits. It should not be forgotten that these negotiations
                                        will take place with the active cooperation of the 10
                                        American states mentioned in paragraph 13 of the report. The
                                        United States of America and the United States of Brazil
                                        having agreed to participate the Committee considers that
                                        the question of prisoners could be dealt with at the Buenos
                                        Aires peace conference.</p>
                                    <p>As regards the conditions for a possible recourse to the
                                        Permanent Court of International Justice the Assembly only
                                        contemplates such recourse to a judicial settlement in the
                                        event of the failure of direct negotiations; it hopes that
                                        this eventuality will not arise, but in its recommendations
                                        under article 15 it is obliged to provide for it. The
                                        formula proposed for submitting the substantive questions to
                                        The Hague Court does not sanction any particular view of the
                                        case; it in no way diminishes the freedom of each of the
                                        parties to uphold their proposals.</p>
                                    <p>The Assembly has not lost sight of the constitutional
                                        questions to which the Paraguayan delegate had already drawn
                                        its attention. It considers that if the Paraguayan
                                        Government was prepared to accept the recommendations, it
                                        would be able to submit them to Parliament for the latter to
                                        take a decision one way or the other within the shortest
                                        time permitted by the Constitution, that is if necessary at
                                        an extraordinary session summoned for the purpose. It should
                                        moreover be pointed out that these recommendations do not
                                        formulate a settlement of the substantive question, but
                                        merely a method of settlement.</p>
                                    <p>The Committee concurs in the Paraguayan Government’s view
                                        that what is necessary is to ensure the immediate and final
                                        cessation of hostilities and the negotiation of a peace in
                                        an atmosphere conducive to a settlement based on reason and
                                        justice. Such was the very purpose of the Assembly’s report
                                        in recommending the immediate cessation of hostilities and
                                        the conference of Buenos Aires.</p>
                                    <p>The Assembly desired to arrest hostilities between two of its
                                        members by recommending to them practical means whereby
                                        peace might be reestablished and the system of the covenants
                                        to which they are parties again brought into observance. In
                                        its report the Assembly deliberately aimed at the
                                        restoration of peace in the future. The agenda of the
                                        conference of Buenos Aires is a statement of the questions
                                        which in its opinion call for settlement; but this does not
                                        preclude the two parties from asking the conference that
                                        other questions such as those mentioned in your telegram
                                        should be included.</p>
                                    <p>The Committee hopes that its explanations will be given
                                        serious consideration by the Paraguayan Government and will
                                        facilitate its acceptance of the Assembly’s recommendations
                                        the execution of which <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134"

                                        it has not the power to change.</p>
                                    <p>The Committee will reassemble on January the 14th and
                                        urgently requests the Paraguayan Government to communicate
                                        its final reply by that date as it will be its duty to draw
                                        up a report in accordance with its terms of reference.”</p>

                                Its report has not yet been issued but an official of the

                                        Assembly’s recommendations and what effect such attitude
                                        might have on the situation, particularly as regards the
                                        arms embargo.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>2. From other sources I have been informed that Russia and
                                Czechoslovakia in yesterday’s meeting designated Paraguay’s reply as
                                a flat rejection and urged immediate decisions. The Latin-Americans
                                led by Argentina took the position that Paraguay’s response was an
                                “interim reply” and left the door open for further
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>I am likewise informed that in today’s meeting the discussion
                                centered around the embargo. The Italian delegate said that his
                                Government had never favored the placing of an embargo
                                indiscriminately against both parties but had consented to
                                participation in the embargo action because of uncertainty as to the
                                responsibilities of the parties <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135"
                                    facs="0205"/>but now that the question of responsibility was
                                clearer and would be still clearer on January 14 he urged the
                                Committee at its next meeting to direct the embargo solely against
                                the responsible party. This attitude was supported by France, Russia
                                and Poland, France stating that the Covenant must be strictly
                                applied. The British representative was less direct in his
                                statements but appeared to acquiesce.</p>
                            <p>The Latin-American delegates took little part in the embargo
                                discussion except that Chile and Uruguay declined responsibility as
                                to transit.</p>
                            <p>I learn that the Latin-Americans feel that Paraguay is playing for
                                time in order to gain possession of the oil fields in the Chaco.</p>

                                that the Presidents of Peru and Colombia have agreed to promote a
                                conference for the purpose of initiating direct negotiations between
                                Bolivia and Paraguay and co-operating in the friendly settlement of
                                the Chaco question. The conference would be attended by Delegates
                                from Argentine, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, United States, Mexico
                                and the belligerent nations. The Bolivian Government have accepted
                                this form of mediation; but the Government of Paraguay, intent
                                mainly upon realizing an immediate demobilization and upon obtaining
                                guarantees that would prevent a new attack on their forces, have
                                replied to the President of Peru that the League of Nations’
                                mediation is still pending, but will practically terminate at the
                                beginning of July, when the Council approves the report from the
                                Special Committee.</p>

                            <p>75. During the course of the visit here by Dr. Alfonso Lopez,<note
                                    n="92" xml:id="d182fn92">President-elect of Colombia.</note> the
                                latter discussed with the President and with the Department the
                                questions <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0206"/>involved in the
                                Chaco controversy and the initiative recently taken by the
                                Governments of Colombia and Peru. Dr. Lopez expressed his belief
                                that the time had come when Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru,
                                Colombia, Mexico and the United States should make a move to urge
                                upon the belligerent nations the desirability of accepting their
                                good offices with a view to finding a pacific solution of the
                                dispute and that it seemed highly unwise to wait until September
                                with any hope that the League of Nations would be able to take
                                effective action at such time. Dr. Lopez was advised that this
                                Government, as it had frequently stated in the past, was always
                                ready to cooperate in any movement looking towards a peaceful
                                solution of the controversy provided that such movement seemed to
                                hold promise of success and further that such a move met with the
                                consent of the two parties to the controversy. He was further
                                informed that this Government inclined to the belief that the
                                dispute had now reached a stage where it affected the interests of
                                all of the Republics of the Continent and that the solution of the
                                dispute was necessarily a matter of joint concern to the American
                                Republics and implied a responsibility which all should be willing
                                to shoulder. No more specific commitments, however, were made by
                                this Government.</p>
                            <p>Subsequently, the Department of State received an official invitation
                                from the Government of Peru<note n="93" xml:id="d182fn93"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> requesting it to cooperate
                                with Colombia and Peru, as well as with the Governments of
                                Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, in promoting a conference to
                                be attended by delegates from those Governments “for the purpose of
                                initiating direct negotiations between Bolivia and Paraguay.” The
                                Peruvian Government stated that “the Bolivian Government have
                                accepted this form of mediation; but the Government of Paraguay,
                                intent mainly upon realizing an immediate demobilization and of
                                obtaining guaranties that would prevent a new attack on their
                                forces, have replied to the President of Peru that the League of
                                Nations mediation is still pending and will practically terminate at
                                the beginning of July when the Council approves the report of the
                                Special Committee.”</p>
                            <p>This Government has not as yet replied officially to this invitation
                                of the Government of Peru.</p>
                            <p>In response to a confidential inquiry as to his views in the matter,
                                Dr. Saavedra Lamas has indicated that while in a general sense
                                Argentina will always be ready to cooperate in any effective move
                                towards peace, Argentina finds herself in a peculiar position, since
                                she is a member of the Council of the League of Nations, and has
                                indicated his hope that this Government will agree to a short period
                                of delay before reaching any final decision in order that he might
                                present for our consideration bases for action which contemplate the
                                tender of <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0207"/>good offices by
                                Argentina, Brazil and the United States acting in cooperation with
                                the Council of the League of Nations. Dr. Saavedra Lamas has been
                                informed by this Government in reply to his suggestion, that this
                                Government, of course, will await with interest the suggestions
                                which he intends to offer, but that it feels that any prolonged
                                delay will be counter to the interests of the Continent and that
                                from all information received, opinion among the American Republics
                                is now crystallizing very rapidly in favor of an inter-American
                                conference. The views of Dr. Saavedra Lamas and the opinion
                                expressed to him by this Government are transmitted to you solely
                                for your personal and confidential information.</p>
                            <p>The Department desires you to discuss the general questions involved
                                with the appropriate officials of the Brazilian Government and
                                advise the Department by cable at the earliest opportunity whether
                                the Brazilian Government has received an invitation from the
                                Governments of Colombia and Peru similar to that received by this
                                Government. Please ascertain likewise what the views of the
                                Government of Brazil may be in the matter and advise the Department
                                whether the Government of Brazil will be more inclined to favor an
                                inter-American conference or a conference limited to a smaller
                                number of American Republics and in the latter event, whether it
                                would consider the formula suggested by the Governments of Colombia
                                and Peru more effective than a possible move by Argentina, Brazil
                                and the United States acting in cooperation with the Council of the
                                League. It is important at this time that you make it plain that the
                                Government of the United States has not as yet reached any
                                conclusion with regard to the questions under consideration and that
                                it would greatly value an expression of opinion from the Government
                                of Brazil which it considers of the greatest importance for the
                                purpose of advancing the cause of peace on the Continent through the
                                friendly cooperation of all the American Republics.</p>

                                garbled. I have consequently been able to take it up with the
                                Foreign Minister only this afternoon. In the meantime he had
                                received and answered a telegram from the Brazilian Chargé
                                d’Affaires in Washington who has doubtless acquainted you with his

                                <item>The essential point of Dr. Cavalcanti’s statement is that the
                                    Brazilian Government is convinced that the only hope of solution
                                    lies in “negotiations in utmost secrecy” with a view to
                                    ascertaining whether any formula can be discovered which can be
                                    accepted by the two parties. If such a formula is found and
                                    definite assurances obtained as to its acceptance then only
                                    would the Brazilian Government believe in the desirability of
                                    convening an international conference. In the event this can be
                                    achieved they attach no importance to the number of American
                                    states invited to participate, as the conference would be
                                    convened merely to give public form to an agreement already
                                    reached.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>Dr. Cavalcanti said he greatly hoped no conference would be called
                                until the possibilities of private negotiation had been exhausted,
                                as he felt that if a public discussion of this matter ended in
                                failure it would prejudice any further move toward bringing about a
                                peaceful solution.</p>
                            <p>The views of the Brazilian Government have been made known now or
                                previously to the representatives of Peru and Colombia, Bolivia and
                                Paraguay, Chile and the Argentine so that there can presumably be no
                                misapprehension as to the Brazilian position in this whole
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>Newly arrived Bolivian Minister has asked whether Brazilian
                                Government would suggest to Paraguay acceptance of an agreement
                                under which certain specified territories would be recognized to
                                each of the parties and only a limited zone left to arbitration. He
                                was told that the Brazilian Government would not suggest any formula
                                of agreement.</p>
                            <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0209"/>
                            <p>In conclusion Dr. Cavalcanti said that he was particularly anxious to
                                work in full cooperation with the United States in this matter and
                                would be glad to have the benefit of your views at any time they
                                could be afforded him.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge
                                the receipt of Your Excellency’s note of June 26th advising me that
                                the President[s] of Peru and Colombia have agreed to promote a
                                conference for the purpose of initiating direct negotiations between
                                Bolivia and Paraguay and of cooperating in the friendly settlement
                                of the Chaco question. The conference would be attended by delegates
                                from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, the United States,
                                Mexico, and the belligerent nations. Your Excellency further states
                                that the Bolivian Government has accepted the form of mediation
                                proposed but that the Government of Paraguay has indicated to the
                                President of Peru in its reply its inability to accept the
                                invitation on the ground that the mediation of the League of Nations
                                is still pending.</p>
                            <p>Finally, Your Excellency informs me that the Government of Peru would
                                greatly appreciate it were the Government of the United States to
                                support the proposed project of a conference, feeling sure that an
                                important step would thus be taken in bringing to a close the
                                deplorable Chaco conflict.</p>
                            <p>I have the honor to request that Your Excellency will be good enough
                                to advise the Government of Peru of the deep appreciation felt by
                                the Government of the United States for the information thus
                                conveyed to it and for the invitation so graciously extended. My
                                Government feels, as does the Government of Peru, that it is an
                                obligation incumbent upon the republics of the American continent to
                                further in every friendly way possible the peaceful settlement of
                                any and all controversies arising on the continent since hostilities
                                between two American republics inevitably involve the interests of
                                every other American republic inasmuch as the peace, welfare and
                                economic stability of the continent are affected thereby. My
                                Government further believes that the notable precedent recently
                                created by the Governments of Peru and Colombia in the pacific
                                solution of the controversy which had unfortunately arisen between
                                    them,<note n="95" xml:id="d184fn95">See <ref target="#pg_321"
                                        >pp. 321</ref> ff.</note> affords a welcome proof that
                                controversies arising over boundary adjustments are susceptible of
                                an equitable and peaceful solution and <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140"
                                    facs="0210"/>that for that reason the initiative so laudably
                                taken by the Governments of Peru and Colombia at this time was
                                peculiarly fitting.</p>
                            <p>As the Government of Peru is well aware, this Government, throughout
                                the period during which the hostilities in the Chaco have continued,
                                has held itself ready at all times to further in every possible way
                                the promotion of peace between Bolivia and Paraguay, provided such
                                cooperation on its part were welcome to the two belligerent nations.
                                Unfortunately, from Your Excellency’s note under acknowledgment as
                                well as from information which has reached this Government from
                                other sources, it appears that the Government of Paraguay is not
                                willing at this moment to accept the invitation extended by Your
                                Excellency’s Government and by that of Colombia. After very careful
                                deliberation the Government of the United States has reached the
                                conclusion that it might, therefore, be productive of more
                                beneficial results to postpone for the time being the consideration
                                of calling the proposed conference, in the hope that an opportunity
                                may very soon arise when both the belligerent nations engaged in the
                                war in the Chaco may be disposed to participate in a conference
                                called for the purpose of assisting them to find a peaceful solution
                                to this tragic dispute.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion may I state that this Government applauds the noble
                                initiative taken by the Governments of Peru and Colombia and finds
                                itself most heartily in agreement with the belief of those two
                                Governments thus manifested that the American nations should
                                cooperate in promoting the peaceful adjudication of all
                                controversies which may arise on this continent.</p>
                            <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                                        <hi rend="italic">supra.</hi></note> prepared by Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas and submitted to the Paraguayan President and to the
                                Bolivian Government. The Department is informed that the Argentine
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs is “certain of Paraguayan acceptance”.
                                It further understands that the suggested formula has been under
                                discussion with the Paraguayan Government for some time and that the
                                Argentine Government has positive reason to believe that it is
                                acceptable to Paraguay. The Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                states that the success of this attempted mediation now rests on the
                                attitude of the Bolivian President and feels that every possible
                                influence should be brought to bear to secure his acceptance of the
                                project. He has requested the whole-hearted support of this
                                Government and has urged that the influence of the United States be
                                brought to bear upon Bolivia in order to procure the acceptance of
                                that Government. The Department is further informed that a copy of
                                the conciliation formula was handed yesterday by Dr. Saavedra Lamas
                                to the Brazilian Ambassador in Buenos Aires and that such
                                communication had only been made to the Brazilian and the United
                                States Governments.</p>

                                        p.m., are, of course, entitled to the fullest respect and
                                        the most sympathetic consideration by this Government. The
                                        Government of the United States, however, does not assume
                                        that the Government of Brazil would be unwilling to
                                        cooperate in any peace move merely on the ground that the
                                        matter was technically still in the hands of the League so
                                        long as the Brazilian Government has valid reason to believe
                                        that such a peace move had reasonable prospects of success.
                                        While there is not as yet complete “assurance that a
                                        solution has been found which would be acceptable to the two
                                        contending parties” as stated in Clause B, paragraph 2 of
                                        your cable above referred to, the nature of the conciliation
                                        formula, the assurances given that this formula is certain
                                        of acceptance by Paraguay, and the particularly cordial
                                        relations existing between Bolivia and Brazil would seem to
                                        offer reasonable hope for the success of this peace move if
                                        the Brazilian Government were to join with the United States

                                may feel disposed to cooperate in the manner indicated inasmuch as

                                lost for bringing about the fair and peaceful settlement of the

                                point out to him that Bio de Janeiro has had the good fortune of
                                being the seat of the conference which brought about the successful
                                termination of the Leticia dispute, a fact which will always be
                                remembered by the American republics, and that in the special
                                circumstances it would be regrettable if any objection as to the
                                seat of the conference as proposed by the Argentine Government were
                                to involve a breakdown of these present negotiations.</p>

                                through the good offices of Argentina, Brazil and the United States,
                                the other republics of the continent should then be invited to join
                                when the formula is officially and publicly presented to Bolivia and
                                Paraguay. This suggestion is in line with the suggestion of the
                                Brazilian Government as conveyed in paragraph 5 of your cable under
                                reference.</p>

                            <p>Finally, you may state that we reciprocate wholeheartedly the
                                sentiments expressed by Dr. Cavalcanti and that we deem it essential
                                to work in full cooperation with his Government, and that in
                                accordance with his request we have thus communicated very frankly
                                our view and our sincere belief that the present move offers promise
                                of practical success provided Brazil is willing to take part in
                                it.</p>

                                    printed.</note> The Argentine Ambassador yesterday handed the
                                Department the copy of the conciliation formula. He was this morning
                                informed as follows:</p>
                            <p>This Government is now as always disposed to exert every effort to
                                promote a peaceful solution of the Chaco dispute and to cooperate
                                with the Argentine Government towards that end provided such
                                cooperation is agreeable to the two nations at war and provided
                                further that such a move appears to hold the promise of success.
                                Predicated upon the assumption that the formula of Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas would be accepted unequivocally by Paraguay in accordance with
                                the assurances given by the Argentine Foreign Minister, the
                                Government of the United States will be glad to cooperate with the
                                Argentine Government in support of this formula and to urge
                                acceptance by the Government of Bolivia in the belief that the
                                Government of Brazil will likewise cooperate in the same manner.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Ambassador has further been told to inform Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas that this Government has immediately cabled the American
                                Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro to express the earnest hope of this
                                Government that Brazil will cooperate in the manner indicated and
                                has made similar representations to the Brazilian Chargé
                                d’Affaires.</p>
                            <p>If the reply received from the Brazilian Government is satisfactory,
                                we would then be prepared to make the most earnest recommendation to
                                the Bolivian Government that the proposed formula be accepted by
                                Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>We have also indicated to the Argentine Ambassador that it is our
                                most sincere belief that if a confidential acceptance in principle
                                of the formula can be obtained as the result of the good offices of
                                Argentina, Brazil, and the United States, Peru and Colombia and the
                                other republics of this continent should immediately be invited to
                                join in presenting the formula to Bolivia and Paraguay for their
                                official acceptance. We have emphasized our belief that the question
                                    <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0215"/>of promoting peace on
                                the continent is one of continental responsibility and that the
                                action thus proposed would create a very highly important and useful
                                precedent.</p>
                            <p>For your personal and confidential information, you will realize that
                                the practical hope of success depends upon the unequivocal
                                acceptance by Paraguay and to a large extent upon the participation
                                at this time by Brazil in the joint representations to be made to
                                Bolivia. It is further obvious that the chances of success would be
                                greatly prejudiced if there is any publicity given to the present
                                move.</p>

                            <p>135. Department’s 80, July 14, 3 p.m. Minister for Foreign Affairs is
                                sending instructions to the Brazilian Minister at La Paz to urge
                                upon Bolivian Government acceptance of Argentine formula.</p>
                            <p>He states that there is no possible objection to the conference
                                meeting in Buenos Aires and I even gather it is preferred that the
                                meeting should not be in Rio.</p>
                            <p>He is in full agreement as to inviting the other American Republics
                                after definite acceptance by both parties.</p>
                            <p>It is felt that chances of acceptance by Bolivia have not been
                                improved by allowing newspaper publicity (Havas despatch from Buenos
                                Aires) to the fact that Paraguay has already been consulted and
                                accepted as Bolivian reaction is likely to be that this implies the
                                formula is disadvantageous from the Bolivian point of view. However,
                                since matters have gone this far Brazilian Government is prepared to
                                cooperate to the full and I believe Department may rest assured that
                                Brazilian attitude will not be affected by any concern as to whether
                                the Argentine will get credit.</p>

                                orally and textually on behalf of the Government of the United

                                        Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs and submitted to the
                                        Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay. As the Government of
                                        Bolivia is aware, the Government of the United States is now
                                        as always disposed to exert every effort to promote a
                                        peaceful solution of this tragic war on terms equally
                                        honorable to both countries and to cooperate with any
                                        nation, or group of nations, or any organization, towards
                                        that end, provided such cooperation is agreeable to the two
                                        nations at war. Your Excellency will recall the earnest
                                        efforts which the Secretary of State of the United States
                                        made in that sense during the course of the Inter-American
                                        Conference at Montevideo.</p>
                                    <p>The Argentine Government has requested the cooperation of the
                                        Governments of Brazil and of the United States in supporting
                                        the conciliation formula thus presented to the Government of
                                        Bolivia.</p>
                                    <p>My Government has carefully examined the formula submitted
                                        for the consideration of Your Excellency’s Government by the
                                        Argentine Government and believes it to be a method for
                                        arriving at a fair and equitable solution of this long
                                        standing controversy through direct conciliation and in the
                                        event that such direct conciliation might regrettably not
                                        prove practicable, the method suggested would provide for
                                        the submission of the question to the arbitral decision of
                                        the Permanent Court of International Justice.</p>
                                    <p>As an impartial friend of both Bolivia and Paraguay, the
                                        Government of the United States is sure that the Government
                                        of Bolivia will recognize that in view of this opportunity
                                        which has thus been presented for adjusting through peaceful

                                        wealth of both the Governments involved and which has been a
                                        cause of such grave disquiet to the friends of peace on the
                                        American continent, the Government of the United States
                                        cannot but express its most earnest and sincere hope that
                                        the Government of Bolivia will find it feasible to accept
                                        the invitation thus conveyed.</p>
                                    <p>My Government has expressed the hope to the Government of
                                        Argentina that should it be possible for the Governments of
                                        Bolivia and Paraguay to reach a confidential agreement upon
                                        the bases proposed, all of the American republics should be
                                        invited to join in presenting the suggested conciliation
                                        formula officially to those two Governments.</p>
                                    <p>In conclusion I am instructed to state to Your Excellency
                                        that my Government trusts that the Government of Bolivia
                                        will appreciate the motives of sincere friendship which
                                        prompt the Government of the United States to express the
                                        very earnest hope that this opportunity for reaching a
                                        peaceful settlement of the Chaco war may not be
                                        rejected”.</p>

                            <p>Please cable the Department immediately the reply which may be made
                                to you by the Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs and keep the
                                Department closely advised by cable of all subsequent developments.
                                You should also cable whether the Brazilian Minister has as yet made
                                representations in a similar sense to the Bolivian Government.</p>

                            <p>66. Upon receipt yesterday of information that the Brazilian
                                Government had determined to support the conciliation formula and
                                had instructed its Minister in La Paz accordingly, this Government
                                immediately instructed the American Minister in La Paz to represent
                                to the Bolivian Government the earnest hope of the Government of the
                                United States that the Bolivian Government would be disposed to
                                accept the formula presented to it. Similar representations have
                                been made in the most urgent manner this morning to the Bolivian
                                Minister in Washington. You may inform Dr. Saavedra Lamas
                                accordingly.</p>
                            <p>For your own information and for such use thereof as you may deem
                                appropriate in your conversations with the Argentine Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, this Government believes that the successful result
                                of the present negotiations can only be obtained by making it
                                possible for the Bolivian Government to suggest such modifications
                                to the formula as it may deem fitting and desirable, provided solely
                                that the modifications suggested do not change the essential
                                features of the formula as now drafted. It would be deeply
                                regrettable if the possibility of the reaching of a satisfactory
                                accord were impeded by the insistence on the part of either the
                                Government of Paraguay or the Government of Argentina upon some
                                technicality of no fundamental importance. It is further believed
                                that the active support of the essential features of the formula by
                                the Governments of Brazil and of the United States and their
                                continued active participation in the progress of negotiations would
                                be the strongest possible inducement to Bolivia to accept the
                                proffered invitation and furthermore, that the eventual cooperation
                                by the other republics of this continent suggested by this
                                Government would under present conditions be favorably regarded by
                                Bolivia and would act as a further inducement.</p>
                            <p>Please express to Dr. Saavedra Lamas the satisfaction felt by this
                                Government at its ability to cooperate in the interests of peace
                                with his Government and with that of Brazil and express to him our
                                earnest hope that he will keep this Government fully advised both of
                                his views and of all phases in the development of the existing
                                negotiations. You may add that this Government will be particularly
                                glad to keep in constant contact with the Argentine Foreign Office
                                in order that we may thus transmit to him all information of a
                                pertinent nature that comes to our attention as well as our own
                                observations concerning developments.</p>

                            <p>82. Your 135, July 16, 4 p.m. Please express to the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs the sincere gratification of this Government at the
                                reply given by the Brazilian Government to the message contained in
                                the Department’s telegram 80, July 14, 3 p.m.</p>
                            <p>This Government is in entire accord with the view expressed by the
                                Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs that the situation has not
                                been benefited by the newspaper publicity which has unfortunately
                                arisen.</p>
                            <p>You may advise the Brazilian Government that immediately upon receipt
                                of information that the Brazilian Minister in La Paz had been
                                instructed to urge acceptance of the conciliation formula presented
                                to the Bolivian Government, a similar instruction was sent to the
                                American Minister in that capital and that representations of like
                                nature were made this morning by the Secretary of State to the
                                Bolivian Minister in Washington. It is apparent that if the Bolivian
                                Government decides to accept as a basis the conciliation formula
                                presented, it will do so because of the support of that proposal by
                                the Brazilian and the United States Governments and that phase of
                                the proposal has been emphasized in our conversations with the
                                Bolivian Minister here. It is further believed that if a successful
                                result of the present negotiation is to be obtained the Bolivian
                                Government must be afforded full opportunity to make such proposals
                                for modification of the suggested formula as it may deem fitting and
                                desirable, provided solely that such suggested modifications do not
                                change the essential features of the formula as now drafted.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, please state to the Brazilian Government that the
                                response of the Brazilian Government has been a matter of peculiar
                                satisfaction to the Government of the United States and that we will
                                welcome all information or observations throughout the course of
                                these negotiations that the Brazilian Government may desire to
                                convey to us and that the Government of the United States in turn
                                will keep the Brazilian Government fully informed both of its own
                                views and of all information that it may receive regarding the
                                course of the proceedings.</p>

                                    p.m.<note n="99" xml:id="d192fn99">Latter not printed.</note> In
                                its exchange of views with the Brazilian Government and in the
                                opinions expressed to the Argentine Government, this Government has
                                made it clear that it believed as a practical matter that the
                                Bolivian Government would find it difficult because of public
                                opinion in Bolivia to accept the Argentine conciliation formula
                                unless the fact were emphasized that this formula was supported
                                whole-heartedly by the Governments of Brazil and of the United
                                States. Furthermore, the expressed desire of this Government that,
                                should a confidential agreement in principle upon the bases proposed
                                be reached between Bolivia and Paraguay, all of the other republics
                                of the continent be invited to join with the Government of
                                Argentina, Brazil and the United States in the presentation of such
                                a formula to the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay should
                                undoubtedly be an additional inducement to the Bolivian Government
                                to adopt a favorable attitude with regard to the proposal. The
                                Governments of Brazil and of the United States are in accord that
                                they should be willing to take an active part in any friendly and
                                helpful manner which the Bolivian Government may deem desirable in
                                any negotiations which may ensue for the purpose of reaching a
                                definitive agreement, whether now or in Buenos Aires. You should
                                emphasize the above facts so far as in your judgment may be
                                desirable in discussing the questions at issue with the Bolivian
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>This Government has further taken the view and has so stated both to
                                the Argentine Government as well as to Brazilian Government that the
                                Bolivian Government should be given the fullest opportunity to make
                                such suggestions as it may deem desirable with regard to
                                modification of the articles of the formula submitted to it so long
                                as such suggested modifications would not impair the essential
                                nature of the conciliation formula. You may likewise make such
                                discreet use of this information in your conversations with the

                                United States and only on Saturday to Bolivia, hence some days will
                                be necessary for a reply and when sent this Legation will be
                                informed of it. He also called attention to the proposal of
                                President of Bolivia for an inter-American Congress (to the
                                Peru-Colombia invitation) an idea which is not abandoned, and wishes
                                to know whether the United States does not approve that proposal and
                                does not consider it better to place the Chaco question under other
                                auspices than those of Argentina.</p>

                            <p>101. Referring to Department’s No. 66, July 17, 4[<hi rend="italic"
                                    >6</hi>] p.m., I last night communicated substance of first
                                paragraph of Department’s telegram No. 66, July 17, 4 [<hi
                                    rend="italic">6</hi>] p.m., to the Argentine Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs who expressed his satisfaction thereat. At the same
                                time I also brought out the essential points contained in the second
                                paragraph with which the Minister said he was in substantial accord
                                adding that in this whole matter he was without prepossession,
                                seeking only the goal of peace. I then made known to the Minister
                                our Government’s feelings and desires as set forth in the concluding
                                paragraph of the Department’s telegram.</p>
                            <p>Doctor Saavedra Lamas told me that he had received a reply from the
                                President of Bolivia that was indefinite in its terms and that a
                                more considered answer was promised after the departure of the
                                President of Ecuador who is now visiting Bolivia. This provisional
                                    <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0221"/>response, said the
                                Minister, was not entirely satisfactory since President Salamanca …
                                sought in it to link acceptance of the formula to certain
                                engagements by Paraguay (such as a port on the Upper Paraguay) which
                                the Minister said he had hastened to point out was against the
                                spirit of his plan which sought to bring the parties together for
                                reconciliation, then to proceed to the adjustment of
                                differences.</p>
                            <p>The Minister further said that he was beginning to think that perhaps
                                the time was now ripe to give publicity to the matter in order to
                                exert the power of all American public opinion on [Bolivia];<note

                            <p>12. Your 41, July 19, noon, and 42, July 19, 6 p.m. It is deemed
                                desirable that you make it clear in your next conversation with the
                                Minister of Foreign Affairs that the copy of the Argentine formula
                                was received by this Department on Saturday, July 14, the same date
                                upon which it was presented to the Bolivian Government. It is the
                                understanding of the Department that the document was transmitted to
                                the Brazilian Government at identically the same time that it was
                                delivered to the Government of the United States. It is obvious that
                                the Minister is under a misapprehension when he states that it is
                                his understanding that the Argentine proposal was presented “long
                                ago” to Brazil and the United States.</p>
                            <p>You should further state at the earliest opportunity that throughout
                                the months which have passed since the time of the holding of the
                                Montevideo conference, this Government has constantly exerted its
                                best efforts to further the presentation of a peace proposal to
                                Bolivia and Paraguay which could be considered as a fair and
                                reasonable proposal, one equally honorable to both countries, and
                                one which contained the principle of a resort to arbitration should
                                conciliation unfortunately prove impracticable. The Government of
                                the United States believes that the Bolivian Government will readily
                                appreciate the fact that in its earnest desire to promote
                                satisfactory bases for peace, the Government of the United States
                                was primarily concerned with the nature of the proposal itself and
                                not with its source.</p>
                            <p>If the Government of the United States had failed to express its
                                earnest hope that a fair and reasonable proposal be accepted by both
                                the governments at war, it would have considered itself derelict in
                                its moral obligation as an impartial friend now as always of both
                                Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>You should further make very clear the feeling of this Government
                                that the action taken by Argentina and the proposal that the site of
                                the proposed conciliation conference be Buenos Aires does not in any
                                sense imply that the question is placed under the auspices of
                                Argentina. The participation of both Brazil and the United States in
                                the discussions which have now commenced and the firm desire of both
                                Brazil and the United States that all the other nations of the
                                continent support the peace proposal should it be agreed to in
                                principle by Bolivia and Paraguay, should be regarded as convincing
                                proof that the solution of the question is not to be left to the
                                “sole auspices of Argentina.” If the Bolivian Government will bear
                                these significant facts in mind, the Government of the United States
                                hopes that <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0223"/>it will concern
                                itself with the consideration of the nature of the formula presented
                                to its study and no longer attribute any material importance to the
                                points indicated in the latter half of the second paragraph of your
                                41.</p>
                            <p>With reference to this Government’s attitude as regards the
                                Colombian-Peruvian invitation, you should limit yourself to stating
                                that the Government of the United States applauded the initiative
                                taken in the interest of peace by those two Governments, but that in
                                view of the fact that both Brazil and Argentina had declined the
                                invitation and that Paraguay had refused to accept it, it seemed
                                very clear to this Government that noble as the initiative might be,
                                a satisfactory outcome could hardly be anticipated under these
                                conditions and that consequently it was felt that any determination
                                by the United States as to the acceptance of the invitation had
                                better be postponed.</p>

                            <p>68. Your 101, July 19, 1 p.m. Please tell Dr. Saavedra Lamas that the
                                views he has been good enough to send us both through your cable
                                under reference and through the Argentine Ambassador in Washington
                                this morning, have been received with the utmost satisfaction and
                                that we have given them the most careful study. Tell him,
                                furthermore, that we find ourselves whole-heartedly in sympathy with
                                the broadminded approach which he is demonstrating in his efforts to
                                secure peace. With the specific opinions which he expresses relating
                                to the cooperation of all the American republics and to the
                                reasonable elasticity of the conciliation formula presented, we are
                                in complete accord. You should point out to him, however, that we
                                fear very much that were the formula now to be made public as is
                                intimated in the last paragraph of your cable under reference, it
                                might be exceedingly difficult to obtain the subsequent cooperation
                                of certain other republics in supporting that formula before the
                                Government of Bolivia. We are strongly of the opinion that the best
                                method of insuring success of the initiative which Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas has undertaken is to attempt to obtain the confidential
                                acceptance by the Bolivian Government of the principles involved in
                                the formula and then confidentially seek the cooperation of the
                                other republics of the continent in presenting such formula
                                officially to the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay before
                                publicity is given to it. We are primarily concerned with the
                                success of the movement initiated by Dr. Saavedra Lamas in obtaining
                                peace, and in our judgment continental <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154"
                                    facs="0224"/>public opinion can be more successfully rallied in
                                favor of the formula if the Governments of the other American
                                republics are called upon for their cooperation before the formula
                                is made public than if they are requested to lend their support to a
                                formula of peace already made public.</p>
                            <p>For your strictly confidential information, the reference to the
                                Chilean Government in the last paragraph of your cable<note n="8"
                                    xml:id="d197fn8">See <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi></note> is not
                                clear. It is most earnestly to be hoped that the Chilean Government
                                will urge the Bolivian Government to accept the formula presented,
                                but the Department has been confidentially informed by the Chilean
                                Government that it is under the impression that it has been
                                rigorously excluded from these peace negotiations and it has
                                intimated that if this policy is persisted in the negotiations will
                                necessarily prove unsuccessful. The Chilean Government has been
                                urged to press upon the Bolivian Government the desirability of
                                accepting the formula and it has been emphasized that the Chilean
                                Government will, of course, be requested to cooperate with the other
                                American governments as soon as some confidential agreement in
                                principle has been reached.</p>
                            <p>Please cable the Department at an early opportunity whether you
                                understand that Dr. Saavedra Lamas has approached the Chilean
                                Government in the matter.</p>

                                therein. He seemed deeply gratified by the Department’s sympathetic
                                attitude and emphasized his general accord with the Department’s
                                views adding that his suggestion of publicity was meant only as a
                                last resort in the event of a flat refusal by either of the
                                countries concerned to accept his formula. He considers secrecy as
                                vital at the present stage of the negotiations.</p>
                            <p>He showed me a telegram just received from his Minister in La Paz
                                informing him that the American Minister there had returned [<hi
                                    rend="italic">received?</hi>] instructions from his Government
                                “that he insist on the acceptance of the formula by Bolivia”, the
                                Argentine Minister at La Paz adding that the Bolivian Government saw
                                no objection to Buenos Aires as the place of meeting for the
                                conciliation group.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Minister also showed me a long message received Friday or
                                Saturday from his Ambassador in Rio the latter stating that the
                                Brazilian Government was perturbed by press despatches concerning
                                peace negotiations and submitting from the Brazilian Foreign Office
                                a suggested communiqué to the press tacitly admitting that
                                negotiations were going on. The Argentine Ambassador in Rio was
                                concerned over the whole matter fearing a repercussion in Chilean
                                Government circles. The Foreign Minister’s reply to his Ambassador
                                was to the effect that he would deprecate publication of such a
                                statement saying it would … kill the negotiations.…</p>
                            <p>Referring to the concluding sentence of the Department’s telegram No.
                                68 the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Chilean Ambassador
                                    <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0226"/>here had quite recently
                                called on him to ask for information; that he had informed the
                                Ambassador that “exploratory conversations” had been negotiated by
                                him with the two Governments at war; that a natural modesty had
                                restrained him from discussing the matter with Chile when there was
                                a chance of a second rebuff by one or the other of the combatants;
                                that of course it had always been his idea promptly to inform the
                                Chilean Government as soon as something like an understanding had
                                been reached; and that the Ambassador was empowered to inform his
                                Government to the foregoing effect. The Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                said he had told the Ambassador nothing of the formula.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he had been also approached by
                                the Peruvian Ambassador here and had replied in the above sense to
                                him with permission to inform his Government.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the position of Argentina
                                before the League of Nations was a delicate one as it was a member
                                of the Council and that he had instructed his Minister at Bern to
                                inform the League of these exploratory conversations.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that in the case
                                of Bolivia he feared two things, first, a premature and
                                ill-considered reply which might be explicitly in the negative, and
                                second, the linking of acceptance of the formula to certain
                                engagements by Paraguay (the latter as suggested in my number 101 of
                                July 19, 1 p.m.) and by an insistence on arbitration.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">La Paz</hi>, July 24, 1934. Please inform that
                                Chancery that we have received its new suggestion for the pacific
                                arrangement of the Chaco with equal deference to its previous ones
                                and that we are disposed to consider it with the same sincere spirit
                                as in the other occasions. We would have desired, however, that
                                before it was concretely made into an official formula that we had
                                been consulted previously and confidentially. Thus was the procedure
                                in the case of the Antokoletz plan which we accepted deferentially
                                and which Paraguay rejected, without there having remained of that
                                rejection any other proof than the confidential information which
                                you received from the Argentine Chancery. In such a situation we are

                                copy of the reply addressed by the Government of Bolivia to the
                                Argentine Government.<note n="12" xml:id="d202fn12">See <hi

                            <p>Please obtain an interview with Dr. Saavedra Lamas at the earliest
                                opportunity and advise him that this Government would appreciate
                                having his views concerning this reply. You should state that we are
                                addressing a similar inquiry to the Government of Brazil.</p>
                            <p>In your conversation you may say that while, of course, the reply is
                                not as satisfactory as could have been hoped for, this Government
                                nevertheless believes that a favorable opportunity is now presented
                                for pressing forward with the conciliation formula.</p>
                            <p>The Minister of Bolivia in Washington has given it as his personal
                                opinion that the reply should be construed as an acceptance in
                                principle of the Argentine proposal and this Government believes
                                that it would be helpful to consider it as such. It is hoped that
                                Dr. Saavedra Lamas will see no objection to agreeing to the request
                                made by Bolivia that Chile, Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Mexico, and
                                Cuba be invited by Argentina, Brazil and the United States to join
                                with these three governments in presenting and in supporting the
                                conciliation formula <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0228"/>of Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas. It would seem that this step would not only be in
                                accord with the opinion already expressed to us by the Argentine and
                                Brazilian Governments, but that it would at once rally to the
                                support of the conciliation formula the continental public opinion
                                desired by Dr. Saavedra Lamas as indicated in his recent messages to
                                this Government. Such general support of the conciliation formula
                                would have a very great moral weight. Compliance with this request
                                of the Bolivian Government would also unquestionably have a calming
                                effect upon public opinion in Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>If Dr. Saavedra Lamas coincides with this belief as above expressed,
                                it is hoped that he will be willing to make the utmost endeavors to
                                obtain the consent of Paraguay, and in such event, the American
                                Minister in Asunción will be instructed to support most earnestly
                                such representations.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the additional request of Bolivia that the Argentine
                                Goverment ascertain whether the Government of Paraguay would be
                                willing to agree upon more concrete bases of conciliation,
                                specifying as one of them that the right of Bolivia to a zone along
                                the River Paraguay from Bahía Negra south be recognized, in the
                                opinion of this Government it would seem to be very clear that these
                                points are precisely those which should be taken up for the most
                                ample and careful consideration in the conciliation conversations
                                and it is suggested that if the nations above mentioned accept the
                                invitation to participate in presenting the conciliation formula to
                                Bolivia, they might then appropriately be requested to join in
                                urging upon Bolivia the desirability of instructing the Bolivian
                                plenipotentiaries in the conciliation proceedings to present these
                                points as representing the Bolivian point of view. All of the
                                Governments involved might further appropriately state that the
                                Bolivian Government’s requests will, of course, be given the most
                                friendly consideration during the conciliation proceedings.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion please state to Dr. Saavedra Lamas that the views above
                                expressed are transmitted to him confidentially and that no official
                                intimation will be given to the Government of Bolivia of the
                                attitude of the Government of the United States with regard to the
                                Bolivian reply until after we have had the fullest opportunity for
                                consultation with Argentina and Brazil.</p>

                            <p>90. Please advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this
                                Government received last night from the Bolivian Minister in
                                Washington <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0229"/>a copy of the
                                reply sent by the Bolivian Government to the Argentine proposal for
                                the settlement of the Chaco dispute.</p>
                            <p>Please state that this Government would welcome at the earliest
                                possible opportunity such observations as the Brazilian Government
                                may be good enough to send it concerning this matter.</p>
                            <p>You may state that we believe it would be very helpful if the request
                                of the Bolivian Government that Chile, Peru, Colombia, Uruguay,
                                Mexico, and Cuba be invited to join with Argentina, Brazil, and the
                                United States in presenting this formula to the Bolivian Government
                                be acceded to. It is felt that the cooperation of these important
                                nations of this continent in supporting this move for peace would
                                coincide with the views previously expressed to the Argentine
                                Government by both Brazil and the United States and that the
                                beneficial effect of the moral support of these additional countries
                                would be very great. It would further have the helpful effect of
                                calming public opinion in Bolivia and in making easier an unreserved
                                acceptance of the peace proposal by the Bolivian Government.</p>
                            <p>If the Brazilian and the Argentine Governments were to share our
                                views in the matter, it is believed that the Argentine Government
                                might well urge the acceptance of this proposal upon Paraguay and
                                the Brazilian and American Ministers in Asunción should in that
                                event be instructed to support such representations.</p>
                            <p>In the latter portion of the Bolivian reply the Bolivian Government
                                requests the Argentine Government to inquire whether Paraguay would
                                support more concrete bases for conciliation, mentioning
                                specifically the recognition of the right of Bolivia to a zone of
                                territory along the River Paraguay from Bahía Negra south. It would
                                seem that these questions might more appropriately be dealt with in
                                the proposed conciliation conversations, and if all the governments
                                above mentioned agree to support the conciliation formula, it might
                                well be suggested to them that all of the nations concerned unite in
                                urging upon Bolivia that these matters might more appropriately be
                                dealt with in the conciliation conference at which time all of the
                                friendly nations involved would, of course, make every effort to see
                                that all reasonable and fair proposals offered by Bolivia should be
                                given the most ample and friendly consideration.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion please state to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that
                                we are likewise consulting with the Argentine Government and that we
                                will give no official intimation of any views held by this
                                Government to Bolivia until after we have had the benefit of
                                receiving such observations as Brazil and Argentina may make to
                                us.</p>

                            <p>150. Department’s 90, July 26, 9 p.m. Minister of Foreign Affairs has
                                practically suspended operations until after the week-end. The new
                                Minister whom I saw this afternoon has read none of the telegrams
                                and is not familiar with the question. The Secretary General has
                                left and no successor has taken over.</p>
                            <p>I discussed the matter with a well informed junior official who will
                                try to get the Minister to read the telegrams tomorrow and give me
                                some answer which I can report but I hardly expect to have anything
                                dependable before Monday.</p>

                            <p>107. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 70, July 26, 9 p.m. On
                                July 26 and before receipt of the Department’s telegraphic
                                instructions referred to I had called on the Foreign Minister at his
                                request when he handed me a copy of the note from the Bolivian
                                Minister in this city with the request that I transmit it to you. At
                                this time the Minister showed me a telegram dated July 25 from his
                                Minister in Santiago stating that the Chilean Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs was deeply interested in his peace efforts and that he could
                                count on the cooperation of Chile whose policy was one of accord
                                with Argentina in securing peace. He told me that he had also been
                                advised in a similar sense by the Peruvian Ambassador here. The
                                Foreign Minister again emphasized the necessity for extreme secrecy
                                toward Chile and Peru as to the existence of a definite formula,
                                reiterating that he had told them that his efforts were in the
                                nature of exploratory conversations and that for this reason he had
                                not asked them to take any steps at La Paz lest the fact that there
                                was a formula be developed. The Minister further told me that he was
                                not advising Ambassador Espil of Bolivia’s reply.</p>
                            <p>Promptly on receipt of the Department’s telegram No. 70 I arranged an
                                interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs calling on him this
                                morning and went over with him the points contained in the
                                Department’s telegram. Referring to the fourth paragraph he said
                                that he was doubtful if we should give much weight to the favorable
                                    <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0231"/>interpretation of the
                                Bolivian reply given by the Bolivian Minister in Washington.</p>
                            <p>He is in general accord with the idea of the collaboration of the
                                other countries named in presenting and supporting his formula but
                                was reluctant to say what steps he would take to start this
                                machinery. I rather pushed him on this and he finally said that he
                                would “explore the matter with Paraguay” but before doing this it
                                was highly desirable to arouse Brazil to greater activity. I
                                inquired if he anticipated any change in Brazil’s attitude under the
                                new Foreign Minister.<note n="13" xml:id="d205fn13">José Carlos de

                                negative; that this official was a well poised pacific man, and had
                                represented Brazil in the Disarmament Conference.<note n="14"

                                precaution with Brazil is necessary because that Government does not
                                wish to act strongly until there is definite acceptance of the
                                formula by the two Governments. I reiterated the desire of my
                                Government to support his efforts at Asunción when he thought the
                                moment propitious. With regard to the additional request of Bolivia,
                                paragraph 6 of the Department’s telegram under reference, he said
                                that he thought of expressing his great surprise thereat to the
                                Bolivian representative since it was something that could be
                                discussed in conciliation conversations and that the fact that this
                                was confidentially advanced as a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>
                                indicated that Bolivia would be afraid to have brought out publicly
                                that it had laid down such a condition. He added that if the zone
                                were insisted upon he would end the whole matter.</p>
                            <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                            <p>The Minister showed me a telegram from his representative at Geneva
                                reporting that he had informed the League of Nations of the
                                exploratory conversations and quoting their expressions of
                                satisfaction thereat. He added that when the League reassembled in
                                September the Argentine position before it would be entirely
                                regularized.</p>
                            <p>The Minister referred to shipments of arms from the United States and
                                said he was uncertain of the repercussion in Paraguay but that he
                                hoped for one not unduly unfavorable. Following this he said: “Your
                                country must push Bolivia since you have the means to do it.” To
                                this I made no reply.</p>
                            <p>At the beginning, during, and at the conclusion of our conversation,
                                the Minister counseled extreme patience and great deliberation,
                                insisting that in the whole matter we must go slowly since this was
                                a last effort and we must avoid defeat, that we must have Brazil
                                strongly supporting the effort, and that there must be perfect
                                accord with that Government.…</p>

                            <p>The Minister asked me for a résumé of the Department’s message and I
                                replied that I was not authorized to do so. He did not press the
                                matter further. I request your instructions on this point.</p>

                            <p>109. Supplementing my No. 107, July 28, 6 p.m. The Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs told me today that he had just given messages for
                                the President of Paraguay to the Paraguayan Minister in Brazil who
                                is leaving here tomorrow for Asunción.</p>
                            <p>He is obviously anxious to accomplish something definite before the
                                League Council meeting in September next. He remarked that it would
                                be difficult for Argentina to disassociate itself from League <pb

                                Council had met. I gather that he is now inclined to think an
                                endeavor should be made to get Paraguay and Bolivia to agree on an
                                arbitral compromise (if conciliation should prove ineffective)
                                within a 1–month period rather than the 3 months specified in
                                paragraph 7 of his conciliation formula.</p>

                            <p>73. By instruction of his Government, the Bolivian Minister in

                                reply to the Argentine proposal that the statement made by Bolivia
                                in the latter part of her reply, to the effect that Bolivia must be
                                given an outlet to the Paraguay River as a <hi rend="italic">sine

                                and is not to be considered in any sense as a condition imposed for
                                participation by Bolivia in the Conciliation Conference;
                                furthermore, that this statement had reference solely to the
                                Conciliation Conference and not to arbitration and that Bolivia
                                would agree to arbitration in the broadest sense by the Permanent
                                Court at The Hague.</p>
                            <p>This information, which appears to be highly satisfactory, as an
                                evidence of Bolivia’s willingness to participate in conciliation
                                negotiations and to agree to arbitration if conciliation proves
                                impracticable, has been communicated confidentially to the Argentine

                            <p>96. Your 155 August 3, 6 p.m. The Brazilian Chargé d’Affaires
                                communicated yesterday evening to the Department an inquiry similar
                                to that addressed to you by the Brazilian Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs. The Brazilian Chargé d’Affaires was advised of the deep
                                appreciation of this Government for the attitude shown by the
                                Brazilian Government in consulting with the Government of the United
                                States and was further told that the views of this Government had
                                already been made known both to the Argentine and Brazilian
                                Governments in prior communications. In the opinion of this
                                Government, Brazil and the United States have cooperated with
                                Argentina in the interest of the advancement of peace between
                                Bolivia and Paraguay by lending their strong moral support to the
                                conciliation formula presented to the Bolivian Government by the
                                Government of Argentina. We believe that for practical
                                considerations it may be well to limit the nations cooperating with
                                Argentina in the peace movement to Brazil and the United States
                                until a definite agreement in principle on the bases of the
                                conciliation formula has been obtained both from Bolivia and from
                                Paraguay. We further believe, however, that as soon as such definite
                                acceptance of principle has been obtained from both Governments, it
                                would be highly advantageous to request the formal cooperation of
                                the other American Republics referred to by Bolivia in her reply in
                                presenting and supporting officially the conciliation formula to the
                                two belligerent nations. It was our clear understanding that the
                                Argentine Government coincided in this point of view as was made
                                evident in conversations had with Dr. Saavedra Lamas by the American
                                Ambassador at Buenos Aires, as well as in messages received by the
                                Argentine Ambassador at Washington from his Government.</p>
                            <p>The following are the reasons for the opinion held by this Government
                                in the matter: <list>

                                    <item>The influence of Chile in Bolivia is momentarily
                                        preponderant and unless Chile is invited to participate in
                                        the peace negotiations, it seems very probable that those
                                        negotiations may not be successful.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>It would be exceedingly difficult for the United States,
                                        in view of its failure to cooperate in the recent initiative
                                        of Colombia and <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0235"
                                        />Peru, to refrain from requesting those Governments to
                                        cooperate in this new peace move.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>
                                    <item>Mexico, Uruguay, and Cuba, which formed part of the
                                        Commission of Neutrals at Washington, would necessarily
                                        resent the failure of this Government to invite them to
                                        participate in any new peace movement.</item>
                                    <label>4.</label>
                                    <item>This Government is decidedly of the opinion and has
                                        frequently so stated, that the furtherance of peace on the
                                        American Continent should be a matter of joint moral
                                        responsibility for all of the American Republics and does
                                        not believe that efforts in behalf of peace should be
                                        limited to any bloc or clique of American Republics. The
                                        latter procedure would be more likely to promote ill feeling
                                        than to further peace, particularly under present
                                        conditions. The precedent involved in this instance is one
                                        which this Government attributes the highest
                                        importance.</item>
                                    <label>5.</label>
                                    <item>Finally, it is well known by Argentina, Brazil, and the
                                        United States that Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ conciliation formula
                                        had been presented to Paraguay and had apparently received
                                        its full approval before it was presented to the Government
                                        of Bolivia. The only specific request upon which Bolivia has
                                        continued to insist since its reply was sent to Argentina is
                                        that the additional American Republics under reference be
                                        invited to participate in the mediation. If this request is
                                        not complied with, it would appear to be very difficult for
                                        Bolivia to agree to the peace formula.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>For the reasons above set forth, this Government believes that if an
                                agreement in principle between Paraguay and Bolivia can be obtained,
                                the additional American Republics should be at once invited to
                                participate in presenting the conciliation formula to both
                                belligerents. There seems to be no reason for extending this
                                invitation immediately, since we have no information leading us to
                                believe that the final acquiescence in principle by Paraguay has as
                                yet been obtained by the Argentine Government.</p>

                            <p>160. Department’s 96, August 4, 2 p.m. I had on my own responsibility
                                already outlined the substance of the Department’s views but was
                                glad to be able to confirm them by reading your telegram to the
                                Foreign Minister this afternoon. He was obviously gratified.</p>
                            <p>He informed me (1) that he had today sent the Brazilian Chargé
                                d’Affaires in Washington a telegram outlining substantially the same
                                views in regard to this question so that there was no doubt of our
                                complete understanding.</p>
                            <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0236"/>
                            <p>(2) That he was today sending a telegram to the Brazilian Ambassador
                                in Buenos Aires instructing him to confer with his American
                                colleague and in full understanding with him to inform Mr. Saavedra
                                Lamas definitely that Brazil was in favor of extending the
                                invitation to include the nine powers.</p>
                            <p>(3) That he was about to hand the Argentine Ambassador here a
                                memorandum informing him that (once the Argentine formula had been
                                accepted by the two parties) Brazil was definitely in favor of
                                inviting the other powers in question to join in the work of
                                conciliation. He stresses as the essential argument the fact that
                                after proclaiming peace on this continent to be a matter of general
                                American concern, any attempt to retain control by the three powers
                                might well be regarded as an effort on their part to dominate
                                affairs in this hemisphere. As I understood it he contented himself
                                with that one argument.</p>
                            <p>(4) The Chilean Ambassador had just handed him a memorandum
                                containing the text of the note addressed to the Paraguayan
                                Government announcing the withdrawal of the Chilean Minister.<note
                                    n="16" xml:id="d211fn16">See section entitled “Concern of the
                                    United States Over Misunderstanding Between Chile and Paraguay

                                As I assume the Department will receive this from the Chilean
                                Ambassador in Washington I shall not telegraph the text unless so
                                instructed.</p>
                            <p>It is felt here that this action is regrettable as at a time when all
                                efforts should be centered on conciliation Chile has created a fresh
                                complication which does not facilitate her being asked to serve as a
                                conciliator. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made no carefully
                                formulated comments to the Chilean Ambassador but stressed the
                                desirability of forbearance and moderation in the general interest
                                and expressed the hope that a definite rupture would be avoided.</p>
                            <p>(5) Some annoyance was expressed at what was considered a rather
                                crude effort on the part of the Argentine to get Brazil to espouse
                                the Argentine point of view and thus face the United States with the
                                choice of acquiescing or being made responsible for the
                                consequences. I cannot judge as to the foundation for this belief
                                but it seems clearly to have made the Brazilians more determined to
                                stick to their guns.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion the Minister once more stressed the point that he sees
                                eye to eye with us in the present situation and having full
                                confidence in our singleness of purpose he is anxious to be kept as
                                fully informed as possible in order that he may effectively support
                                what we are trying to accomplish.</p>

                                <item>Please express to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the great
                                    satisfaction occasioned this Government upon ascertaining that
                                    the views of the Brazilian Government with regard to procedure
                                    in the Chaco peace negotiations appear identical with the views
                                    held by this Government. A similar response was made this
                                    morning to the Brazilian Chargé d’Affaires in Washington.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>This Government is deeply concerned by the threatened break in
                                    relations between Chile and Paraguay. Both because of the fact
                                    that a final break in relations would materially impede the
                                    pacific solution of the Chaco controversy as well as because of
                                    the consequent unfavorable effect on relations between Chile and
                                    Argentina, it seems exceedingly desirable that a strong effort
                                    be made without delay to avert this possibility. Should the
                                    Government of Brazil view the situation, and the possible
                                    dangers inherent therein, in the same manner in which this
                                    Government regards them, it would seem desirable for both
                                    Governments to inquire through their respective missions in
                                    Santiago and in Asunción whether the Governments of Chile and
                                    Paraguay would care to avail themselves of the friendly offices
                                    of Brazil and the United States in attempting to find a solution
                                    of the difficulties which have arisen between them agreeable to
                                    both Governments concerned.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>If any steps in this sense are to be taken, they should obviously be
                                taken immediately. Please cable the views of the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs at the earliest opportunity.</p>

                            <p>167. 1. Foreign Office advises me that Saavedra Lamas has agreed that
                                once formula is accepted in principle the six other powers will be
                                invited. They are now going on the assumption that this is a
                                definite acceptance of our point of view.</p>
                            <p>2. Brazilian Ambassador at Santiago, who has instructions to act as

                            <p>103. Your 167, August 9, 7 p.m. Referring to your Paragraph 1, this
                                Government now understands that the Argentine, Brazilian, and United
                                States Governments are in accord that the other six powers will be
                                invited once the conciliation formula has been definitely accepted
                                in principle by Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>With reference to Paragraph 2 of your cable, the American Ambassador
                                at Santiago received instructions in the evening of August 8,<note
                                    n="17" xml:id="d214fn17"><hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_306">p. 306</ref>.</note> and carried them out
                                before midnight on that date. He has informed the Department that
                                the Chilean Government has suggested that the United States, acting
                                either alone or in conjunction with Brazil and Argentina, endeavor
                                to persuade Paraguay to make a statement (1) that Paraguay considers
                                as unfounded the personal attacks appearing in the Paraguayan press
                                upon the President and members of the Government of Chile; and (2)
                                that “Paraguay has complete confidence in the fidelity of Chile
                                towards its obligations as a neutral.” Dr. Cruchaga added that if
                                the latter point could not be obtained, he was open minded to any
                                alternative plan which this Government might suggest.</p>
                            <p>The Department has not as yet received any response from the
                                Government of Paraguay to the inquiry made of it in terms identical
                                to that made in Santiago.</p>
                            <p>The Department is advised by the Argentine Ambassador of the efforts
                                being made by Dr. Saavedra Lamas to prevent a rupture of relations
                                between Chile and Paraguay, but is not as yet advised as to the
                                attitude adopted by Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>Referring to Paragraph 3 of your cable, the Department approves of
                                your repeating pertinent telegrams to American Embassy at Buenos
                                Aires for its information.</p>

                                states both Paraguay and Bolivia have accepted protocol in
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>2. Ambassador also reports that Ayala has just telephoned Saavedra
                                Lamas that he is instructing his Minister in Santiago to express to
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs his Government’s entire disapproval
                                of the press campaign which was a purely private matter.</p>
                            <p>3. Ayala informed Brazilian Minister at Asunción that in making
                                foregoing statement to the press tomorrow he proposed to add that
                                the Paraguayan Government still fully maintains its previous
                                assertion that Chile has been guilty of nonneutral conduct.</p>
                            <p>4. Brazilian Ambassador in Santiago reports that in conversation
                                Cruchaga affirms that he has no desire to humiliate Paraguay or
                                demand satisfaction which would be offensive to her national
                                pride.</p>
                            <p>5. Foreign Office telegraphing Brazilian Minister at Asunción
                                instructions to act with his American colleague to persuade Ayala to
                                defer or preferably refrain from making press statement which could
                                only make matters worse suggesting to him the alternative of
                                instructing his Minister in Santiago to call upon Cruchaga when
                                expressing verbally the Paraguayan Government’s regrets at the press
                                campaign to affirm Paraguay’s confidence in the propriety of Chile’s
                                diplomatic action.</p>
                            <p>6. Foreign Office at the same time suggesting informally at Buenos
                                Aires, Santiago and Asunción that the notes exchanged between latter
                                two capitals be withdrawn with a view either to replacing them with
                                other notes in milder terms or to verbal adjustment.</p>
                            <p>7. The Foreign Office feels there is great urgency in this matter and
                                hopes you will feel justified in issuing appropriate instructions to
                                Nicholson.</p>

                                in the evening of August 9, by the Paraguayan Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs according to a cable received this morning from the American
                                Minister in Asunción. The pertinent portions are as follows: <list>
                                    <label>(1)</label>
                                    <item>The Paraguayan Government “maintains in full the
                                        statements in its note of August 2, as concerns the
                                        neutrality observed by the Chilean Government;</item>
                                    <label>(2)</label>
                                    <item>“That there cannot be given to the note” (that of August
                                        2) “any interpretation in the sense that the Government
                                        associates itself with the press propaganda and much less
                                        with the attacks of a personal character directed against
                                        Chilean personalities which attacks merit the Government’s
                                        frank reprobation.”</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>Point 2 clearly meets the desires of the Chilean Government, but
                                Point 1 is understood to be unacceptable. The Department
                                understands, however, that Dr. Saavedra Lamas believes that he has
                                obtained from President Ayala a conciliatory statement covering the
                                contents of Point 1 which will prove acceptable to the Chilean
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the Paraguayan statement has already been
                                issued and that Dr. Saavedra Lamas is optimistic as to the outcome
                                of his mediation, it would seem preferable temporarily to await
                                developments and for this Government to make no further
                                representations at this time to the Government of Paraguay. Further
                                instructions will be sent you upon receipt of precise information
                                from Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>You may advise the Foreign Office of the above and state that this
                                Government would have been very glad to join with the Government of
                                Brazil in suggesting to the Government of Paraguay that it refrain
                                from the publication of the official statement above referred to,
                                but that the speedy publication of this statement prevents any
                                action in the matter.</p>

                            <p>122. At the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I today met
                                with him and the Brazilian Ambassador at the Brazilian Embassy to
                                discuss the Chaco matter. The Bolivian Minister came in later. The
                                latter said that his Government was in accord with the general
                                principle of arbitration but that the Chaco as defined by Paraguay
                                before the League was not an acceptable basis, intimating strongly
                                    <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0241"/>that the scope of the
                                arbitration should be first determined if Bolivia is to accept the
                                Argentine formula. He, however, expressed himself as highly pleased
                                with the outlook for peace. His general attitude would seem to be at
                                variance with the statements made to the Department by the Bolivian
                                Minister in Washington (see your No. 73, August 1, 6 p.m.).</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs feels that the crux of the matter is
                                the willingness of Bolivia to arbitrate in a broad spirit and he
                                hopes that further pressure can be brought on that Government to
                                this end.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Brazilian Ambassador and I meet
                                again on Wednesday.</p>

                            <p>124. At the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs I again met
                                with him and the Brazilian Ambassador at the Brazilian Embassy
                                today. The Paraguayan Minister was present. The latter said that his
                                personal reactions to the Argentine formula for Chaco peace were
                                favorable but that of course he would like to consult his Government
                                and would later enter into contact with us.</p>
                            <p>At our specific request the Minister of Foreign Affairs later
                                informed the Brazilian Ambassador and myself privately that he had
                                the certainty of Paraguay’s acceptance of his formula.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me a letter just received
                                from the Bolivian Minister saying he was instructed by his
                                Government to seek an immediate interview with Doctor Saavedra Lamas
                                and the Brazilian and American Ambassadors at which he might set
                                forth the exact views of his Government concerning the peace formula
                                in order to avoid any misunderstanding. He is being invited to meet
                                us at the Brazilian Embassy tomorrow afternoon.</p>

                                bases for the conciliation although apparently Paraguay now declares

                            <p>126. As previously arranged I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                                the Bolivian Minister and the Brazilian Ambassador, at the latter’s
                                residence yesterday afternoon.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister read to us his Government’s reply to the
                                Argentine Government referred to in the Department’s No. 70, July
                                26, 9 p.m. I pointed out that this had been qualified by
                                declarations made to the Department (see your No. 73, August 1, 6
                                p.m.); the Minister for Foreign Affairs corroborated this referring
                                to similar advices received from his Ambassador in Washington; the
                                Brazilian Ambassador said these statements also accorded with his
                                own information.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister then read a telegram from his Government dated
                                August 15 to the effect that it had understood that conciliation
                                would come first with arbitration as a last resort and not as a
                                prerequisite and that in the present circumstances it must advance
                                as a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> an outlet on the Paraguay
                                River, insinuating that the <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0243"
                                />United States, Argentina and Brazil should ascertain Paraguay’s
                                claims and then endeavor to reconcile the two. He continued to
                                insist that his Government was in accord with the principles of the
                                Argentine formula but that a “method” for conciliation must be
                                worked out and that until such conciliation procedure was arrived at
                                no progress could be made toward arbitration. This seemed to
                                deadlock discussion and the Bolivian Minister withdrew saying he
                                would again consult his Government and later ask for another
                                interview.</p>
                            <p>The Brazilian Ambassador, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I are
                                at one in considering that Bolivia’s attitude as set forth above
                                represents a change of front from that previously made known to us
                                and a return to its original position.</p>

                            <p>176. Bolivian Minister today left memorandum at Foreign Office
                                stating his country makes Paraguayan recognition of Bolivian zone on
                                Paraguay River (from Bahía Negra south) a fundamental condition
                                precedent to acceptance of formula. In other words they want to add
                                an eighth point to formula.</p>
                            <p>Memorandum adds that Bolivian Government understands hostilities
                                shall cease immediately on acceptance of all points by both
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs is telegraphing Brazilian Ambassador at
                                Buenos Aires expressing annoyance at the apparent discrepancy
                                between statements made by Saavedra Lamas to the mediating countries
                                on the one hand and the contending countries on the other hand, a
                                course which may lead to serious complications. Ambassador is
                                instructed to confer with Weddell with a view to concerted action in
                                urging Saavedra Lamas to exert pressure on Paraguay to adhere to
                                previous acceptance of formula.</p>
                            <p>Minister for Foreign Affairs would value an expression of your views
                                on this subject and on the attitude to be adopted in dealing with

                            <p>127. As previously arranged I this afternoon met the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs and the Brazilian Ambassador.</p>
                            <p>At this meeting we received a note dated today addressed to the three
                                of us by the Paraguayan Minister in this city quoting in full the
                                Argentine peace formula and accepting the same “without
                                reservations” in the name of his Government. Copies by next air mail
                                unless otherwise instructed.</p>
                            <p>It was felt that the fact of Paraguay’s acceptance would be most
                                confidential to our respective Governments and should not be
                                communicated to the Bolivian Government.</p>

                            <p>128. Supplementing my 127, August 17, 6 p.m., at yesterday’s meeting
                                it was felt by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Brazilian
                                Ambassador and myself, that as this seemed a critical moment in the
                                negotiations each of us should suggest to our governments that
                                pressure be now brought on the Bolivian Government to accept
                                unreservedly the Argentine formula, the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                to give corresponding instructions to his own diplomatic
                                representative in La Paz. I postponed advising you of above until I
                                received oral confirmation from Brazilian Ambassador that he was
                                sending a similar message to his Government.</p>

                                accepting the same without reservations in the name of his
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>In view of the action thus taken by Paraguay there would seem to be
                                no further reason for questioning the full acceptance by Paraguay of

                            <p>With reference to the first paragraph of your cable and to the
                                request of the Brazilian Government for an expression of our views
                                thereon, the statements made by the Bolivian Minister in Rio de
                                Janeiro in the memorandum to which you refer appear to be at
                                variance with statements made to the Department by the Bolivian
                                Minister in Washington. The latter has stated that the outlet to the
                                Paraguay River insisted upon by Bolivia is a condition essential to
                                a satisfactory agreement between Bolivia and Paraguay through
                                conciliation, but that it is not an indispensable prerequisite to an
                                agreement to accept arbitration on the part of Bolivia. Please
                                state, therefore, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the
                                Department desires to clarify this apparent conflict before
                                expressing any final views on this subject.</p>
                            <p>For your confidential information, I am inclined to believe that more
                                satisfactory progress will be made if Brazil and the United States
                                at this stage of the negotiations were to endeavor to obtain a
                                definitive statement of her attitude from Bolivia, the Argentine
                                Government doing the same with regard to Paraguay, with a
                                simultaneous endeavor on the part of Argentina, Brazil, and the
                                United States to attempt to conciliate the respective points of view
                                of the belligerent governments. At the present time there seems to
                                be considerable discrepancy in the statements made by Bolivia at
                                Buenos Aires and the statements made at Rio and at Washington and it
                                might be more practical to suggest next week to Dr. Saavedra Lamas
                                that the procedure above indicated be temporarily adopted. The
                                Department will cable you definite instructions on this point early
                                next week.</p>

                            <p>91. Your 128, August 18, 10 a.m. For your personal and confidential
                                information, the Argentine Ambassador here has received instructions
                                from Dr. Saavedra Lamas suggesting that the Ministers of Argentine,
                                Brazil, and the United States in La Paz be instructed to make joint
                                representations to the Bolivian Government expressing the surprise
                                of their respective Governments at the statements made by the
                                Bolivian Minister in Buenos Aires at the meeting of August 16th and
                                calling the attention of the Bolivian Government to the fact that
                                the said statements are in complete disaccord with prior statements
                                made by the diplomatic representatives of Bolivia and especially by
                                the Bolivian Minister in Washington, and that such a change in
                                attitude is inconceivable only 2 days after the present negotiations
                                have been commenced.</p>
                            <p>The instructions given the Argentine Ambassador here appear to be
                                quite different from the understanding reached at your conference
                                with Dr. Saavedra Lamas and the Brazilian Ambassador on August 17th
                                as reported in your cable above referred to, which understanding, as
                                you conveyed it, refers solely to bringing pressure to bear upon
                                Bolivia to accept without reservations the original conciliation
                                formula.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Ambassador has been informed that it does not appear to
                                this Government an opportune time to adopt an admonitory tone
                                towards Bolivia, since it appears to be very probable, in our
                                judgment, that the apparent discrepancies between the statements
                                made by the Bolivian Minister in Buenos Aires and those made by
                                other officials of the Bolivian Government are due in great part to
                                misunderstanding and perhaps to complication in procedure. The
                                Argentine Ambassador has been informed that the Department has,
                                however, already urged upon the Bolivian Government, through the <pb
                                    n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0247"/>Bolivian Minister here,
                                acceptance without reservation of the conciliation formula.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister in Washington this morning strongly reiterated
                                the prior statements he had made with regard to the attitude of his
                                Government towards conciliation and towards arbitration. He has
                                stated that the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of the outlet to
                                the River Paraguay refers solely to conciliation and was intended as
                                a friendly and confidential statement to the three mediating nations
                                of the point of view which Bolivia must maintain during the
                                conciliation conversations, if these took place. He has further
                                stated that unless the mediating powers were willing to propose this
                                during the course of the conciliation proceedings as an essential
                                part of the agreement to be arrived at, it would seem better to
                                resort immediately to arbitration, since Bolivia could not accept an
                                agreement through conciliation unless an outlet to the River
                                Paraguay formed a part of such agreement. The Minister was informed
                                in reply to this statement that it seemed logical that Bolivia
                                should first accept without reservations the conciliation formula
                                and then request the friendly support of the mediating powers for
                                her point of view if that were deemed reasonable and acceptable by
                                the mediating nations.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the question of arbitration, the Minister was reminded
                                that in the “reply of the Bolivian Government concerning the
                                Commission of the League of Nations draft treaty transmitted by the
                                Bolivian Plenipotentiary on March 6, 1934,” the Bolivian Government
                                reiterated its acceptance of the proposal of the Commission that
                                there be entrusted to the Permanent Court of International Justice
                                at The Hague legal arbitration to delimit the sovereignty of the two
                                contending countries over the territory included in the maximum
                                claims so far advanced by the belligerents in accordance with the
                                principles proclaimed by the American nations in their declaration
                                of August 3, 1932. The Department stated to the Minister that this
                                was understood as providing for ample arbitration. The Minister
                                replied that he understood that this was still the point of view
                                maintained by his Government, but that in order to ascertain if any
                                change had taken place in such point of view since March, last, he
                                would cable immediately and obtain an explicit confirmation of his
                                own impression. Upon receipt of this confirmation, the Department
                                will advise you accordingly.</p>
                            <p>It appears very obvious that many complications and misunderstandings
                                at this stage of negotiations are brought about by the endeavor of
                                Dr. Saavedra Lamas to negotiate directly with Bolivia and Paraguay
                                at the same time. This condition may perhaps be due in part to the
                                suspicion with which Bolivia views Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ activities
                                and to Bolivia’s continued belief that any suggestions made by Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas are to the advantage of Paraguay. It would <pb

                                conciliation conversations have definitely commenced, that Brazil
                                and the United States obtain, if possible, through direct
                                negotiations with Bolivia an agreement without reservation as to the
                                conciliation formula and a clear and definitive statement of
                                Bolivia’s position with respect to conciliation and with respect to
                                arbitration, and that the Argentine Government undertake the same
                                service with regard to Paraguay, the three mediating Governments
                                then attempting to reconcile such discrepancies as there may be in
                                the points of view of the belligerent nations through their
                                representatives in Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>Before definitely making the suggestion to Dr. Saavedra Lamas, the
                                Department desires you to cable your impression as to his probable
                                reactions to such a suggestion. It is understood that the Government
                                of Brazil will be favorably disposed to the procedure indicated.</p>

                            <p>110. Your 177, August 18, 2 p.m. The Department has urged the
                                Bolivian Government, through the Bolivian Minister here, to accept
                                without reservations the conciliation formula. It is not disposed at
                                this moment to make any commitments to support Bolivia’s claim to a
                                port on the Paraguay River. Freitas-Valle this morning conveyed the
                                request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as communicated by you,
                                and was told in reply that it seemed appropriate that Bolivia accept
                                without reservations the seven points of the conciliation formula
                                before discussing with her the attitude which this Government would
                                adopt during the course of the conciliation negotiations; that
                                Paraguay might rightly infer that the mediating nations were
                                adopting an attitude partial to Bolivia if they gave secret
                                commitments to Bolivia to support her claims during those
                                negotiations, whereas if the Bolivian claims appear to be fair and
                                reasonable to Argentina, Brazil, and the United States, they might
                                logically support such claims after conciliation conversations had
                                commenced without having made any prior commitment to do so.
                                Freitas-Valle appeared to be entirely in accord with this
                                policy.</p>
                            <p>From a conversation today with the Bolivian Minister here, it would
                                seem to be evident that misunderstanding has arisen in Buenos Aires
                                with regard to the statements of the Bolivian Minister in Argentina
                                made at the conference of August 16th. Please cable the views of the
                                Brazilian Government with regard to the suggestion contained in the
                                last paragraph of the Department’s 108, August 18, 1 p.m.</p>

                            <p>132. By appointment I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the
                                Brazilian Ambassador at the latter’s residence yesterday afternoon.
                                The Bolivian Minister was present.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that following a visit just
                                received from the Paraguayan Minister he felt at liberty to inform
                                the Bolivian Minister of Paraguay’s unconditional acceptance of the
                                Argentine Peace Formula.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister while registering no surprise stated he
                                considered the news important and would inform his Government. Asked
                                if he thought his Government would also accept the formula
                                unconditionally he replied negatively declaring that the phrase
                                “without reservations” in the Paraguayan letter of acceptance then
                                shown to him was not clear. After sustaining this viewpoint for some
                                time he shifted the discussion to clause VII of the formula
                                declaring this to be “vague and uncertain” arguing at length that it
                                was necessary before proceeding further to fix with Paraguay exactly
                                what was to be submitted to arbitration.</p>
                            <p>After the departure of the Bolivian Minister the Brazilian Ambassador
                                showed us a telegram from his Government stating that its Minister
                                in La Paz was being instructed to push Bolivia for an unconditional
                                acceptance of the formula.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs declared if these attempts to
                                achieve peace failed he was inclining to the belief that the
                                representatives of Argentina, Brazil and the United States should
                                draft and make public a document setting forth the negotiations
                                which would pillory Bolivia in world public opinion. I made no
                                reply.</p>
                            <p>Since drafting the foregoing I have received the Department’s 91,
                                August 20, 7 p.m., which I am carefully studying.</p>

                                reasonable but as he was convinced it was the only way of keeping
                                Bolivia from backing out. He quite understands and agrees with
                                position taken by us that we should make no commitments of any
                                character.</p>

                            <p>112. Your 181, August 21, 4 p.m. Please express to the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs the deep appreciation of this Government for the
                                message sent in your cable under reference. A similar message has
                                been received from Freitas-Valle. Please say once more how
                                invaluable we find the helpful and friendly cooperation of the
                                Brazilian Government throughout the course of these
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>The Department is now awaiting a clear and definitive statement which
                                the Bolivian Minister in Washington has requested of his Government
                                regarding the position of Bolivia with reference to arbitration. The
                                Minister’s statements in this regard have been highly satisfactory,
                                but he desires to obtain specific confirmation from his own Foreign
                                Office.</p>
                            <p>With the formal and written acceptance by Paraguay of the seven bases
                                of the conciliation formula, the desirable procedure now would seem
                                to be to obtain from Bolivia acceptance without reservation of these
                                same bases and, subsequently, to obtain from Paraguay an agreement
                                with Bolivia as to the nature of the submission to arbitration
                                should conciliation prove impracticable.</p>
                            <p>You will be advised immediately of the response received from the
                                Bolivian Minister in Washington.</p>

                            <p>137. By appointment I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the
                                Brazilian Ambassador at the latter’s [residence?] this afternoon.
                                The Minister of Foreign Affairs read a telegram from Washington
                                which seemed to follow closely paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the
                                Department’s <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0251"/>91, August 20,
                                7 p.m. I told the Minister that the information contained therein
                                appeared to coincide with that given me. The Brazilian Ambassador
                                seemed to have been similarly advised. The Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs then read a paper which he had drafted interpreting the
                                acceptance of paragraph 7 of his conciliation formula as
                                constituting also a complete acceptance of the statutes of the Hague
                                Tribunal, article 36 of which leaves to that body the determining of
                                the scope of arbitrations, et cetera, submitting [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >submitted?</hi>] to it.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs then stated that he felt it would be
                                now appropriate for the United States and Brazil to endeavor to
                                obtain at La Paz an agreement without reservation as to the
                                conciliation formula, and a clear and definite statement of
                                Bolivia’s position with respect to conciliation and with respect to
                                arbitration, the Argentine Government to undertake the same service
                                at Asunción, adding that the Brazilian Ambassador, he and I should
                                rather confine ourselves at the moment to seeing that there was no
                                breakdown in the negotiations here. I said I would inform my
                                Government of the foregoing and the Brazilian Ambassador said he
                                would do likewise.</p>
                            <p>The above suggestion from the Minister for Foreign Affairs seems to
                                take care of the concluding paragraph of the Department’s telegram
                                referred to above, save that it limits the suggestion to action at
                                the two belligerent capitals.</p>
                            <p>Following this the Paraguayan Minister arrived and the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs read to him the paper relating to his interpretation
                                of paragraph 7 of his conciliation formula above referred to, with
                                which the Paraguayan representative said he was in accord, adding
                                that his Government had accepted the formula with a full
                                consciousness of its implications and in a spirit of entire good
                                faith.</p>

                            <p>17. There appears to have arisen considerable misunderstanding in the
                                course of the conversations held in Buenos Aires between Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas and the Bolivian Minister in Argentina as to the
                                statements made by the Bolivian Minister in Washington with regard
                                to the views of his government concerning the conciliation formula.
                                Dr. Finot’s statements to this Government have been entirely clear
                                and have been clearly comprehended. He has today confirmed the
                                Department’s prior understanding on this point. Inasmuch as the
                                first message received from the Bolivian Government with regard to
                                its attitude towards adoption of the conciliation formula appeared
                                to leave room for doubt, Dr. Finot, at the Department’s request,
                                cabled <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0252"/>for a further
                                expression of Bolivia’s views, which he interpreted to the
                                Department as follows: that the statement referring to the <hi
                                    rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of the outlet to the River
                                Paraguay was intended for the confidential information of the
                                mediating nations in order that Argentina might sound out the
                                position of Paraguay with regard thereto and was to be construed as
                                a clear warning on the part of Bolivia that Bolivia could not accept
                                an agreement through conciliation unless an outlet to the River
                                Paraguay formed a part of such agreement. He stated further that the
                                    <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> was understood to refer
                                solely to efforts at conciliation and not to an agreement to
                                arbitrate. Please advise the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                immediately of the above and state that there is no misunderstanding
                                on the part of this Government of the views expressed by Dr. Finot
                                as above outlined.</p>
                            <p>As the Bolivian Government has been informed, the Government of
                                Paraguay has now accepted formally and in writing and without
                                reservation the seven bases contained in the conciliation formula
                                proposed by Dr. Saavedra Lamas. This Government earnestly hopes that
                                the Government of Bolivia may be disposed to take similar action
                                promptly. While the Government of the United States is unwilling to
                                make any prior commitment to support the claims of either one of the
                                belligerent nations, you may say that in the conciliation
                                conversations which might ensue, this Government, as one of the
                                mediating powers, would necessarily support any proposals for
                                solution which at such time appeared to it to be fair and
                                reasonable.</p>
                            <p>It seems highly important that the Government of Bolivia define
                                clearly its attitude towards arbitration and it would seem desirable
                                that the bases for arbitration be agreed upon prior to the
                                commencement of conciliation conversations in order that both
                                nations may realize that if the attempt at conciliation fails,
                                arbitration by the Permanent Court becomes at once obligatory at the
                                end of the time stipulated in the conciliation formula.</p>
                            <p>Please cable the Department fully the response which may be made to
                                you by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and express the pleasure
                                with which this Government will receive any suggestions which the
                                Bolivian Government may care to make as to how it may be helpful in
                                bringing about an agreement along the lines proposed in the
                                Argentine conciliation formula. The Department understands that your
                                Brazilian colleague has been instructed to cooperate closely with
                                you and that similar instructions have been sent to him by his
                                Government.</p>

                            <p>138. At reception given this afternoon by the President to American
                                newspaper men the Minister of Foreign Affairs told me that he today
                                received a visit from the Bolivian Minister who seemed to be in a
                                responsive mood with regard to the Chaco and would meet the Minister
                                of Foreign Affairs, the Brazilian Ambassador and me tomorrow
                                afternoon for further discussion.</p>
                            <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs then stated in the presence of the
                                President that he considered the moment critical and that what was
                                now required was strong and immediate pressure on Bolivia. The
                                President concurred in these statements although minimizing the
                                importance which the Minister of Foreign Affairs gave to reported
                                Paraguayan victories. The President added that he hoped the efforts
                                his Government was now making to promote peace would convince my
                                Government of the sincerity of the desire of Argentina to bring
                                hostilities to an end. I assured him there was no doubt in my mind
                                of this attitude.</p>

                            <p>189. 1. Minister for Foreign Affairs has instructed Brazilian
                                Minister at La Paz to endeavor to persuade Bolivian Government to
                                accept unconditionally the seven points already accepted by Paraguay
                                and to add that indefinite procrastination on the part of Bolivia
                                will inevitably jeopardize the efforts now being made to bring about
                                a peaceful solution.</p>

                                Minister. Brazilian Government shares in the view that the attitude
                                of the Bolivian Government constitutes the immediate problem and
                                that our effort should be concentrated for the moment on eliciting a
                                clear-cut statement of its position.</p>

                            <p>114. Your 189, August 25, 2 p.m. The American Minister in La Paz was
                                instructed last week to make the same representations to Bolivia as

                                reference. The American Minister in Bolivia will be in constant

                            <p>139. By invitation I met the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
                                Brazilian Ambassador at the latter’s residence Saturday afternoon.
                                The Bolivian Minister was present.</p>
                            <p>After extensive discussion the Minister of Foreign Affairs outlined
                                his interpretation of the attitude concerning conciliation of the
                                Bolivian Government as set forth by the Bolivian Minister, and
                                stated the attitude of the Argentine Government toward this,
                                agreeing to reduce his declaration to writing and to furnish a copy
                                to all present.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister concurred in the Minister of Foreign Affairs’
                                interpretation, saying he would make this known to La Paz
                                immediately on receipt of the draft from the Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs. My copy of the draft which I received last night appears to
                                be in exact harmony with the original declaration. A close
                                translation reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Bolivia insisting that its point of view <hi rend="italic"
                                            >sine qua non</hi> to reach a conciliation solution is
                                        that it be given (within such a solution) an outlet to the
                                        River Paraguay below Bahía Negra and expressing its wish to
                                        be informed—confidentially—of the support which in this
                                        respect it might obtain from the three mediating powers,
                                        Argentina declares that in its desire to reach a
                                        conciliation, it will support that point of view, provided
                                        that it may be brought into harmony with the point of view
                                        of Paraguay, adding that should such a suggestion not be
                                        accepted by Paraguay, it (Argentina) will propose other and
                                        different suggestions with a view to obtaining the
                                        desideratum of peace.</p>
                                    <p>It must be clearly understood that the contribution requested
                                        by Bolivia for the solution of the difficulty does not
                                        constitute ratification or approval of the Bolivian point of
                                        view and that the Argentine Government does not prejudice
                                        the basic question, which will have to be decided by
                                        arbitration at the opportune time, that is when the efforts
                                        to obtain harmony may have failed, making it necessary to
                                        apply article VII of the plan which prescribes
                                        arbitration”.</p>

                            <p>During our discussion the Minister of Foreign Affairs seemed at first
                                to desire that the Brazilian Ambassador and I should make
                                declarations concerning our consent of Governments’ attitude similar
                                to his own but I said I was not authorized to do this and the
                                Brazilian Ambassador said the same.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister is suspected by the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs of trying to place the latter’s Government and that of
                                Brazil and the United States in the position of not only supporting
                                but of endorsing Bolivia’s viewpoint with regard to an outlet on the
                                Paraguay <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0256"/>River; and the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs seeks to avoid such a commitment
                                through the declaration quoted above.</p>
                            <p>The Brazilian Ambassador tells me he has been instructed to work in
                                close harmony with me in all negotiations. He and I are at one in
                                thinking that just now any pressure by our two Governments on
                                Bolivia should be at La Paz.</p>

                            <p>39. Following is a summary of my despatch 105 which was sent air mail
                                August 23.<note n="23" xml:id="d238fn23">Not printed.</note> Buenos
                                Aires has a copy and the Ambassador suggested that I cable this
                                summary.</p>
                            <p>On his own initiative I saw the President at his house August 17th.
                                He made clear for the first time that instead of the reluctant
                                yielding of a port on the Paraguay River he was quite anxious to
                                make arrangements for a Bolivian port. He observed that Bolivia owns
                                many millions of acres of oil lands which are not involved in the
                                Chaco dispute. Pipe lines to a river port would be of advantage to
                                Paraguay, calling for the building of refineries, increasing
                                population and assuring cheaper gasoline for Paraguay. He explained
                                that Argentina was not [<hi rend="italic">now?</hi>] interested in
                                some arrangements to pipe the oil from the Bolivian fields south to
                                connect with Argentine oil fields and refineries. It would be, he
                                said, more advantageous for Bolivia to connect with a Paraguayan
                                port than to throw this traffic to Argentina. The piping would be
                                easier, and the product could be exported more economically.</p>
                            <p>I got from all this that President Ayala does not view Argentina’s
                                interest in promoting peace as unselfish and as purely a gesture of
                                good neighborliness; that Argentine participation in mediation or
                                arbitration could scarcely be disassociated from her desire to link
                                her territory effectively to Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>The President did not seem disturbed about the Chilean incident and
                                expressed satisfaction at the departure of the Chilean Minister.
                                Comment from other reliable sources is to the effect that much of
                                the difficulty in reestablishing cordial relations between Paraguay
                                and Chile is due to bad feeling between the Foreign Ministers of
                                Argentina and Chile.</p>

                            <p>101. In the course of a conversation at the Department yesterday, the
                                Bolivian Minister stated that his Government was as yet hesitant as
                                to acceptance of the conciliation formula without reservations
                                because of its belief that Article 7 was so vaguely worded as not to
                                impose the obligation on the part of Paraguay to submit the dispute
                                to the arbitration of the Permanent Court in the event that
                                conciliation endeavors prove unsuccessful, and furthermore, because
                                the said article made no provision for determining the scope of
                                arbitration. The Minister was asked whether in his opinion, were
                                Paraguay formally to ratify the interpretation given Article 7 by
                                Dr. Saavedra Lamas,<note n="24" xml:id="d239fn24">See telegram No.

                                provided would be sufficient to allay the fears of his Government.
                                Dr. Finot expressed the belief that ratification of this
                                interpretation by Paraguay would be satisfactory to Bolivia and he
                                was requested specifically to confirm his personal understanding of
                                his Government’s view which he promised immediately to do by
                                cable.</p>
                            <p>In discussing the question of conciliation, the Minister asked
                                whether Argentina refused to sound out the viewpoint of Paraguay
                                with regard to the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> specified by
                                Bolivia. The Minister was informed that in the opinion of the
                                Department Paraguay would feel herself unwilling to make any formal
                                commitment on this point prior to the conciliation conversations,
                                but that this Government saw no reason why the matter might not be
                                brought confidentially to the attention of Paraguay, and the
                                Bolivian Government thereafter be confidentially advised whether
                                this point would prove an insuperable objection in the conciliation
                                negotiations. For your strictly confidential information, the
                                Department’s statement on this latter point was made in view of the
                                conversation between the American Minister at Asunción and President
                                Ayala held on August 17 of which you have been advised by the
                                former.</p>
                            <p>Please discuss the substance of the above with Dr. Saavedra Lamas at
                                the earliest opportunity and advise him that it is the impression of
                                this Government that Bolivia will accept the conciliation formula
                                without reservation, provided Article 7 of the formula is
                                interpreted by Paraguay in the manner set forth by Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas, and provided Bolivia is given confidentially to understand
                                that the sounding out by Argentina of Paraguay on the question of
                                the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> has not been productive of
                                completely unsatisfactory results.</p>
                            <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0258"/>
                            <p>The decision of the Bolivian Government will be reached only after
                                President Salamanca returns to La Paz and the intended reply of
                                Bolivia will be first made known to Brazil and to the United States
                                before formal transmission to the Argentine Foreign Office.
                                Favorable and early action on the two points above mentioned may, it
                                is hoped, bring forth an equally favorable decision on the part of
                                Bolivia.</p>

                            <p>142. Referring to my telegram No. 139, August 27, 4 p.m., Brazilian
                                Ambassador today told me that he is informed by his Government that
                                it is in accord with Bolivia’s desire to obtain an outlet to the
                                Paraguay River below Bahía Negra and that it will uphold this
                                viewpoint within the committee of conciliation provided for in the
                                Argentine peace formula.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon told me that
                                yesterday he had communicated the Bolivian confidential <hi

                            <p>149. Department’s 101, August 29, 3 p.m. I this afternoon
                                communicated the essential contents of Department’s message to the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>He stated that he had just discussed at length the Chaco matter with
                                President Justo who said that there were questions of national
                                dignity now becoming involved and that it behooved his Government to
                                act with extreme circumspection. The Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                continued that he could not take up alone with Paraguay the matter
                                of obtaining its formal ratification of his interpretation of clause
                                7 of his formula. It would seem that he had already discussed this
                                with the Paraguayan Minister since the latter had informed him that
                                his <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0259"/>formal acceptance of
                                the interpretation in the presence of the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs and the two Ambassadors should be an evidence of his
                                Government’s good faith, the Paraguayan Minister further remarking
                                that although Paraguay had made a written statement of its position
                                nothing whatever had been received from Bolivia.…</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs continued that advices just received
                                from Rio de Janeiro indicated that the Brazilian Government was
                                getting tired of the whole subject in the face of the fruitlessness
                                of efforts thus far made. He declared that the Bolivian attitude and
                                policy seemed to be to delay any effective action and that “Bolivia
                                must first give some sort of answer before Paraguay is pushed
                                further” adding that thus far every suggestion made by Bolivia has
                                been met without arriving anywhere.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that if in the
                                negotiations the Bolivian Government sought to place the Argentine
                                Government in a secondary position it would immediately withdraw
                                from the affair; he said further that if nothing should be
                                accomplished he considered making public a statement setting forth
                                the course and conduct of the negotiations.</p>

                            <p>151. I met the Brazilian Ambassador and the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs in the latter’s office this morning. The Bolivian Minister
                                who was also present said that he hoped for a reply today from his
                                Government <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0260"/>to an urgent
                                message he had sent last night asking for Bolivia’s decision on the
                                peace formula. He urged the necessity for securing Paraguay’s formal
                                acceptance of the interpretation of the formula drafted by the
                                Minister of Foreign Affairs. The latter referred to the solemn
                                statements made by the Paraguayan Minister (see my 137, August 23, 6
                                p.m.) and expressed disinclination to take up the matter again. The
                                Bolivian Minister said that he felt it was highly desirable to
                                clarify doubtful points before proceeding further, emphasizing the
                                desire of his Government for arbitration but stressing the
                                importance of making paragraph 7 entirely clear, while the Minister
                                urged that his Government accept the formula in principle and then
                                ask for the clarification of doubtful points.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that he had just received a
                                visit from the Spanish Ambassador who asked on behalf of his
                                Government for a copy of the peace formula and for full information
                                concerning the negotiations and that he had informed him that the

                                to meet the Bolivian Minister again tomorrow or as soon as he

                            <p>My Brazilian colleague thinks that Bolivia is pursuing dilatory
                                tactics and I am inclined to share this view.</p>

                                to that addressed by the Brazilian Government to the Bolivian
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs was today made by this Government to
                                the Bolivian Minister in Washington. The Bolivian Minister has
                                showed me a telegram from his Government informing him of its urgent
                                desire for a successful outcome of the present negotiations. He has
                                further intimated that the Bolivian Government preferred the
                                negotiations provided for in the conciliation formula with the
                                participation of Brazil and the United States to negotiations under
                                the auspices of the League. He has promised to cable his Government,
                                immediately insisting that a clear statement of Bolivia’s views with
                                regard to the conciliation formula be given Brazil and the United
                                States before September 7th. The Bolivian Minister feels <pb n="191"
                                    xml:id="pg_191" facs="0261"/>that his Government will be
                                unwilling, however, to request the postponement of the action of the
                                League under Article XV because of the general belief in Bolivia
                                that Bolivia will be in a more favorable position before the
                                Assembly than will Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>For your strictly personal information. I am inclined to believe that
                                the Bolivian Government is more favorably disposed towards the
                                present negotiations rather than a renewal of activity by the League
                                because of the fact that the Bolivian Minister here was instructed
                                some 2 weeks ago to proceed to Geneva to defend Bolivia’s cause
                                before the Assembly. Upon his protesting against the instruction on
                                the ground that he would be more useful in Washington than in
                                Geneva, he has been permitted to remain here, and the Bolivian
                                Government has apparently determined to present her cause in Geneva
                                through her present delegate. If Bolivian [Government?] were
                                determined to press the matter vigorously before the Assembly, it
                                would seem likely that she would have selected the strongest
                                delegation possible.</p>

                            <p>106. The Department received last night from the Bolivian Minister
                                the text of the Bolivian suggestions for modification to the
                                conciliation formula. The Argentine Ambassador this morning received
                                a cable from Saavedra Lamas stating that in his opinion, after
                                preliminary study, the Bolivian suggestions were “conciliable” and
                                that he had immediately transmitted the text to the Government of
                                Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of the Department, the proposals appear reasonable,
                                although Article VII as proposed by Bolivia lacks clarity and leaves
                                open to doubt the determination of the arbitral tribunal and the
                                time for the signing of the arbitral agreement. The Bolivian
                                Minister here has stated that he believes that his Government would
                                accept the Permanent Court of International Justice and would be
                                quite willing that the arbitral agreement should be signed within
                                the period fixed for conciliation. Consequently, it would seem
                                highly desirable that Article VII as proposed by Bolivia should be
                                amended to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Bolivia and Paraguay declare that in the event that the
                                        conciliation is not successful, they will sign an agreement
                                        within the same period of 70 days mentioned above in Article
                                        VI, submitting to the juridical arbitration of the Permanent
                                        Court of International Justice the determination of the

                            <p>Please state to Dr. Saavedra Lamas at the earliest possible
                                opportunity that this Government has learned with the greatest
                                gratification of his opinion that the Bolivian proposals appear to
                                offer a basis for settlement, which opinion this Government fully
                                shares. Explain to him the feeling which I hold regarding the
                                revision of Article VII as suggested by Bolivia and read to him the
                                suggested amendment thereof as above quoted. Please state that it
                                would seem highly desirable to leave no room for controversy or
                                doubt as to this exceedingly important point in his conciliation
                                formula and that should he consider it desirable, the suggestions
                                indicated would be pressed upon Bolivia by the United States and, it
                                is anticipated, by Brazil as well, with the hope that this further
                                revision may make it easier to obtain the agreement by Paraguay to
                                the original amendments suggested by Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>You should further state that this Government has received this
                                evening a cable from Geneva<note n="29" xml:id="d245fn29">See
                                    telegram No. 224, September 7, 4 p.m., from the Consul at
                                    Geneva, <ref target="#pg_79">p. 79</ref>.</note> reporting that
                                Najera, the Chairman of the Council Committee, has stated that
                                should Argentina furnish an official statement which could be made
                                public to the effect that a satisfactory settlement at Buenos Aires
                                was imminent, the Assembly would not take up the question for at
                                least 1 or 2 weeks; that should an immediate statement or later
                                statements indicate that the peace plans were progressing favorably
                                or that a settlement was not probable until after the Assembly
                                session on the call for the Assembly of an expose of the peace
                                project which the Assembly found satisfactory, the Assembly would
                                probably be willing to withhold independent action pending the
                                result of such efforts. The Department understands that this
                                information has been cabled by the Argentine Delegate to Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas. This Government shares the belief expressed by Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas through the Argentine Ambassador here that it would
                                be deeply regrettable if the exceedingly favorable prospects for
                                peace resulting from his initiative were now jeopardized by a
                                conflict of jurisdiction and that it is hoped that he may find it
                                possible to give the statement requested by the Chairman of the
                                Council Committee. This Government has reason to believe that
                                Bolivia will <pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0263"/>be willing to
                                withdraw her petition for action under Article XV as soon as a
                                definite agreement with Paraguay on the basis of the Argentine
                                conciliation formula has been reached.</p>
                            <p>Please cable fully Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ views on the above points at
                                the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

                                    <p>Article VII to read as follows: ‘Bolivia and Paraguay declare

                                        declaration of August 3, 1932, taking as a basis the maximum
                                        claims already advanced by the two parties, namely: by
                                        Bolivia, in the memorandum of February 28, 1933, to the
                                        Governments of the neighboring countries; and by Paraguay,
                                        in the note of her Delegate to the League of Nations dated
                                        June 6, 1933.’”</p></quote></p>
                            <p>Saavedra Lamas has cabled the Argentine Ambassador here that he
                                considers the Bolivian proposals as providing a basis for acceptance
                                and that he has transmitted the Bolivian reply to Paraguay.</p>
                            <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0264"/>
                            <p>In the Department’s opinion, the Bolivian proposals appear to be
                                reasonable, although the form of Article VII seems to lack clarity
                                and to leave open to question both the arbitral tribunal to which
                                the parties shall go, as well as the time within which the
                                arbitration agreement would be signed and would become effective in
                                the event that conciliation does not prosper. The Bolivian Minister
                                has stated, however, that in his opinion, his Government would be
                                willing to sign the proposed arbitration agreement within the period
                                provided for conciliation and further that while it would prefer
                                American arbitration, it would be willing to accept the arbitration
                                of the Permanent Court. It would seem highly desirable that Article
                                VII which is the fundamental point of the proposed agreement should
                                be worded in such a manner as to leave no room for controversy or
                                doubt. Please inquire, therefore, of the Brazilian Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs whether should the Government of Brazil share our
                                views it would be willing to suggest to Bolivia that Article VII as
                                now proposed by Bolivia be amended to read as follows: <quote

                            <p>If the Brazilian Government coincides in the desirability of this

                                of such change with the understanding that the two Governments
                                support such modification and endeavor with the assistance of
                                Argentina to obtain the consent of Paraguay thereto.</p>
                            <p>The above suggestion is being cabled to Saavedra Lamas in order that
                                he may express his views with regard thereto. I think it would be
                                advisable that neither Brazil nor the United States approach Bolivia
                                in the matter until we assure ourselves that Saavedra Lamas is
                                likewise in accord.</p>

                                the same as those expressed by Brazil. A cable has been received
                                this evening from Geneva stating that Najera, Chairman of the
                                Council Committee, states that should Argentina furnish the <pb

                                statement which could be made public to the effect that a
                                satisfactory settlement at Buenos Aires was imminent, the Assembly
                                would not take up the question for at least 1 or 2 weeks. The
                                Department is further advised that this information has been cabled
                                to Saavedra Lamas by the Argentine Delegate in Geneva. The policy of
                                Avenol seems to be that if the League can justify delay by means of
                                a public statement that success in the present negotiations is
                                imminent, he will be willing to have any immediate action by the
                                Council Committee or by the Assembly held off. It is further assumed
                                that should an agreement on the conciliation formula be reached,
                                Bolivia would be willing to withdraw her petition for action by the
                                Assembly under Article XV.</p>

                            <p>154. I communicated the contents of the Department’s telegram No.
                                106, September 7, 9 p.m., to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                yesterday morning who expressed his strong conviction that the
                                Bolivian suggestions modifying his formula offered a favorable basis
                                for solution and added that he also believed Bolivia would be
                                willing to accept the Permanent Court of International Jurists in an
                                arbitration.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated further that the Department’s
                                proposed amendment to article 7 insofar as it provides for a period
                                of 60 [<hi rend="italic">70?</hi>] days within which arbitral
                                agreement might be signed is unacceptable as it affects an essential
                                feature of his formula which contemplates a simultaneous signing of
                                the agreement for arbitration and conciliation (the Brazilian
                                Ambassador told me this is also the viewpoint of his Government).
                                The concluding portion of the suggested amendment the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs said might be favorably studied.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Saavedra Lamas said further that he felt the subject was now one
                                for decision by the Presidents of the belligerent countries and that
                                he was considering sending his legal adviser to Asunción to lay the
                                situation before the President since he feels that neither of the
                                two Ministers here is advancing the cause of peace.</p>
                            <p>Yesterday afternoon I met the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the
                                Bolivian Minister and the Brazilian Ambassador at the latter’s
                                residence when we discussed the Bolivian suggestion at length. An
                                acceptance more in line with the original peace formula was urged
                                upon the Bolivian Minister who said he would lay the matter before
                                his Government.</p>
                            <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0266"/>
                            <p>We also discussed the situation vis-à-vis the League of Nations, the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs feeling that the most he should do
                                would be to telegraph to Geneva the bare fact of Paraguay’s
                                unconditional acceptance of his formula, and that Bolivia had
                                accepted in principle, making no plea or recommendation. However,
                                the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to withhold sending this message
                                until the Bolivian Minister had communicated with his Government
                                which he promised to do.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the conversation the Bolivian Minister said “My
                                country does not refuse the Hague Tribunal; it leaves the matter
                                open”. He stated further that his Government would welcome comments
                                and counsel in the matter of the Bolivian suggestion for

                            <p>107. Your 154, September 9, 10 a.m. Please cable Department
                                immediately what prior statements Dr. Saavedra Lamas may have made
                                to you providing for a simultaneous signing of the agreement for
                                arbitration and conciliation under the terms of the conciliation
                                formula. If the interpretation Dr. Saavedra gives to the
                                conciliation formula is that the signing of the conciliation formula
                                will be simultaneous with the conclusion by Bolivia and Paraguay of
                                an agreement to arbitrate, the solution would appear to be
                                satisfactory in every way. The Department has not, however, received
                                any previous intimation that this was the intent and neither Article
                                VII of the original conciliation formula nor Article VII in the
                                Bolivian counter proposal make this point clear.</p>
                            <p>If Dr. Saavedra Lamas interprets his intention along the lines above
                                indicated, you may state that the procedure so outlined would appear
                                entirely satisfactory to this Government and that the suggestion for
                                modification of Article VII previously communicated to you by the
                                Department should consequently be modified accordingly.</p>
                            <p>It was the Department’s understanding, as it was that of the
                                Brazilian Government, that the Bolivian modifications were to be
                                communicated confidentially to the mediating powers in order that
                                Brazil and the United States might be afforded the opportunity of
                                suggesting to Bolivia such changes in her proposal as might seem
                                desirable and calculated to afford a better opportunity of obtaining
                                Paraguayan acquiescence. The Brazilian Government has expressed to
                                us its surprise <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0267"/>that Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas has forwarded the Bolivian conditions to Paraguay
                                without consulting either Brazil or the United States. It would be
                                advisable for you at some appropriate opportunity to make it clear
                                to Dr. Saavedra Lamas that both this Government and Brazil might be
                                enabled more effectively to assist in the negotiations if, when the
                                Paraguayan reply to the Bolivian suggestions is received, Brazil and
                                the United States be afforded the opportunity of being advised of
                                such reply before it is communicated to Bolivia. In that way both
                                Brazil and the United States would be enabled to consult with the
                                Argentine Government as to the representations which should be made
                                to Bolivia.</p>

                            <p>156. Department’s telegram No. 107, September 10, 7 p.m. The Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs informed me orally yesterday afternoon that his
                                interpretation of the concessions [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >conciliation</hi>] formula is that the signing thereof would be
                                simultaneous with the conclusion by Bolivia and Paraguay of an
                                agreement to arbitrate. I therefore, communicated to the Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs the contents of the second paragraph of the
                                Department’s telegram above referred to regarding which, however, he
                                made no comment. He also told me that he has but little hope of
                                anything being accomplished through conciliation proceedings and
                                feels that the two countries must be caught in an inescapable
                                arbitration agreement if peace is to be achieved.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister who with the Brazilian Ambassador was present a
                                part of the time refused to agree that the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs might inform the League of Nations that his Government
                                accepted the peace formula “in principle.” Dr. Saavedra Lamas said
                                that he proposed to discuss the matter with the Paraguayan Minister
                                today before telegraphing Geneva.</p>
                            <p>I am meeting the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Brazilian
                                Ambassador and the Paraguayan Minister this afternoon and shall

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: My Government has followed
                                with lively interest the noble efforts made by the other governments
                                of America to bring about a termination of the state of war existing
                                between Bolivia and Paraguay. It has also lent its friendly
                                cooperation to that end, in fulfillment of the duty of every sister
                                people to watch over the peace and tranquility of the Continent.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, all these efforts have not resulted in the desired
                                success. The specter of war continues to foment hatreds in that
                                region; decimating generations, uselessly sacrificing hundreds of
                                lives. Such are the cable reports that we receive daily as to the
                                tragic development of the fratricidal struggle.</p>
                            <p>The recent appeal made by a noted Uruguayan daily, calling upon all
                                the mothers of America to help in putting a stop to the war in
                                question should also move the men of those countries to find the
                                desired formula of peace and which would restore to those two sister
                                peoples the harmony that they need.</p>
                            <p>It is with this feeling that the Government of El Salvador ventures
                                respectfully to appeal to the conscience of America to make one more
                                effort to bring about an agreement between Bolivia and Paraguay; and
                                it feels sure that Your Excellency’s Government, which on all
                                occasions has given proof of its love of peace on the continent,
                                will see fit to give its consideration and its valuable support to
                                the idea, which I have the honor to set forth hereinafter, the
                                purpose of which is to put an end to the bloody tragedy.</p>
                            <p>An honorable antecedent of this attitude is the continental
                                declaration of August 3, 1932, which filled our America with hope
                                and brought into prominence the example of the union of all the
                                American peoples in the face of the catastrophe of the two sister
                                peoples engaged in the struggle. Subsequently, in confirmation of
                                this fraternal principle, were the efforts made by the VII
                                Panamerican Conference, which, on December 24, 1933, “reaffirms its
                                unalterable faith in pacific measures for the settlement of
                                international conflicts” and “reiterates the disposition of the
                                countries represented thereat to support, in accordance with the
                                special circumstances and policy of each Government, the formula of
                                settlement which may be arrived at for the solution of the Chaco
                                conflict [“].<note n="33" xml:id="d250fn33"><hi rend="italic">Report

                                of all America, to the Governments of Paraguay and Bolivia, on the
                                bases that they may consider advisable, the acceptance of an
                                armistice to last for a year at least or the time that they may
                                consider sufficient for those countries to study a just and friendly
                                solution of their differences, thus following the edifying example
                                of patriotism that has been bequeathed to the history of America by
                                four sister Republics, Guatemala and Honduras, Colombia and Peru, in

                                Department’s 107, September 10, 7 p.m. I met the Brazilian
                                Ambassador, the Paraguayan Minister and the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs at the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon. The Paraguayan
                                Minister stated “in the name of his Government” that since Bolivia
                                had suggested modifications to the original Argentine peace formula
                                which formula his government had accepted without reservations
                                Paraguay asks permission if Bolivia persists in this attitude to
                                withdraw its unqualified acceptance and to submit observations and
                                suggestions of its own. This was the first intimation I had received
                                of Paraguay’s attitude vis-à-vis the Bolivian suggestions.</p>
                            <p>After the departure of the Paraguayan Minister the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs discussed at length with my Brazilian colleague and
                                me the language of a message which he said he was about to send to
                                the League authorities concerning the status of the negotiations
                                with Bolivia and Paraguay. He repeated his previous declarations
                                that <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0270"/>this message should be
                                a bald statement of fact (see my telegram 154, September 9, 10 a.m.)
                                in order to guard his impartial position between the two
                                belligerents and that nothing should be communicated which would
                                damage either country before the League although he said Argentina’s
                                position before that body is “very delicate”. He said that this
                                would leave to the League to determine whether “the good offices” of
                                the mediating countries should now come to an end and in that case
                                the League to accept the responsibility for success or failure in
                                further negotiations.</p>
                            <p>Following this I made known the contents of the Department’s 108
                                September 11, 7 p.m. to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said
                                the information appearing in the first paragraph of the Consul’s
                                telegram was substantially correct but that there appeared to be a
                                “misunderstanding” as to Cantilo’s other statements and that he
                                proposed sending a message to Geneva which would clear up the
                                matter.</p>

                            <p>35. The Department is advised that the Bolivian reply was transmitted
                                by Dr. Saavedra Lamas to the Paraguayan Government some days ago. As
                                yet this Government has received no information as to the attitude
                                of the Paraguayan Government with regard thereto. At the present
                                moment it is not considered desirable for you to make any specific
                                inquiry of the President or Minister for Foreign Affairs in order to
                                ascertain the views which they may hold. Please cable, however, any
                                information which may have come to you concerning the probable
                                reaction of the Paraguayan Government to the Bolivian
                                suggestions.</p>

                                Buenos Aires dated September 11, 8 p.m. but so garbled that it had

                                    that he thought of making a brief statement to the League on the

                                    proposal without reservation on the part of Paraguay and the
                                    modifications proposed by Bolivia, adding that although it was
                                    his idea to join with Bolivia in requesting the League to
                                    postpone action that Bolivia had declined to take such a

                                    satisfactory results have as yet been obtained. He said that

                            <p>42. Department’s No. 35, September 13, 3 p.m. At the President’s
                                invitation and before receiving the Department’s telegram I called
                                at his house the eve of September 12 and talked with him for more
                                than 1 hour. He seems to feel that nothing will come of the present
                                peace negotiations and I assumed that the Paraguayan reply to the
                                Bolivian counter proposals had been sent.… The President stated
                                emphatically that the Bolivian demand for a port on the river is not
                                a proper subject for arbitration but for discussion and negotiation
                                after the fighting has ended and the armies have been demobilized.
                                He objected strongly to the Bolivian insistence upon Paraguay’s
                                recognition in advance of the juridical claims affecting territorial
                                rights. He reiterated his anxious desire for peace with guarantees
                                against the renewal of the war. He stated his confidence in the
                                loyalty of the Paraguayan people and army. For the first time the
                                President expressed the opinion that neither side could obtain a
                                decisive victory in the field.</p>
                            <p>The President told me of a new plan in which he is much interested.
                                He spoke in strictest confidence and I respectfully request that my
                                relations with the President be protected in whatever use the
                                Department may see fit to make of this information.</p>
                            <p>The President had just finished a letter to the Paraguayan Minister
                                in the Argentine Republic containing the suggestion that if possible
                                the Presidents of Argentina, Brazil and the United States should
                                join in a peremptory demand upon the two belligerents to stop the
                                war, exude [<hi rend="italic">withdraw?</hi>] their armies and
                                appoint representatives to meet in order to discuss arbitration. I
                                inferred that the President expects the Paraguayan Minister in
                                Buenos Aires to sound the President of Argentina directly on this
                                matter. The President expressed his admiration of the character and
                                ability of the President of Argentina. He asked me whether I thought
                                that President Roosevelt would join <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203"
                                    facs="0273"/>in such a movement. I replied that I was not in a
                                position to express an opinion but that I felt sure that my
                                Government probably would continue in its policy of having South
                                American Republics take the initiative in peace efforts. The
                                President then requested that I keep this matter strictly
                                confidential until he had heard from Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>I realize that if such a movement succeeds it would place Paraguay in
                                a strong position since President Ayala is not prepared to accede to
                                such a demand. Bolivia naturally would refuse if it suspected that
                                the idea was Paraguayan in origin. However, I am convinced of the
                                President’s genuine and pressing desire to end the war, even though
                                it is complicated by his desire to avoid Argentine domination and
                                his refusal to cede territory in advance of the discussion and
                                negotiation. My despatch No. 115 leaving Asunción September 16
                                contains further details.<note n="38" xml:id="d254fn38">Not

                                Please inform Dr. Saavedra Lamas at the earliest opportunity of the
                                interest with which this Government has received his views as
                                transmitted in your two cables under reference. You may further say
                                that this Government would appreciate having at the first
                                opportunity the “observations and suggestions” which Paraguay
                                intends to make if its unqualified acceptance of the conciliation
                                formula is withdrawn, should these have been transmitted to the
                                Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs. It would seem to be highly
                                useful to obtain at the earliest possible opportunity the considered
                                views of the Paraguayan Government with regard to the Bolivian
                                suggestions in order to ascertain whether there is not a common
                                ground and whether the apparent difference between the points of
                                view of the two countries expressed in your 158 is not susceptible
                                to solution. From the views expressed here by the Bolivian Minister,
                                the Department believes that there is ample ground for hope of a
                                satisfactory adjustment of the views of Bolivia concerning
                                arbitration to those expressed by Paraguay.</p>
                            <p>I am somewhat concerned by the statement made by Dr. Saavedra Lamas
                                and reported in your 157 in which he said that his proposed
                                declaration to the League would leave it to the League “to determine
                                whether the good offices of the mediating countries should now come
                                to <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0274"/>an end”. I assume that
                                the statement thus quoted was made orally to you and will not be
                                incorporated in any official declaration made by the Argentine
                                Delegate at the League. The only inference which can be drawn from
                                this statement is that the United States will be willing to permit
                                the League to decide whether or not it should continue its mediation
                                between two belligerent republics of the American continent when its
                                good offices have been accepted by both parties. The determination
                                to be reached by the Government of the United States in such regard
                                is, of course, a matter which can be decided only by itself and you
                                are desired, tactfully but clearly, to emphasize this point in your
                                conversation with Dr. Saavedra Lamas. The position of Argentina with
                                regard to the League is completely distinct from that of the United
                                States and this Government reserves complete liberty of action with
                                regard to what its policy may be in connection with the continuation
                                of the present peace negotiations. The attitude of the Government of
                                Brazil is identical with that of this Government.</p>

                            <p>125. Your 218, September 13, 6 p.m., paragraph 7. I hope that the
                                intimation that Brazil is considering possible withdrawal from
                                mediation given you by the Minister of Foreign Affairs is not to be
                                construed as any considered opinion but as merely due to momentary
                                irritation. The difficulties of the negotiation are patent and have
                                been recognized from the outset. In any event, please make sure that
                                no decision is reached by the Brazilian Government in this regard
                                without our being afforded a full opportunity of discussing the pros
                                and cons of the situation.</p>

                                Paraguay desires to withdraw her original acceptance in order to
                                propose modifications in her turn.</p>
                            <p>2. Ambassador reports Lamas has confirmed the substance of his note
                                to the Bolivian Government in regard to the forts, stating that
                                Argentine forces have occupied only three forts and this because by
                                a change in the course of the Pilcomayo River they are now in
                                Argentine territory, and further that Bolivian detachments which
                                occupied them requested the Argentine forces to take them over.</p>
                            <p>3. Bolivian Minister for Foreign Affairs expresses surprise to
                                Brazilian Minister at Lamas’ action in informing the League that his
                                mediation is ended and that the solution is now in the hands of the
                                League. He requests the Brazilian Government to ask explanation of
                                “this strange behavior”.</p>
                            <p>4. Foreign Office has explained to the Bolivian Minister here that in
                                its opinion the Bolivian Government is not entitled to regard this
                                behaviour as strange; that the mediating powers urged Bolivia to
                                request postponement of action by the League and that in spite of
                                original agreement Bolivia had done nothing and it was therefore
                                felt that Bolivia had no ground for complaint.</p>
                            <p>5. Bolivian Minister called at Foreign Office today with further
                                appeal that Brazil and the United States should join the League
                                Committee at Geneva, and was told in definite terms that under no
                                circumstances could Brazil consider such action. His attention was
                                called to previous official statements to the same effect.</p>
                            <p>6. No answer has as yet been received to Brazil’s request for
                                explanation of Cantilo’s speech and Lamas’ position. The Foreign
                                Minister feels that if Lamas has indeed turned the matter over to
                                the League it will be desirable that Brazil and the United States
                                agree upon a statement to be published that inasmuch as this has
                                been done our participation has automatically come to an end,
                                although we shall, of course, continue to hope for a successful
                                solution.</p>
                            <p>7. The Secretary General of Foreign Office said today in his judgment
                                there was no likelihood the present mediation or League negotiations
                                would solve the problem and that under certain conditions the best
                                hope might lie in a Brazilian-American effort. Aside from one or two
                                details of procedure his chief thought was that the best hope for a
                                solution lay in holding the negotiations in Washington. He said it
                                would be unwise to have them in Bio de Janeiro as there would be
                                inevitably certain amount of Latin American jealousy which might
                                prove to be an obstacle.</p>

                            <p>60. Foreign Minister was informed by Bolivian Minister in Buenos
                                Aires in message sent yesterday noon that Argentine Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs had then confirmed that good offices of the
                                mediators were virtually suspended out of consideration for League
                                authority and pending League convenience.</p>
                            <p>He also received from Bolivian Minister in Rio de Janeiro last night
                                information that Argentina had stated to Brazil that mediation is
                                suspended “in view of unsatisfactory attitude of Bolivia”.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Minister has instructed Bolivian delegate in Geneva to
                                deliver a statement of the status to the League, probably today.</p>
                            <p>He hopes to see a clear statement from Argentine Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs as to whether mediation suspended or not and whether case is
                                turned over to the League, and if it is so delivered he expects the
                                League to name a commission of the nine countries and hopes the
                                United States will accept such a mandate when offered.</p>

                            <p>226. Bolivian Minister here informed Foreign Office today that
                                Bolivia did not ask the League to postpone action in view of the
                                request made by Lamas to the Bolivian Minister in Buenos Aires on
                                the ground that he, Lamas, was against such postponement. The
                                Foreign Office is inclined to discount this information.</p>

                                <item>Foreign Minister feels that this situation is complicated by
                                    the fact that (despite repeated Brazilian suggestions) Bolivia
                                    has failed to ask, on its own initiative, postponement of League
                                    action. He has the impression that Bolivia, in order to save her
                                    own face, is now trying to promote misunderstanding between
                                    Brazil and Argentina as to responsibility for present
                                    difficulty. He expresses determination not to allow himself to
                                    become involved in difficulty with Argentina on this
                                    subject.</item>

                                    Bolivia will ask League to postpone action. As Brazilian
                                    representations have thus far been ignored he hesitates to try

                                    dealt with by the League without the presence of Brazil and the

                                            a pause is essential. Otherwise failure will result. It
                                            was therefore desirable to take advantage of the meeting
                                            of the Assembly of the League. For this reason Cantilo
                                            stated that the matter was now in the hands of the
                                            League.</item>

                                        <item>Taking account of the effect of Cantilo’s first
                                            speech, he has been instructed to speak again, setting
                                            forth the details of the Argentine proposals, approved
                                            and supported by the United States and Brazil. It is
                                            felt that the League will find the Argentine proposals
                                            so sensible that no improvements can be suggested, and
                                            it is believed that the League will take no initiative
                                            along different lines. If it does it will, of course,
                                            assume all responsibility and will at the same time
                                            afford us an opportunity to determine our own course of

                                mediation without consulting us. They came into this joint effort
                                because of us and I am confident they will not withdraw from it
                                except in agreement with us.</p>
                            <p>There is distinct irritation tinged with discouragement. However, the
                                statement made by the Minister was not based on momentary irritation
                                but on his desire to keep us advised as to his estimate of the
                                situation. He felt, in view of news despatches that Lamas was on his
                                own initiative turning the matter over to the League, that there was
                                a definite possibility the United States and Brazil might find their
                                participation automatically terminated. He also feels there is a
                                possibility that if Lamas continues to act without previous
                                consultation we will sooner or later be involved in embarrassing
                                difficulties.</p>
                            <p>Despite annoyance the Minister has shown restraint and says that
                                Brazil wishes at all costs to avoid antagonizing the Argentine
                                Government. <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0278"/>I have taken
                                the stand throughout that we must exhaust all the possibilities of
                                the present method of negotiation, but the Brazilian attitude has
                                not called for any pressure in this sense. In any event I think you
                                may depend on being fully consulted before any steps will be
                                taken.</p>

                            <p>161. I today discussed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs the
                                contents of the Department’s 109, September 14, 5 p.m. He thinks it
                                unlikely that Paraguay will at least at this time make any
                                “observations and suggestions” but promises to advise me promptly in
                                such event, declaring that he believes the Paraguayan Government to
                                be elated with their recent victories and therefore little disposed
                                for negotiations. He added further that he thinks in neither country
                                is the desire for peace sufficiently “mature” for profitable
                                discussion with them at the moment. He gave me a memorandum which he
                                said summarized his views on the actual situation of the Chaco
                                problem presenting two possible courses.</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Paraguay “1. Renew the negotiations suspended in Buenos Aires
                                    which would probably imply the renewal of anxieties since it
                                    appears that the will to make peace is not ripe on the part of
                                    the belligerents. In any event to take this path it would
                                    necessitate organizing the committee of nine countries with the
                                    hope of giving it greater efficacy.</p>
                                <p>2. To link the negotiations which have been carried out to those
                                    which now pertain to the League in order to strengthen these
                                    activities. This attitude would perhaps be more prudent because
                                    it would make it possible to work through the application of a
                                    definite instrument, as is the League Pact, and would strengthen
                                    the action of the public opinion of a great number of
                                    states.”</p>

                                frankly collaborated in this matter, has kept the League informed
                                concerning the negotiations which have developed. Brazil and the
                                United States, although not members of the League, could not
                                overlook the fact that both belligerents are members thereof and
                                with the Argentine Government have supported the principle that the
                                stipulations of the Pact must be taken into consideration. It was
                                for this reason that at the beginning of the negotiations both
                                countries made the condition that previous advice should be given to
                                the League as for a possible collaboration of the representatives of
                                Brazil and the United States on the conciliation commission which
                                may be appointed in Geneva. That of course is a question which only
                                the interested Governments can determine. It can nevertheless be
                                recalled that a representative of the Washington Government
                                collaborated efficiently on the Council of the League of Nations
                                during the 1932 [<hi rend="italic">1931?</hi>] sessions which were
                                convoked to act on the Manchurian conflict.<note n="40"

                            <p>22. Your 60, September 15, noon. With reference to the hope expressed
                                by Dr. Alvesteguí as reported in the last paragraph of your cable,
                                you should make it immediately clear to the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs that this Government would not accept membership on any
                                Committee appointed by the League to deal with the Chaco problem. It
                                is understood that the views of the Brazilian Government on this
                                point are identical to those of the United States. The friendly and
                                cooperative attitude of the United States towards the activities of
                                the League in dealing with the Chaco problem has been made evident
                                throughout the past year and notably during the course of the
                                Montevideo Conference. During the past 6 months, however, the League
                                suspended all active endeavors to promote peace in the Chaco and it
                                was for that reason that the United States and Brazil actively
                                supported the initiative taken by Argentina in order that the moral
                                influence of this Government might as always continue to be exerted
                                strongly on behalf of peace on the American Continent. Under these
                                conditions, in view of the fact that the present negotiations had
                                reached a point where there appeared to be a hopeful sign of a
                                favorable outcome, this Government is not willing to consider that
                                the present negotiations can be terminated unless the Governments of
                                Bolivia and Paraguay so desire.</p>
                            <p>While in no sense desiring to disparage or to minimize the activities
                                of the League, the Government of the United States believes that
                                under present conditions a peaceful solution of the Chaco dispute
                                may more readily be obtained through the cooperation of some or all
                                of the American Republics.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the second paragraph of your cable, this Government
                                has received no information whatever which would lead it to believe
                                that the Argentine Government has made the statement quoted by you.
                                On the contrary, the American Ambassador in Rio de Janeiro cables
                                that Dr. Saavedra Lamas has informed the Brazilian Government as
                                follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“As the problem is not ripe for solution a pause is
                                        essential. Otherwise failure will result. It was therefore
                                        desirable to take advantage of the meeting of the Assembly
                                        of the League. For this reason Cantilo stated that the
                                        matter was now in the hands of the League. Time having been
                                        gained in this way, it is desirable not to abandon the
                                        common front of the tri-partite mediation. It is felt that
                                        the League will find the Argentine proposals so sensible
                                        that no improvement can <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211"

                            <p>36. Your 42, September 14, 9 a.m. The information contained in your
                                cable has been highly useful to the Department.</p>
                            <p>Please obtain, as soon as may be possible, an interview with
                                President Ayala. You should state that this Government would welcome
                                a frank statement of the position of the Government of Paraguay both
                                with regard to the situation which has now developed at Geneva and
                                more specifically with regard to the suggestions made by Bolivia for
                                modification of the Argentine conciliation formula.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the former question, you should point out that
                                because of the fact that for the past 6 months, the League has
                                refrained from taking any active part in furthering peace in the
                                Chaco, the Government of the United States strongly supported the
                                Argentine peace initiative and has consistently and loyally
                                cooperated with Brazil and Argentina and the two belligerent nations
                                in endeavoring to find a satisfactory ground for adjustment. It has
                                been a matter of particular gratification to this Government that
                                its participation in the negotiations has been so welcome to the
                                Government of Paraguay, Notwithstanding the material difficulties
                                which have been encountered <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0282"
                                />during the course of negotiations, this Government believes that
                                the negotiations had progressed in a satisfactory manner and that
                                the prospects for a successful outcome were bright. Consequently,
                                the Government of the United States will continue in the present
                                negotiations provided Paraguay and Bolivia desire such continuation.
                                It is understood that the attitude of the Government of Brazil will
                                be the same. From a statement recently made by the Argentine
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs, it is understood that it is the strong
                                desire of the Argentine Government that the common front of the
                                tri-partite mediation should not be abandoned.</p>
                            <p>You should then make it clear that while this Government throughout
                                the past year, and notably at Montevideo, has demonstrated an
                                attitude of helpful cooperation towards the activities of the League
                                Committee and does not desire to disparage or minimize in any manner
                                the activities of the League, it believes that under present
                                conditions the solution of the Chaco dispute can more readily be
                                attained through the cooperation of some or all of the American
                                Republics.</p>
                            <p>You may then state that this Government has not as yet been afforded
                                an opportunity of knowing precisely and specifically what the
                                attitude of the Paraguayan Government may be with regard to the
                                Bolivian suggestions for modification of the conciliation formula.
                                You may say that President Ayala’s expressed desire for peace and
                                for guaranties against the renewal of war is, of course, the
                                objective which all of the powers taking part in the present
                                negotiations are seeking, and it is for that reason that this
                                Government believes a clear statement of the feeling of the
                                Paraguayan Government regarding the Bolivian proposals would help
                                materially to clarify the situation and enable the mediating powers
                                to exert their utmost endeavors to find a common ground acceptable
                                to both belligerents. This Government believes that the bases
                                proposed in the Argentine conciliation formula possess the great
                                advantage of making it possible for Bolivia and Paraguay to attempt
                                through conciliation conversations, under the auspices of the
                                friendly powers counselling with them to ascertain whether peace may
                                be obtained through direct negotiations, and, in the event that that
                                should, unfortunately, prove impossible, as the result of prior
                                agreement, to submit the dispute to arbitration. Necessarily, there
                                must be divergent opinions between the two belligerents as to
                                certain technical features of this general proposal and it is, of
                                course, the duty and the obligation of the mediating powers to lend
                                their assistance in solving the questions which so arise. A clear
                                statement of the position of the Government of Paraguay at this time
                                for the confidential information of this Government would enable the
                                United States to make further efforts to exert its influence in a
                                friendly and helpful manner.</p>
                            <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0283"/>
                            <p>For your strictly confidential and personal information. The
                                Department cannot see any particular benefit at this time to be
                                derived from the suggestion advanced to you by President Ayala and
                                reported in the next to the last paragraph of your cable. The
                                Bolivian Government has already indicated its unwillingness to cease
                                hostilities until it is assured of an arbitral agreement.
                                Furthermore, the plan proposed would again bring up for discussion
                                the “security” required by Paraguay. If Paraguay sincerely desires
                                to resort to arbitration in the event that direct negotiations prove
                                impossible, she should be willing now to indicate clearly and
                                precisely what form of arbitration she will accept.</p>

                            <p>228. 1. I have just seen a telegram addressed by Lamas to Cantilo
                                repeated to Argentine Ambassador here. Cantilo is instructed in his
                                next statement to make it clear that he speaks solely on behalf of
                                Argentina as a member of the League and in no way on behalf of
                                Brazil and the United States.</p>
                            <p>2. Bolivian Minister has today submitted to Foreign Office here the
                                text of a telegram sent to the Bolivian delegate in Geneva when the
                                question of postponement first arose, directing him to act in
                                concert with his Argentine colleague with a view to securing
                                postponement. The Minister states that the Bolivian delegate made an
                                effort in this sense but was dissuaded from action by his Argentine
                                colleague. (Foreign Office is disposed to question entire accuracy
                                of this).</p>
                            <p>3. Brazilian Minister in La Paz describes present state of mind of
                                Bolivian Government as one of some bewilderment. He says they have
                                shown him “documentary evidence” to indicate that Lamas has taken
                                different lines in Washington, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; that
                                Washington was given to understand Cantilo had exceeded his
                                instructions and would be reprimanded; in Rio he said Bolivia had
                                not supported the move for League postponement whereas the fact is
                                Bolivia took the initiative but desisted because of Argentine
                                resistance; in Buenos Aires he had taken a different line.</p>
                            <p>4. The Bolivian Government now feels that the various maneuvers of
                                Lamas are aimed at isolating Bolivia and leave her in Geneva in an
                                untenable position.</p>
                            <p>5. Foreign Office is inclined to discount foregoing as it feels that
                                Bolivia had no need to accept Argentine versions on her demand for
                                    <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0284"/>postponement. It is
                                felt that Bolivia has endeavored to use pressure of time element in
                                the hope of maneuvering Brazil and the United States into accepting
                                membership on the League Committee. Bolivian Minister again this
                                afternoon appealed to the Foreign Office that Brazil and the United
                                States should accept membership and was told in clear terms that
                                Brazil had already given a definite answer that she would accept no
                                place on the Committee.</p>
                            <p>6. Some bewilderment has been expressed at Bolivia’s taking a line in
                                Geneva which might result in her being isolated but Foreign Office
                                here feels that she has taken this risk knowingly in her anxiety to
                                avoid going to a conference at Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>7. Brazilian Ambassador in Buenos Aires states Lamas has given to the
                                press his plan and formula. He explained to the Ambassador he had
                                done so because of pressure exerted on him by the press.</p>
                            <p>8. I was told confidentially this afternoon that Foreign Office is
                                convinced Bolivia in an effort to win Brazilian support is resorting
                                to methods which may make for bad feeling between Brazil and
                                Argentina, that being forewarned they are making a special effort to
                                avoid anything which might give Lamas ground for offence or
                                suspicion.</p>

                            <p>111. Your 161, September 17, 6 p.m. Please state to Dr. Saavedra
                                Lamas that this Government has read with the greatest interest his
                                memorandum as transmitted by you. It is felt certain that Dr.
                                Saavedra Lamas recognizes fully the spirit of cooperation and moral
                                support shown by this Government during the past year towards the
                                efforts of the League Chaco Committee. The desire of this Government
                                to support and further efforts for peace in the Chaco, whether
                                emanating from Geneva or from the American Republics, has been
                                repeatedly demonstrated and notably so at the time of the Montevideo
                                Conference. It is believed therefore that he will readily appreciate
                                the fact that this Government is not animated by any spirit of
                                prejudice nor by any desire to minimize or disparage the activities
                                of the League when it expresses the belief that under present
                                conditions, a peaceful solution of the Chaco problem is more likely
                                to be obtained through the cooperation of some or all of the
                                American Republics rather than by a renewal of League activity. You
                                may remind the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it was only after
                                the League had apparently suspended all active participation in
                                promoting a peaceful solution of the Chaco war that this Government
                                accepted the invitation <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0285"/>of
                                Argentina to join with, her and Brazil in support of the Argentine
                                conciliation formula. Since the United States joined with those two
                                nations in the efforts at mediation, she has consistently and
                                untiringly devoted herself to bringing about a common ground between
                                the two belligerents in the belief that the conciliation formula
                                presented by Dr. Saavedra Lamas offered an effective manner of
                                terminating the dispute.</p>
                            <p>The obligations and responsibilities of Argentina, owing to her
                                membership in the League of Nations, are, of course, readily
                                understood by this Government. The United States necessarily
                                believes that the determination of these obligations and
                                responsibilities is solely a matter for Argentina to decide for
                                herself, and should Argentina, in view of her situation, believe it
                                preferable to “link the negotiations which have been carried out to
                                those which now pertain to the League”, this Government would not,
                                of course, question the high motives which might prompt Argentina so
                                to do.</p>
                            <p>This Government, however, is not a member of the League of Nations.
                                As you have been previously informed, the Government of the United
                                States will not accept membership on any committee appointed by the
                                League to deal with the Chaco problem. It would therefore be unable
                                to continue in the present negotiations should these negotiations be
                                amalgamated with negotiations under the jurisdiction of the
                                League.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the United States, for the reasons above set
                                forth, participated in the present negotiations in the belief that
                                its influence and moral support and active participation might be
                                beneficial and conducive to an agreement between Bolivia and
                                Paraguay for a lasting peace. Until recently, these negotiations
                                appeared to offer a favorable prospect for success. In view of these
                                circumstances, the Government of the United States will continue in
                                the present negotiations provided that Bolivia and Paraguay desire
                                such continuation.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Brazil has stated that its policy in this regard
                                was identical with that of the United States. In conclusion, you may
                                state that in the considered judgment of this Government, the bases
                                of settlement offered in the Argentine conciliation formula, with
                                such modifications thereto as the two belligerent nations might by
                                common accord adopt, offer an effective and practical means of
                                obtaining peace. It would, of course, be the purpose of this
                                Government to continue to support that formula, as it has in the
                                past.</p>
                            <p>It is very clear that any conflict of jurisdiction over the Chaco
                                controversy would have highly prejudicial effects. It would seem
                                reasonable to suppose that the League, while technically continuing
                                its own jurisdiction, might refrain from any renewal of activity
                                until <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0286"/>such time as the
                                present negotiations reach a point where it may be ascertained
                                definitely that they will meet with success or be doomed to failure.
                                In the latter event, the League could promptly determine what action
                                it desired to take.</p>

                                a situation as has occurred with the Argentine initiative.</p>
                            <p>He stated he plans to keep the United States informed of
                                developments.</p>

                            <p>43. Department’s telegram No. 36, September 17, 7 p.m. Following is a
                                translation, which has been approved by the President, of a written
                                statement which President Ayala prepared immediately upon my
                                informing him of the Department’s telegram referred to.</p>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“1. After the rejection of the formula proposed by its special
                                    commission of investigation, the League, at the proposal of
                                    Bolivia, examined the possibility of applying article No. 15 of
                                    the Covenant to the Chaco conflict. Paraguay observed that the
                                    said article has for its objective to prevent war and is not
                                    applicable to the case, but in order to show its pacific
                                    disposition, it gave its consent exclusively to the conciliation
                                    procedure established by the said article for the solution of
                                    international differences. This month both parties presented the
                                    memorandum referred to in paragraph 2 of article No. 15.</p>
                                <p>A committee at the seat of the Assembly now is studying the most
                                    effective manner of utilizing the Covenant in the conflict. My
                                    opinion is that the League will not succeed. If Paraguay
                                    complied with the debate in Geneva it is because of the
                                    obligation implied by its character as a member.</p>
                                <p>2. The Argentine formula consists substantially of a meeting of
                                    plenipotentiaries in order to negotiate the immediate and
                                    definite termination of the war, and then the submission of
                                    conflict to the conciliation procedure of the American Anti-War
                                    Pact, and eventually to arbitration. Paraguay accepted the plan
                                    without reservations or modifications. Not so Bolivia, which
                                    presented a counter proposal in which it introduced
                                    modifications which are objectionable to us. The Paraguayan
                                    Government is of the opinion that the Bolivian reservations or
                                    modifications can be examined adequately in the meeting. There
                                    would be serious objection to discussing them prior to that
                                    meeting.</p>
                                <p>No valid reason is given why Bolivia should not attend a meeting,
                                    as Paraguay is willing to do, which does not compromise more
                                    than the good faith of the two countries.</p>
                                <p>3. Paraguay is disposed, as soon as hostilities shall cease, to
                                    examine the questions which separate the two belligerents in a
                                    broad spirit which shall contemplate not only reciprocal
                                    security but also and particularly the future of the two
                                    Republics. Those questions cannot be solved satisfactorily in an
                                    atmosphere of war. The war eliminated, the peace which shall not
                                    imply the imposition of one party on the other will be much
                                    easier.</p>
                                <p>4. If recourse is had to arbitration, there must be arranged by
                                    agreement the usual commitment which shall define the specific
                                    materials of the controversy and other required conditions. In
                                    the negotiation of the commitment, the participation of the
                                    mediators will be useful and necessary and it is not impossible
                                    that an agreement may be reached. But if an agreement upon the
                                    material of the litigation should not be possible, recourse
                                    could be had to the procedure specified <pb n="218"

                                <p>6. Paraguay regards with great satisfaction and hope the
                                    mediation of the United States, Argentine and Brazil. It does
                                    not object to the presence of other American Republics, even
                                    though it believes that the numerous groups may be an obstacle
                                    to a firm and rapid action.</p>
                                <p>7. Any mediators should propose above all the immediate cessation
                                    of the fighting. If there is a sincere desire for peace, the
                                    continuation of hostilities is not justified.”</p>

                                negotiations in which Brazil and the United States are participating
                                are <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0289"/>to be carried on
                                successfully, it would seem advisable that a joint decision be
                                reached by the two Governments as to the course to be pursued
                                immediately after a determination is reached at Geneva as to the
                                exact nature of the League’s activities. The suggestion made by the
                                President of Paraguay that conversations should be commenced between
                                representatives of Bolivia and Paraguay with the participation of
                                the representatives of the mediating powers appears to this
                                Government to offer concrete advantages. It is feared that it might
                                prove a difficult, if not an interminable task to persuade Paraguay
                                to agree to some portion of the modifications of the conciliation
                                formula suggested by Bolivia if such an attempt is made prior to an
                                actual conference. On the other hand, it would be exceedingly
                                difficult for Bolivia now to retreat from the position which she has
                                taken in that regard. There would, however, appear a good ground for
                                hope that in the course of the proposed conference both Bolivia and
                                Paraguay might be persuaded by the mediating powers to agree upon
                                some revised form of the original conciliation formula and likewise
                                to agree upon some arbitral agreement. For obvious reasons, it would
                                further seem desirable to insist that the meeting place of the
                                conference continue to be Buenos Aires, but it would likewise seem
                                advantageous, should such a conference take place, to insist that

                                be represented from the outset in the mediation proceedings.</p>
                            <p>Should the views of the Brazilian Government coincide with the
                                opinions expressed, you may suggest to the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs that as soon as an agreement has been reached between Brazil
                                and the United States, the proposal be laid by the American and
                                Brazilian Ambassadors at Buenos Aires before Dr. Saavedra Lamas.</p>
                            <p>The time element seems now to be of importance and state to the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs that this Government would therefore
                                deeply appreciate receiving the views of his Government at the
                                earliest opportunity.</p>

                            <p>167. I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs Saturday noon and
                                communicated to him the contents of the Department’s 111, September
                                18, 6 p.m. He expressed himself as entirely appreciative of the
                                Department’s viewpoint. He sent me last night a memorandum
                                containing his views on the situation, the essential features of
                                which are as follows:</p>
                            <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0290"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <list>
                                    <item>“1. Having informed the League of its plan, Argentina’s
                                        attitude now is one of waiting.</item>
                                    <item>2. Argentina does not feel bound in any way by the above
                                        action nor through any stipulation of the League Covenant,
                                        to limit itself in following the shortest and most effective
                                        way toward peace in the Chaco.</item>
                                    <item>3. With regard to the League and the countries exercising
                                        their good offices, Argentina suggests two ways of ending
                                        the conflict: (1) to have the League appoint a conciliatory
                                        commission as some of its members seem to be inclined to do;
                                        (2) to have the League declare its decision to abstain for a
                                        time in order to allow the countries that are exercising
                                        their good offices to continue to do so with the
                                        understanding that should these negotiations prove
                                        ineffectual after a certain period the League would resume
                                        its own action.</item>
                                    <item>4. Should the League adopt the first proposition and
                                        include Argentina on the commission Argentina will consult
                                        the American countries with which it shared the exercise of
                                        good offices as to the line of action to be followed.</item>
                                    <item>5. Should the League abstain permitting the American
                                        countries to act it would be advisable to bring about direct
                                        conversations between the belligerents under the auspices of
                                        the mediators or from now on to include their action with
                                        that of the nine countries. This requires preliminary
                                        discussions before invitations are extended to them for the
                                        reason that in the prevailing opinion the opportune time has
                                        not arrived due to the military illusions of the
                                        belligerents.”</item>
                                </list>
                            </quote>
                            <p>The memorandum concludes with the declaration that the Argentine
                                Chancellery has an open mind to receive whatever line of argument
                                the United States or Brazil may care to submit, with which
                                countries’ heads it intends to continue the joint action and is
                                disposed to continue it conjointly and preferably.</p>

                            <p>242. Department’s 133, September 21, 6 p.m. Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs states that since the outset it has been the Brazilian view
                                that (1) the conference should be held at Buenos Aires and (2) that
                                the nine powers should be invited to participate; (3) that it was at
                                the request of Argentina, in which we acquiesced, that Brazil
                                consented to preliminary mediation by the three powers, but always
                                with the idea that definite conciliation negotiations would be
                                carried out by the nine at Buenos Aires.</p>
                            <p>The Brazilian Government is therefore in complete accord with your
                                present view as to procedure.</p>
                            <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0291"/>
                            <p>It is understood, of course, that the foregoing is contingent upon
                                postponement or abandonment of League action. However, in the
                                meantime the Foreign Office is telegraphing the Brazilian Ambassador
                                in Buenos Aires stating that it is in full agreement with the
                                American Government as to the course outlined in your 133, and
                                directing him to consult and act in concert with his American
                                colleague.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Office further proposes, if you see no objection, that the
                                Brazilian and American Ambassadors in Buenos Aires be directed to
                                call on Lamas and say to him that our two countries came into this
                                mediation at his request and have sought to support his efforts
                                effectively; that we now feel certain misgivings as to the best
                                course because of our uncertainty as to what the League is going to
                                do; that we would therefore appreciate a definite statement from him
                                as to whether (1) he proposes to secure postponement of League
                                action and continue tripartite mediation, whether he proposes to
                                turn question over to the League, that in the former case we should
                                be glad to continue cooperating with him and we make the definite
                                proposal that the conference of nine be convened at Buenos Aires; in
                                the second case, that we are reluctant to do anything that might be
                                construed as competition with the League and that we will therefore
                                withdraw from the picture temporarily at least.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Office feels that unless we take this course we may risk
                                becoming involved in unpleasant complications.</p>

                                any further specific peace initiative at the present time might not
                                tend to confuse the various proposals and possibly prevent any of

                                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I thank Your Excellency
                                    sincerely for your communication of September 12, 1934, in
                                    furtherance of the earnest interest which both our Governments
                                    have in the prompt termination of the hostilities which
                                    unfortunately exist between Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>
                                <p>I fully share your deep regret at the continuation of this tragic
                                    struggle, and have read with great interest your suggestion that
                                    the nations represented at Washington, in agreement with the Pan
                                    American Union and in the name of all the American Governments,
                                    propose as soon as possible to the Governments of Paraguay and
                                    Bolivia, on the bases that they may consider suitable, the
                                    acceptance of an armistice for a minimum period of a year, or
                                    for such time as may be considered sufficient, for those
                                    countries to study a just and friendly solution of their
                                    differences.</p>
                                <p>As you will recollect, the nations represented at the Montevideo
                                    Conference in December, 1933, bent every effort to obtain the
                                    consent of the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay to an
                                    extended armistice for the purpose of allowing those Governments
                                    to compose their difference. Unfortunately, although the
                                    armistice was accepted, its duration was not sufficient to
                                    permit a solution of the basic problem or to prevent the
                                    resumption of hostilities.</p>
                                <p>I am glad to inform you in response to your proposal that, as
                                    this Government has repeatedly stated in the past, it will
                                    always be ready to support any initiative looking towards peace
                                    on this continent, provided the participation of the United
                                    States in such initiative prove agreeable to the belligerent
                                    nations, and further provided that such initiative in the
                                    judgment of this Government give promise of success.</p>
                                <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                                    printed.</note> For some time past the Department has believed
                                that the Chilean Foreign Office has felt increasing resentment
                                because of the supposed exclusion of Chile from the mediation
                                negotiations dealing with the Chaco problem. Throughout the course
                                of the negotiations the Department has impressed upon the Chilean
                                    <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0293"/>Embassy here the fact
                                that both this Government and Brazil had insisted that if and when
                                some concrete basis for agreement between Bolivia and Paraguay were
                                reached the other members of the original group of nine should
                                immediately be called in to join in the mediation and that as soon
                                as practicable thereafter all of the republics of the continent
                                should be invited to lend their active and moral support to further
                                the cause of peace in the Chaco. Upon receipt of the message from
                                the Chilean Foreign Minister referred to in your cable, the Chilean
                                Ambassador here was reminded of these facts. He was also reminded of
                                the consistently cooperative attitude demonstrated by this
                                Government towards Chile, notably when the incident between Chile
                                and Paraguay arose, and he was further informed that every
                                suggestion made by Chile had received the fullest and most friendly
                                consideration and that while the Department regretted that it could
                                not accede to the suggestion offered by the Chilean Government that
                                the United States accept membership in the League subcommittee, it
                                had, nevertheless, explained in considerable detail how it was
                                disposed to cooperate with such a committee should conditions in the
                                judgment of the United States make such cooperation feasible and of
                                practical value. The Chilean Ambassador in Washington appeared to
                                take a completely reasonable and understanding attitude and promised
                                to transmit the views expressed by cable to Cruchaga and to add that
                                this Government would gladly welcome any expression of opinion from
                                Cruchaga concerning the present situation and the manner in which
                                the friendly assistance of the United States might continue to be
                                rendered to promote an early settlement of the Chaco situation.</p>
                            <p>In view of the erroneous press statements recently published, it is
                                obviously undesirable for the United States to take any initiative
                                in the matter at this time. It seems to be clear that neither
                                Paraguay nor Bolivia have any hope of obtaining effective action in
                                Geneva and are once more looking to this continent for assistance in
                                reaching an agreement. The views of the Paraguayan Government have
                                already been made completely clear in communications received from
                                Asunción and the Bolivian Minister in Washington yesterday inquired
                                by instruction of his Government what the mediating nations now
                                proposed to do. He further stated that his Government would gladly
                                welcome a renewal of the efforts to promote peace on the part of the
                                American nations. He emphasized in particular the view of the
                                Bolivian Government that the mediation negotiations had never
                                terminated and that a continuation of such negotiations was not
                                incompatible with the activities of the League.</p>
                            <p>The Department would be glad to have you discuss the situation very
                                frankly with the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs and explain
                                why the United States does not desire at this time to take the lead
                                in <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0294"/>any possible resumption
                                of mediation negotiations, although should conditions so develop
                                that Brazil and Argentina believe that the time is propitious for
                                inviting the remaining members of the nine powers to join in
                                resuming mediation efforts through a conciliation conference, this
                                Government will be glad to lend its assistance and active
                                cooperation to such end.</p>
                            <p>The Brazilian Government has been in complete accord with the United
                                States from the commencement of these negotiations in endeavoring to
                                prevent the creation of the belief that the two Governments were
                                assisting the creation of a bloc on this continent. It is for that
                                reason, particularly in view of Cruchaga’s comments in this regard,
                                that it is desirable not to renew mediation negotiations without the
                                cordial participation and cooperation of the other members of the
                                original group of nine. There further seems to be growing on the
                                part of certain of the smaller republics of the continent the belief
                                that they are being disregarded in these peace movements. It is
                                therefore equally desirable that steps be taken in the event that
                                negotiations are resumed to dissipate this feeling in every
                                appropriate manner at the opportune time.</p>

                            <p>272. I went over the Department’s 151, October 9, 5 p.m., with Acting
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning. He assures me that the
                                Brazilian Government is in full agreement on every point raised by
                                you. He quite understands Department’s reluctance to take any
                                initiative at the present time, and in any event feels that it would
                                be wiser for the mediating powers to wait developments for the
                                reasons stated in my 256, October 1, 9 p.m.;<note n="48"

                                parties approach us they might well be told that the League action
                                must be terminated or at least clarified in such a way as to justify
                                our taking new steps before we could consider any resumption of good
                                offices. He is in agreement as to the necessity for including the
                                other members of the original group of nine in any resumption of
                                negotiations. This view he had already expressed (see my 250,

                                    printed.</note> Telegram to Brazilian Embassy in Santiago sent
                                yesterday as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Brazilian Government, complying with the urgent appeal
                                        of the American Government, decided on July 14th last to
                                        support the conciliation formula proposed by Saavedra Lamas,
                                        on the understanding that it would take no initiative and
                                        that after acceptance of the formula by the belligerent
                                        countries the other countries of the group of nine would be
                                        invited to participate in the conciliation conference.
                                        Therefore, without the effective collaboration of the
                                        Government of Chile, nothing could be done. We could not
                                        have thought of going ahead without being able to count upon
                                        the collaboration of Chile, which we considered a <hi
                                            rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> for the final success of
                                        our efforts for the restoration of peace on this
                                        continent.</p>
                                    <p>The selection of Buenos Aires as the seat of the conference
                                        was quite natural in view of the fact that the preliminary
                                        negotiations now under way were initiated by the Argentine
                                        Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                                    <p>With reference to the League intervention in the subject, our
                                        position is perfectly clear. We were sounded by Avenol as to
                                        whether we would accept membership on a commission set up
                                        under League auspices. We replied on September 1st that,
                                        Brazil not being a member of the League, we did not desire
                                        to accept a place in the committee, and we also thought that
                                        the moment was inopportune for any intervention on the part
                                        of the League. We have not modified our attitude in this
                                        respect nor do we expect to do so in the future.</p>
                                    <p>Apart from the League of Nations, we are still disposed to
                                        lend our efforts in the noble work of putting an end to the
                                        inglorious Chaco War and to attain this objective we hope
                                        that we can always count with [<hi rend="italic">upon?</hi>]
                                        the decided and loyal support of Minister Cruchaga.</p>
                                    <p>We can affirm that the Government of the United States
                                        pursues the same course.</p>
                                    <p>You are instructed to furnish the substance of this telegram
                                        to Minister Cruchaga.”</p>

                            <p>288. Bolivian Minister yesterday told Minister for Foreign Affairs he
                                was convinced that if he and the Paraguayan Minister could meet
                                informally in company with the Foreign Minister and the American <pb
                                    n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0296"/>Ambassador they would be
                                able to come to a prompt agreement on a formula. At his request,
                                Foreign Minister broached the subject to the Paraguayan Minister,
                                who agreed and has submitted the proposal to his Government for
                                approval.</p>
                            <p>The Paraguayan Minister said he felt his Government would consider it
                                desirable to include the Argentine Ambassador. The Foreign Minister
                                feels that this is desirable in order that it may be clear in Buenos
                                Aires that this is merely a friendly exploration, and incidentally
                                because the Argentine Ambassador here is steady [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >ready?</hi>] and anxious for agreement.</p>
                            <p>In talking to both Ministers, Dr. Macedo Soares made it clear that if
                                agreement were reached through any such conversations it must be
                                understood in advance that the conciliation conference itself would
                                take place in Buenos Aires as planned.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he was convinced there was a
                                real possibility of “surprising results”. One of the chief obstacles
                                has been the Bolivian claim to a plot on the Paraguay River south of
                                Bahia Negra, and he is convinced from what he has learned that if
                                this is put forward by Bolivia Paraguayan authorities will agree in
                                order to bring about an immediate cessation of hostilities, which is
                                now the chief Paraguayan desideratum.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister says that if agreement can thus be reached on a
                                formula which permits the early convening of the conciliation
                                conference, the Bolivian Government will be able without losing face
                                to withdraw the whole question now pending at Geneva on the ground
                                that through fortunate developments agreement has been reached by
                                direct negotiations.</p>
                            <p>The Department will recall that both the Bolivian and Paraguayan
                                Ministers, before their recent arrival at this post, were the
                                Ministers for Foreign Affairs in their respective countries and are
                                thoroughly familiar with the whole problem.</p>
                            <p>It is the idea of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to invite the two
                                Ministers to tea at his home with the Argentine and American
                                Ambassadors in order that the meeting may be as unofficial as
                                possible and leave them to work out their own course. He has made
                                clear to both Ministers that if we accept their proposal to act as
                                friendly witnesses they must not expect us to exercise anything more
                                than helping and moderating influence.</p>

                                authorization to Argentine Ambassador to participate the latter has
                                now called with a long telegram from Saavedra Lamas in which he
                                reopens the whole question and states that (chiefly in view of the
                                dangers of eventual publicity) he has serious scruples about any
                                action outside of the League of Nations. His message ends with the
                                statement that under the circumstances Argentina is unable to
                                participate.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister has kept away from the Foreign Office but
                                yesterday the Secretary General cornered him and asked about the
                                reply from his Government. The Minister gave no direct answer but
                                went into elaborate explanations as to the difficulty of Bolivian
                                acceptance, the necessity for adhering to League procedure, et
                                cetera.</p>
                            <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0298"/>
                            <p>Under directions from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary
                                General has now told the Bolivian Minister that the Brazilian
                                Government washes its hands of the whole subject; that if at any
                                future time he wants to bring the matter up again he must do so in
                                writing and with definite guarantee that his Government will stand
                                hitched.</p>

                                    ruined the well-being of Bolivia and Paraguay, plunges all the

                                    earnestly desire the reconciliation of those two countries

                                    to the end that Bolivia and Paraguay concert a new armistice for
                                    a period sufficiently long to allow them, free from warlike
                                    excitement, to arrive at an honorable arrangement, putting an

                                    alienated the one from the other.</p>

                                    fraternity, from most of the countries addressed, and being

                                    with sympathy and benevolent approval, a sympathy and approval
                                    which will encourage us to continue the negotiation initiated, I

                                through the Diplomatic Representatives accredited to Washington in

                            <p>The conscience of the whole continent has expressed itself in favor
                                of an effective peace, these sentiments having been clearly shown on
                                various occasions. One of the historical attitudes of most
                                importance was without any doubt the action taken through the Pan
                                American Congress of Montevideo—referred to by Your Excellency—which
                                achieved the concerting of a truce inspired by the same purpose
                                which this chancellery has set forth, which truce, however, was
                                unfortunately not long enough to produce an atmosphere of serenity
                                favorable to the understanding which we anxiously desire.</p>
                            <p>I am informed by Your Excellency’s interesting note under reference
                                of the broad spirit of cooperation which prevails in the spirit of
                                your enlightened Government whenever there is a question of the
                                promotion of peace on this continent, and subject to the
                                understanding that the participation of the United States may—as I
                                hope—be agreeable to the nations interested, your country reserving
                                its decision with a view to the probabilities of success which the
                                negotiations may promise.</p>
                            <p>In expressing to Your Excellency the most profound gratitude for the
                                generous demonstration of solidarity which your reply signifies in
                                relation to the desires of a perpetual peace in the Chaco, I have

                            <p>302. My 300, October 25, 6 p.m. Bolivian Minister who evidently wants
                                to keep door open now states that his Government will only today
                                receive an air mail letter in which he explained the whole scheme

                            <p>162. Your 302, October 27, noon. The American Consul at Geneva cabled
                                under date of October 26th,<note n="55" xml:id="d284fn55">Telegram
                                    No. 303, not printed.</note> that Avenol on that date, assuming
                                that conciliation negotiations were continuing on this Continent,
                                expressed the hope that the bases for such an attempted settlement
                                and those which will be expressed in the final report of the
                                Assembly would not present divergencies sufficient to permit the two
                                disputants to seek recourse to separate jurisdictions. He admitted
                                that in the absence of a Paraguayan representative, conciliation in
                                Geneva was in fact a failure, adding that the justification of a
                                continuity of <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> conciliatory attempts
                                in Geneva was that the League should not be regarded as not having
                                made every effort. Avenol further stated that were conciliation
                                attained elsewhere before November 20th, it might obviate the
                                convening of the extraordinary session of the Assembly.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Government, through its Ambassador here, has
                                communicated a message giving its views on the present situation
                                which are approximately the same as those communicated to the
                                Brazilian Foreign Office. While the unwillingness of the Argentine
                                Government to foster conversations in Rio is based officially upon
                                that Government’s alleged desire to avoid any conflict of
                                jurisdiction with the League at this time, it is clear from between
                                the lines of the message received by the Argentine Ambassador that
                                the more material objection is the transfer of the seat of these
                                conversations from Buenos Aires to Rio. Saavedra Lamas suggested to
                                the Department that any further conciliatory action be postponed
                                until the League had “spent itself.”</p>
                            <p>Both the Bolivian Minister here and the Bolivian Minister in Rio are
                                apparently urgently desirous that conversations proceed in Rio as
                                originally planned. The Bolivian Foreign Minister apparently,
                                however, fears jeopardizing the position of Bolivia in Geneva and
                                the approaching elections in Bolivia are likewise clearly an
                                obstacle to the taking of any positive action by Bolivia at this
                                moment. If, for any reason, however, the attitude of the Bolivian
                                Government should change and the Bolivian Minister in Rio were
                                formally instructed by <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0302"/>his
                                Government to proceed with the conversations, this Government would
                                be glad to further them in every appropriate manner, provided, of
                                course, that the Brazilian Government maintains its present
                                announced willingness that the seat of the conversations be
                                transferred to Buenos Aires should any concrete formula develop
                                therefrom.</p>

                            <p>306. Department’s 162, October 29, 5 p.m. Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs took occasion some days ago to impress on the Argentine
                                Ambassador that in discussions with the Bolivian and Paraguayan
                                representatives he had made it clear that should any formula be
                                evolved in the proposed conversations the ensuing conference must be
                                held in Buenos Aires. The Minister further stated that the Brazilian
                                Government had accepted an invitation to a conference in Buenos
                                Aires and felt that the terms of the invitation should be adhered
                                to; second, that Brazil had recently had one long-drawn-out
                                conference and could not afford another one; third, that under no
                                condition would she consent to a transfer of the conference from
                                Buenos Aires to Rio unless an unexpected situation arose where the
                                Argentine as well as the other interested Governments definitively
                                asked for Brazilian hospitality.</p>
                            <p>It is felt that there can now be no room for misunderstanding as to
                                Brazilian intentions. The Secretary General of the Foreign Office
                                tells me that their views as to the present situation are in full
                                harmony with those expressed in your telegram.</p>

                                Paz, the first received last Saturday. For some reason he has not
                                yet communicated them to the Foreign Office but has an appointment
                                there this evening.</p>
                            <p>The first message stated that although the Bolivian Government cannot
                                foresee much hope of a solution through direct conversations, in
                                order to show its good will it authorized him to participate therein
                                in the presence of the representatives of the United States and
                                Brazil.</p>

                                Department’s interest expressed by Mr. Welles in exploring the
                                possibilities of agreement through such conversations.</p>
                            <p>The Minister added that in his opinion there was very little hope of
                                agreement inasmuch as the points of view are too radically
                                different.</p>

                            <p>163. The Minister of Bolivia has informed the Department today by
                                instruction of his Government that the Bolivian Minister in Rio de
                                Janeiro has been instructed to inform the Brazilian Government of
                                the desire of Bolivia to participate in the suggested conversations
                                to be held with the Minister of Paraguay in Rio de Janeiro with the
                                assistance of the Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                                yourself and the Argentine Ambassador, provided the latter is
                                permitted to do so by his own Government.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister further states that the Argentine Minister in
                                La Paz requested an audience with President Salamanca 2 days ago in
                                the course of which the former stated that the Argentine Government
                                desired to know whether the Bolivian Government was disposed once
                                more to consider peace proposals which the Argentine Government was
                                prepared to make to Paraguay and to Bolivia. During this
                                conversation no mention whatever was made of Brazil or the United
                                States. The Bolivian President replied that the Bolivian Government
                                was now as always prepared to consider any peace proposals that
                                might be suggested to it.</p>
                            <p>Please cable the Department whether the Bolivian Minister in Rio de
                                Janeiro has as yet complied with the instructions referred to in the
                                first paragraph and if so, what the present disposition of the
                                Brazilian Government may be.</p>

                            <p>310. My 309 November 6, 6 p.m., Department’s 163, November 6, 7 p.m.
                                Bolivian Minister called on Minister for Foreign Affairs last night
                                and communicated to him first message referred to in my telegram.
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Bolivian acceptance <pb
                                    n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0304"/>would have been more
                                welcome several weeks ago; that there was not time for reaching any
                                solution within the few days remaining before the special League
                                Assembly.</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister fell back on an inquiry as to whether Brazil
                                and the United States would renew the suggestion of direct
                                conversations in case the League failed to find a solution. Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs said that if that situation arose he felt it
                                would be unwise for Brazil and the United States to grant friendly
                                good offices in connection with direct conversations except in
                                response to a specific request from both the belligerents. The
                                Bolivian Minister asked whether Brazil and the United States could
                                not take the initiative and was told by the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs that while no answer could be given to such a hypothetical
                                question, he felt that our recent experience had demonstrated that
                                it would be wiser to act only in response to specific requests from
                                both parties.</p>
                            <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has received word from La Paz in
                                regard to the Argentine overtures in substantial agreement with the
                                facts given in the Department’s telegram.</p>
                            <p>In view of the discrepancy between the statements in the Department’s
                                telegram and mine as to whether the Bolivian proposal envisaged the
                                presence of the Argentine representative at direct conversations
                                here, I inquired as to what the Bolivian Minister had said last
                                night. Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me that he made no mention
                                of the Argentine in that connection.</p>

                            <p>164. Your 310, November 7, 3 p.m. The Argentine Ambassador called
                                this morning to inform the Department, by instruction of Saavedra
                                Lamas, that the latter had instructed the Argentine Ministers in La
                                Paz and Asunción a few days ago to sound out the Bolivian and
                                Paraguayan Governments in order to ascertain whether they would be
                                favorable to renewed peace proposals. In each case, the reply was
                                stated to have been favorable. Saavedra Lamas stated that what he
                                had in mind was a renewal of the mediation negotiations along the
                                lines previously agreed upon in the event that the League efforts
                                proved unsuccessful.</p>

                            <p>313. The Bolivian Minister called this morning and in the course of
                                reviewing past negotiations at some length, evidently for my benefit
                                as a newcomer, went into the chronology of communications between
                                him and his Government with the object of showing that the delay in
                                communicating to Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs Bolivian
                                Government’s consent to direct conversations with Paraguayan
                                Minister here was due to unavoidable physical causes (including
                                Brazilian Minister for Foreign Affairs’ absence from Rio over long
                                week end, see Embassy’s 309, November 6, 6 p.m.). Bolivian Minister
                                consequently was not inclined to cavil at the reception given to the
                                message from his Government and said that he now presumed that
                                direct conversations were out of the picture for the time being.</p>
                            <p>He declared that personally he was convinced that Geneva would fail
                                to find a solution, and that he hoped such failure would be
                                definitely established before the end of the year in order that
                                mediation along the lines previously pursued, essential to the
                                reaching of a permanent solution, could be resumed.</p>
                            <p>Bolivian Minister volunteered that the Argentine overtures in La Paz
                                (your 163, November 6, 7 p.m.) mentioned “a new mediation” without
                                indicating what countries other than Argentina were supposed to
                                participate.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally Bolivian Minister stated that his recent instructions
                                concerning participation in direct conversations with the Minister
                                of Paraguay here contained no mention as to the presence of the
                                Argentine representative (Department’s 163, November 6, 7 p.m.;
                                Embassy’s 310, November 7, 3 p.m., last paragraph).</p>
                            <p>The Bolivian Minister proffered the view that the Liberal Party
                                candidate had a fair chance at Sunday’s coming elections; he added
                                that although the opposing political parties did not overtly differ
                                on the question of the Chaco it was well understood that the
                                Liberals if successful, while still insisting upon the soundness of
                                Bolivia’s legal position, would be prepared to make practical
                                concessions.</p>
                            <p>I saw the Paraguayan Minister this afternoon who agreed that direct
                                conversations were now out of the question. He said that he favored
                                a resumption of mediation along lines previously pursued but
                                professed more impatience than the Bolivian Minister at the prospect
                                of their resumption being delayed until it becomes clear that Geneva
                                cannot proceed further with hope of effective results; he felt that
                                Geneva would resort to various procedures consuming much time before
                                such a stage could be said to have been reached.</p>

                                stated that now any peace must take the past [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >sic</hi>] situation into account. While the Paraguayan attitude
                                will be stiffened by military successes there are also important
                                factors working for peace. I have been unofficially informed that it
                                is possible that an effort may be made to establish contact between
                                the two belligerents for the purpose of exploring the possibility of
                                direct negotiations. See air mail despatch No. 128 sent today.<note

                                    same subject, for which I thank you.</p>
                                <p>As Your Excellency is already aware, this Government stands ready
                                    to support any move acceptable to the parties to the dispute
                                    which, in its judgment, offers reasonable hope for success. My
                                    Government would be most happy were the initiative taken by El
                                    Salvador to result in ending the state of war which unhappily
                                    exists between two of our sister nations. Accordingly, and in
                                    harmony with the views which the Minister of the United States
                                    in El Salvador expressed under instructions to your Government
                                    on October 5, 1934, this Government would be happy to lend its
                                    cooperation, in due time, should Your Excellency’s proposal
                                    prosper, and should the proposal prove acceptable to the
                                    Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay.</p>

                                the Council this morning he intended to oppose postponement of

                                the matter is too pressing for delay. He will propose complete arms

                            <p>2. He said that the Secretariat had reason to hope that the Argentine
                                Government would acquiesce. The embargo, is, of course, contingent
                                on agreement on the part of all exporting countries. He realizes
                                that under present conditions the embargo cannot be made effective
                                as far as the United States is concerned but hopes that you may see

                                last night by telephone with London and longer warning had therefore
                                not been possible.</p>

                                    printed.</note> and Wilson’s 254, May 17, 9 a.m.</p>
                            <p>1. The following is a summary of the British representative’s
                                statement proposing an arms embargo: The British Government endorses
                                “the general conclusions to be drawn from the Chaco Commission’s
                                report” and in particular considers that the draft treaty proposed
                                by the Commission is an “honorable solution” and urges the two
                                parties to reexamine and accept it.</p>
                            <p>Eden then referred to an arms embargo as offering an effective means
                                of contributing to the cessation of hostilities. He recalled the
                                negotiations for an embargo initiated by the British in a note to
                                the Secretary General under date of February 25, 1933.<note n="63"
                                    xml:id="d294fn63">See League of Nations, <hi rend="italic"
                                        >Official Journal</hi>, April 1933, p. 632.</note> These
                                negotiations had been suspended because of the proposals made for a
                                commission of inquiry. It was now urgently necessary to resume these
                                negotiations and he proposed that the Council “send telegrams at
                                once to the 17 Governments whose cooperation is necessary to inquire
                                whether they are prepared to agree to the arms embargo proposal.” He
                                added: “It may be in some instances that Governments have not at
                                this moment the necessary powers to put an embargo into effect;
                                where this is so His Majesty’s Government trusts that it may be
                                found possible to take necessary legislative action as an emergency
                                measure.” He then urged the neighboring countries to forbid the
                                transit of war supplies to the belligerents.</p>

                                reference) the President will set as early a date as possible for
                                its discussion. He requested the Committee of Three to follow the
                                matter in the interval with the assistance when desired of the
                                members of the Chaco Commission.</p>

                                <item>The Council this morning authorized the Committee of Three to
                                    obtain the collaboration of jurists to frame a suggestion for a
                                    procedure to give effect to the British proposals for an arms
                                    embargo. I understood that the juridical point more particularly
                                    involved is the question of taking Council action without the
                                    consent of the two disputants.</item>

                                <item>The Danish representative supported embargo proposal stating
                                    that it was in accord with the laws already in force in his
                                    country prohibiting shipments of arms to countries at war or
                                    involved in a conflict threatening to lead to war.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The conclusion ended with a statement by the Bolivian
                                    representative in which he maintained an embargo imposed equally
                                    on both parties might in effect result in injustice due to the
                                    less favorable geographical position of one of the parties
                                    respecting obtaining of arms. This would be tantamount to the
                                    application of sanctions to the more isolated party. He referred
                                    to Bolivia’s position on this question at the Havana Conference
                                    stating that it was supported by the American Delegation.<note

                            <p>85. 1. The following appear to me to be the chief factors which
                                governed the Council action in the Bolivia–Paraguay dispute
                                described in my 83, May 19, 10 p.m.<note n="65" xml:id="d296fn65"

                            <p>From a technical point of view this procedure was devised to escape
                                the difficulties under the unanimity rule (article 11 of the
                                    Covenant<note n="66" xml:id="d296fn66"><hi rend="italic"

                                adverse positions certain to be taken either by Bolivia or Paraguay
                                or by both.</p>
                            <p>More fundamental political considerations were, however, undoubtedly
                                operative. Opposition developed to such a sanction as the proposed
                                embargo being taken against both of the belligerents as <pb n="240"
                                    xml:id="pg_240" facs="0310"/>contravening the prevalent
                                conception that the value of sanctions as an element of security
                                lies in their special applicability against the belligerent which
                                has been determined to be the aggressor or otherwise primarily
                                responsible for a conflict. It is, of course, evident that in this
                                case the Chaco Commission had in effect placed the blame equally on
                                both disputants and thus sanctions might in such circumstances be
                                invoked against both and still presumably be in harmony with this
                                conception. Nevertheless, such action was opposed as creating a
                                precedent tending to undermine this principle. Czechoslovak
                                officials expressed this view frankly in informal conversations and
                                presumably advanced it officially in private discussions. It appears
                                that Italy also supports this general contention. To what extent
                                Czechoslovakia in this also reflects the views of other League
                                states is not clear but probably at least the other Little Entente
                                countries. In any event, aside from the opposition of the disputants
                                it would probably have been impossible to obtain direct and
                                unanimous Council action on the embargo proposal.</p>
                            <p>There are also intimations that these and perhaps other states are
                                for commercial considerations unfavorable to an embargo and some
                                doubt is even expressed as to whether certain states will give
                                completely acquiescent reply to the Committee of Three’s telegram.
                                The best opinion appears to be, however, that such states will stop
                                short of being placed in an isolated position in such a
                                connection.</p>

                            <p>89. I have been informed by responsible Secretariat officials as
                                follows: </p>
                            <p>1. Respecting the preoccupations of certain League states described
                                in my No. 85, May 19, midnight, third paragraph, the endeavor of the
                                Secretariat will be to discount such contentions by stressing the
                                special character of the Bolivia–Paraguay situation with particular
                                reference to the statements respecting an aggressor on page 52 of
                                the Commission’s report (Consulate’s despatch 907, political, of May
                                15, 1934<note n="69" xml:id="d299fn69">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                            <p>I am informed that this element of the report was written with this
                                present exigency in mind.</p>
                            <p>2. Consulate’s 88, May 22, 2 p.m. paragraph 1. <list>

                                    <item>It will be noted that Japan is omitted. Japan was not
                                        approached last year to avoid probable unsuccessful results
                                        due to her special and adverse position vis-à-vis the League
                                        at that time. For similar reasons it is hoped that no state
                                        will now make its acceptance contingent on that of
                                        Japan.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>The same hope is expressed respecting Soviet Russia which
                                        is likewise omitted.</item>
                                    <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                    <item>German action is regarded as very uncertain and it is
                                        therefore desired that as few states as possible will make
                                        their present action contingent on Germany’s.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>3. It is noted that should all producing states place an embargo on
                                exports the action of the bordering states would not be necessary
                                and conversely the prohibition of transit and reexport by the
                                neighboring states would be sufficient without action by the
                                producing states.</p>
                            <p>It is particularly desired to avoid each of these groups endeavoring
                                to delay action by placing the chief responsibility upon the
                                other.</p>
                            <p>4. From the position which Bolivia appears to be taking respecting
                                the embargo (Consulate’s No. 80, May 18, 3 p.m. paragraph 3) it is
                                believed that Bolivia may adopt the immediate strategy at the
                                extraordinary meeting of the Council of accepting the Commission’s
                                report thus placing Paraguay in an unfavorable position as
                                juridically the state upon which pressure should alone be
                                placed.</p>
                            <p>Although obviously this would have a direct relationship to the
                                embargo question, Secretariat opinion has not gone further than
                                that, under the conditions which would thus be created the question
                                would have to be considered anew.</p>
                            <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0313"/>
                            <p>5. Although the League authorities perhaps naturally do not express
                                themselves as pessimistic respecting the receipt of favorable
                                replies to the proposals, nevertheless, they appear to be definitely
                                sceptical as to the outcome in the face of the obvious and
                                complicated difficulties which I have discussed.</p>

                            <p>90. 1. League authorities have imparted to me in strict confidence
                                the positions which were taken by the states concerned vis-à-vis the
                                embargo proposals of 1933 (Consulate’s 88, May 22, 2 p.m., paragraph
                                1) as follows: China, Spain, Guatemala, Ireland,
                                Mexico—unconditional acceptance.</p>
                            <p>China, however, suggested that embargo be provisional and should be
                                lifted as regards the party which might eventually conform to the

                                acceptances secured last year to the embargo proposal. Germany was
                                particularly considered in this connection.</p>

                            <p>40. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has just informed me by
                                memorandum that his Government has replied to the League of Nations
                                that Uruguay will join in the measures upon which the Council of the
                                League may agree concerning an embargo on arms to the Chaco
                                belligerents but that such embargo to be effective should be with
                                the acquiescence of the bordering countries. The memorandum
                                continues that notwithstanding the foregoing and being aware of our
                                proposed legislation in this regard the Uruguayan Minister at
                                Washington will be telegraphically informed that this Government is
                                desirous of knowing our thought in the matter in order to assure a
                                harmonious attitude on Uruguay’s part, which is all the more
                                necessary because Uruguay is convinced that the cooperation of the
                                United States is indispensable to the efficacy of the measures
                                proposed by the British representative on the Council of the

                                reply to the embargo communication. They feel, nevertheless, that
                                Germany might yet reply at least in some terms in view of the
                                circumstances that the communication was signed by Najera and that

                                without my making direct inquiries Yokoyama stated to me that he had
                                had no exchanges with Tokyo on the subject of the proposed arms
                                embargo, that he was merely waiting to note whether any other state
                                made its action contingent on that of Japan and that in such event
                                he would confine his action solely to notifying his Government. He
                                added that he had no idea as to what his Government’s policy would

                                any other state not yet approached) be so named the procedure would
                                undoubtedly be that a communication would be forwarded to the

                            <p>5. Responsible Secretariat officials are very pessimistic respecting
                                the successful issue of the embargo efforts on two scores; (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>)—the apparent attitude of the bordering
                                states in the matter of the “transit treaties” with the
                                belligerents; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)—the large number of states
                                on whose action so many states are making theirs contingent.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the latter they see in this naming of so many other
                                states a definite policy to avoid taking action on the embargo. They
                                see these states as inspired by the expectation that some of the
                                states they thus name will either reply unfavorably or make no reply
                                and that thus the embargo plan may be killed and at the same time
                                responsibility therefor diverted.</p>
                            <p>6. In the circumstances that seem to be developing Secretariat
                                officials feel that the only hope for a successful issue of this
                                matter lies in two or three of the great powers taking the position
                                that they will institute an embargo regardless of the action of any
                                other states and that the moral force of such a position would impel
                                all the other powers to follow such an example. They envisage that
                                it would facilitate the general acceptance of such a position should
                                the pertinent statements of policy include that such action would
                                not be regarded as a precedent but that the Chaco situation should
                                be considered a special case, ample grounds for regarding it as such
                                being in their opinion to be found in the Commission’s report and in
                                the general Chaco situation.</p>

                                    and withholding announcement of Italy’s reply pending

                                    Secretary General of the League in charge of the Political
                                    Section.</note> informs me in confidence that it is felt after
                                giving the matter consideration that Italy cannot be asked to
                                eliminate Japan and Soviet Russia from the states on which it makes
                                its action on the Chaco arms embargo contingent inasmuch as Italy
                                could logically defend her policy on the basis of both being arms
                                producing countries.</p>
                            <p>He stated that a part of the strategy of the arms embargo proposal
                                was however to employ it as pressure to induce Bolivia and Paraguay
                                to accept the League Commission’s report. It has been hoped that the
                                making public of the progressive acceptance by states of the
                                proposal would augment that pressure; thus by the same token the
                                announcement of such a reply as Italy’s introducing the problem of
                                obtaining the presumably difficult acquiescence of Russia and Japan
                                would have <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0318"/>the opposite
                                effect. The Secretariat’s present endeavor is therefore to induce
                                Italy to reword her reply in a manner which while retaining the same
                                purport would not specifically mention Russia and Japan, such a
                                reply to be made public and communications presumably eventually to
                                be furnished Moscow and Tokyo (Consulate’s 98, May 28, noon,
                                paragraph 3) could be withheld for a while. Aloisi is now in
                                telephonic communication with Rome on this subject.</p>
                            <p>This would all seem to me to be difficult of adjustment and I feel
                                that Italy’s intent will soon become common knowledge. In any event
                                Walters requests that the existence and nature of the Italian reply
                                be kept for the present strictly confidential.</p>

                            <p>101. My No. 98, May 28, noon, paragraph 2. The German Consul here has
                                just called on me. He stated that he had received instructions from
                                his Government to inform me that Germany would make no reply to the
                                League’s Chaco arms embargo communication; but that Germany would
                                conform its policy to that of the United States. His understanding
                                was that following the United States taking a definite position
                                respecting an embargo Germany would publicly take the same
                                position.</p>
                            <p>He requested that I inform the responsible League authorities of the
                                substance of our conversation with the request that it be kept
                                strictly confidential.</p>

                                of Russia and Japan and terminates with a statement to the effect

                                        would ship no arms to the belligerents, Paraguay and

                                        Germans, who withdrew from the League last October, asked
                                        the United States, which never has been a member of the

                            <p>117. Department’s 49, May 31, 8 p.m., second paragraph. Walters saw
                                me late last evening and stated that lack of definite instructions
                                in Geneva of the German position on the arms embargo was most
                                harmful and that in view of the United States now having taken a
                                position on which the Germans appear to be contingent he asked me if
                                I could obtain for the League from the German Consul here
                                information as to Germany’s probable action. I replied that as the
                                German Consul has stated it to me German policy in this matter was
                                concerned with Germany’s relations with the United States and that
                                my informing the League of it which I had been glad to undertake was
                                purely collateral. I thus felt that I could not well pursue the
                                matter further with the Germans. United Press and [<hi rend="italic"

                                representatives here had told me that the German Consul had given
                                them the information embodied in my 101, May 29, 11 a.m. Pertinent
                                news accounts now appearing in the American press in Paris render
                                the situation here somewhat confusing.</p>
                            <p>I naturally surmise that Washington has been in direct touch with
                                Berlin on this subject. Could, however, the German position as it
                                was forecast to me be in some manner authoritatively communicated
                                here it would be as I see it distinctly helpful particularly as so
                                many states have made Germany’s action contingent upon theirs.</p>

                                reaction here to the United States position in the matter of the
                                Chaco arms embargo is one of extreme gratification. Current reports
                                of the favorable steps being taken by Congress even prior to the
                                formal declaration of the embargo obviously stimulated action by
                                other states. League officials also from a technical point of view
                                regard the declaration as evidence that in specific cases judged by
                                the United States on their merits the latter is willing to cooperate
                                effectively with the peace machinery of the League. Expressions of
                                satisfaction have been made <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0321"
                                />to me by officials of a large number of delegations even in
                                quarters where it might be suspected that the prompt action of the
                                United States was received with some dismay as eliminating an excuse
                                for delay or for the adoption of a negative attitude.</p>

                                <item>He stated to me that Berlin informed him that its fundamental
                                    position was to “make no difficulties” for the embargo but that
                                    it would reply direct to the League and would probably not act
                                    otherwise on its own initiative. He was given to understand,
                                    however, that if any interested state should address a pertinent
                                    inquiry to Berlin they were prepared to give a favorable

                                <item>League authorities tell me that they are considering asking
                                    Great Britain or some other League state which has included
                                    Germany as a state upon which their action was contingent to
                                    address Berlin in the sense discussed in the preceding
                                    paragraph. Could they at the same time gain Berlin’s assent to
                                    communicate the German reply to the League, Germany’s position
                                    would be formalized.</item>

                                <item>I can only say that the reasons why other states have made
                                    Germany’s action contingent upon theirs is a part of the almost
                                    impenetrable network of political considerations which appears
                                    here to surround this entire matter. On the more technical side
                                    with respect to article 170 of the Versailles Treaty,
                                    Secretariat authorities note that the embargo proposal embraces
                                    the question of transit. The same naturally holds good also for
                                    Austria.</item>

                                Paraguayan representative on leaving for Paris stated that his
                                Government’s statement under paragraph 2 of article 15 would
                                probably not be ready for at least a month. The consideration by the
                                Council of the substance of the dispute will therefore in all
                                probability remain suspended for some time.</p>

                                previous telegrams the plan of action on this question envisages if
                                possible a complete separation from the substance of the dispute.
                                Official League position is therefore that the application of
                                article 15 will have no effect thereon, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)—A
                                Committee of Jurists met this morning to attempt to find a formula

                                precise and identic. This was seen to be of the greatest difficulty
                                in view of the great variety in the terms of the replies and the
                                differences in the laws in force in the various countries.</p>
                            <p>The jurists express themselves strongly that this is not a juridical
                                question but rather a political and practical. The legal adviser is
                                however making a further effort to find a formula to present to the
                                Committee of Jurists on Monday.</p>
                            <p>In this connection the legal adviser informed me that the question
                                has been raised as to the exact scope of the American embargo
                                proclamation and that it would be helpful to him to have the text of
                                the proclamation or at least that portion which designates
                                specifically the types of war material covered and the nature of the
                                prohibition prescribed, that is, sale, transit, export, et

                                            and in the interdependence of the action involved. Note

                                            noted that it has been conducted under a scheme devised
                                            to obviate certain technical difficulties (Consulate’s
                                                85<note n="81" xml:id="d315fn81">May 19, midnight,

                                            was seen at the outset that favorable Council action
                                            would be exceedingly difficult to obtain not only
                                            because of the unanimity rule vis-à-vis the evident
                                            attitude of Bolivia and Paraguay but more fundamentally
                                            because it was undoubtedly known to Council leaders that
                                            the position taken by important Council states in
                                            response to 1933 embargo proposals would be maintained
                                            in respect of the present proposals. The receipt of the
                                            formal replies only confirms this and renders evident
                                            that any Council action which must be predicated on the
                                            common denominator of all the replies received would be
                                            worthless as a practical embargo measure. While
                                            conducted under the aegis of the League and
                                            theoretically under League procedures it was seen that
                                            in essence it was a “matter for individual states”. The
                                            inconsistencies in this situation in my mind militate
                                            against incisive action. The Committee of Three cannot
                                            divest itself of the fact that it is a Council
                                            Committee. Although close questions are involved a good
                                            case can be made that the embargo proposal itself and
                                            action envisaged thereunder do not harmonize with or are
                                            perhaps even subversive of various provisions of the
                                            Covenant. Note Bolivia’s repeatedly expressed position
                                            in this respect which I have reported and the attitude
                                            Czechoslovakia (Consulate’s 85) and doubtless of other
                                            League states, an open statement of which would
                                            undoubtedly be made were the matter forced to an issue
                                            in a League body. Again in objections of this character
                                            it is extremely difficult to determine the underlying
                                            motives.</item>

                                    preoccupations are current to the effect that unless some
                                    satisfactory advance can shortly be made here to disembarrass
                                    the League of this problem and to arrange if possible for some
                                    important League state to take the matter in hand and to conduct
                                    the affair under an enhanced freedom of action, the point of
                                    departure for such action on the part of such a state might be
                                    made to rest primarily on practical and humanitarian
                                    considerations.</item>

                                    convene here a meeting of Council states but technically not
                                    meeting as the Council, to inquire what embargo measures each
                                    had taken or was prepared to take. Although no satisfactory
                                    common formula could be evolved from the replies received a
                                    request would be made at such a meeting that each institute
                                    immediately an embargo in some form. It is understood here that
                                    the states which have thus far executed embargo measures are the
                                    United States, Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland, Brazil and
                                    Argentina. The Italians, however, stated that they were

                            <p>54. Your No. 129, June 2, 6 p.m. The full text of the President’s
                                Proclamation has been sent to Berne for transmission to the
                                Secretary General. The essential portion reads as follows: “…It
                                shall be unlawful to sell …. any arms or munitions of war in any
                                place in the United States to the countries now engaged in that
                                armed conflict, or to any person, company or association acting in
                                the interest of either country …”</p>
                            <p>The phrase “arms or munitions of war” is not defined. The definition
                                would be a matter for determination by the courts in decisions in
                                cases arising under the Proclamation. In this connection, the
                                following opinion of Attorney General Wickersham of March 25, 1912,
                                is of interest: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“In my opinion the phrase ‘arms and munitions of war’, as

                                        proclamation should be interpreted as referring to those

                                practical importance if embargoes are established by other producing
                                countries. Export was not prohibited in order that there might be no

                            <p>142. 1. Chaco question substance of the dispute. At a meeting of the
                                Council held yesterday afternoon the President in closing the
                                present session enjoined the two parties to submit their statements
                                under article 15 as soon as possible and suggested that July 1 be
                                considered as the time limit for their submission. He laid emphasis
                                on the circumstance that the procedure of conciliation under article
                                11 remained open and was likewise provided by paragraph 3 of article
                                15. The Committee of Three was instructed to pursue its efforts on
                                that basis and was authorized to ask in its discretion for the
                                convocation of an extraordinary session of the Council. The Bolivian
                                and Paraguayan representatives confined themselves to stating that
                                    <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0328"/>they would immediately
                                inform their Governments of the Council’s proceedings, the
                                Bolivians, however, referring to the arms embargo made complete
                                reservations respecting any action outside article 15.</p>
                            <p>2. As was the case in connection with Bolivia’s possibly accepting
                                the Commission’s report (Consulate’s 89, paragraph 4<note n="85"
                                    xml:id="d321fn85">May 22, 3 p.m., <ref target="#pg_242">p.
                                        242</ref>.</note>), the impression grows that Bolivia if her
                                military position be adverse at the time would accept any report
                                that the Council might make, her tactics in this being if possible
                                to place Paraguay in the position contemplated under paragraph 6 of
                                article No. 15. With this in mind the Council would exercise great
                                care respecting the terms of its report (note Consulate’s 61, April
                                28, 11 a.m., paragraph 3<note n="86" xml:id="d321fn86">Not
                                    printed.</note>). Depending on the military situation Paraguay
                                will undoubtedly delay the submission of its report as long as
                                possible. Another element of delay is the possibility of action
                                under paragraph 15 of the article. In this complex situation
                                developments here are at least not very promising and at most are
                                difficult to forecast.</p>
                            <p>3. Consulate’s 131, paragraph 2(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>).<note

                                the difficulties of the arms embargo question being brought before
                                the Council are increased by Bolivia’s appeal under article 15 in
                                that either disputant could contend that the application of
                                sanctions previous to the action envisaged under paragraph 4 of the
                                article in question would constitute an improper prejudgment of the
                                case particularly as theoretically at least the final determination
                                of the Council under that article might select only one of the
                                disputants as the subject of sanctions. This would be a position
                                probably juridically impossible to contravert and thus would
                                doubtless receive the support of other Council states.</p>
                            <p>4. Arms embargo proposal.</p>

                                    rend="italic">a</hi>). Najera before the Council meeting showed
                                me a draft “undertaking” which after repeated modifications had
                                reduced to a minimum the obligations which the states might take
                                individually in the matter of embargo measures. He told me that
                                Italy not only objected even to so attenuated an undertaking but
                                also to its being brought forward. He interpreted Italy’s objection
                                to its being presented to her desire not to be placed in the
                                position of having her attitude in the matter being made so
                                unequivocally explicit.</p>

                                nevertheless called a meeting of Council states (Consulate’s 135,

                                following telegram. It represents the technical essentials of the
                                development in this matter to date. As to the status of this
                                document or of the document in the final form into which it may
                                evolve I can only say that it must speak for itself. Due to its
                                nature and the indeterminate character of the meeting which is
                                passing upon it its status here is consciously entirely
                                undefined.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The meeting of Council states was private
                                but yesterday evening in giving me the draft undertaking Najera
                                informed me of developments in the meeting substantially as follows.
                                All the Council states (except Panama which was absent) accepted the
                                proposal except Italy and France. Some states declared their
                                readiness to sign immediately. Italy took the technical position
                                that she must wait for the replies from Germany, Japan and Russia.
                                France expressed readiness to accept upon Italy’s acceptance but
                                mentioned that she understood the embargo of the United States
                                omitted reference to airplane and airplane parts including motors.
                                Italy’s general attitude and the question of the Italian reservation
                                in its reply respecting existing contracts, although the latter was
                                not mentioned in the meeting, were the chief obstacles to an
                                agreement. The present program is that the draft undertaking
                                probably after some amendments will be again discussed in a similar
                                meeting this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Najera informed me that he believed that
                                Italy’s position was determined by the existence of Italian
                                contracts with one or both of the belligerents providing for future
                                shipments of munitions over an extended period. He also felt that
                                Italy was governed in the matter by complex political considerations
                                the character of which he could not determine.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I would say that there would seem to be ample
                                evidence that Italy has been playing some special role in the Chaco
                                affair for some time. The obstructive attitude of the Italian member
                                of the Commission seems to be notorious both in the field and in
                                drafting the Commission’s report in Geneva. Note in this connection
                                Consulate’s despatches 613, political, June 6, 1933, page 15, and
                                632, political, July 14, 1933, page 11.<note n="89"
                                    xml:id="d321fn89">Neither printed.</note></p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) In private conversations the Italians here
                                assert that their only objection to the embargo is a skepticism of
                                states applying it honestly. The French declare that their attitude
                                is based upon the circumstances that unless Italy modifies her
                                position an embargo would be useless and merely give Italy all the
                                advantages in munitions sales.</p>
                            <p>My estimate of the situation is that Great Britain is now pressing
                                the matter hard and that France is mildly supporting or at least not
                                objecting. The Italians are uncomfortable under a continuing <pb
                                    n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0330"/>general pressure and
                                modification of Italy’s position appears at least possible.</p>

                                definite knowledge of the developments. I do not anticipate that
                                this will be definitely raised and I am merely informing the

                            <p>145. Emphasizing the inequitable character of an arms embargo against
                                both parties, the Bolivian representative in a communication to the
                                Secretary General declares that Paraguay’s arsenals at Puerto
                                Sajonia and a munitions factory at Campo Grande specifies in detail
                                the war supplies manufactured in Paraguay and states that Bolivia’s
                                dependence on foreign factories places her in an inferior
                                position.</p>

                            <p>146. I have conveyed the information embodied in the first five
                                paragraphs Department’s 54 June 6, 7 p.m. to the legal adviser of
                                the Secretariat. I have thought it inadvisable for reasons analogous
                                to those which I express below to give the impression that I am
                                acting under formal instructions.</p>
                            <p>The material in the final paragraph is extremely useful to me in my
                                responses to informal inquiries which I couch as simply my personal
                                understanding of these matters. I have, however, refrained from
                                employing this information in any way as a concrete or connected
                                statement and in particular from conveying the inference that I am
                                presenting American official views or that I have received pertinent
                                instructions from the Department. I have, moreover, made no mention
                                    <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0332"/>of the statement in the
                                final sentence of the paragraph in question. I have done this to
                                avoid what I feel to be a very real danger of giving Paraguayans or
                                any other representatives here the opportunity of construing what I
                                might say as tantamount to American reservations to a complete
                                embargo or as implying that the United States was making its action
                                in any way contingent on the action of other states.</p>
                            <p>On the supposition that in view of other considerations, the
                                Department desires to have its position in these matters fully
                                clarified here I shall continue in this course unless otherwise
                                instructed.</p>

                            <p>149. Arms embargo proposal.</p>
                            <p>1. Japan has replied orally through its Consul General here. The
                                following is the text of an official memorandum of Yokoyama’s
                                statement to Najera: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“With regard to the telegram which you addressed to our
                                        Minister of Foreign Affairs concerning the question of the
                                        embargo on arms directed at Bolivia and Paraguay, by order
                                        of my Government I hasten to inform you as follows.</p>
                                    <p>Since the withdrawal from the League of Nations the
                                        Government of Japan has adopted the principle of abstaining
                                        from all participation in enterprises of this institution
                                        having a political character.</p>
                                    <p>The Government of Japan regrets in these circumstances that
                                        it cannot depart from this principle in regard to a
                                        political problem such as this embargo proposal having a
                                        relation to the stipulations of article No. 11 and others of
                                        the Covenant of the League of Nations.</p>
                                    <p>It should be noted that Japan having never exported arms
                                        destined to Bolivia or Paraguay it is not appropriate that
                                        it be mentioned at this time in this
                                manner.”</p></quote></p>
                            <p>2. Coincident with Japan’s reply there appeared an obviously inspired
                                item in the Geneva press quoting a statement of the Japanese Foreign
                                Office spokesman to the effect that Japan had adopted the <pb
                                    n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0333"/>principle not to take part
                                in political questions dealt with by the League. The communiqué
                                added that Japan had not yet, however, adopted any practical method
                                for the application of this principle.</p>
                            <p>3. I believe that I am correct in saying that the telegram from
                                Najera was the first communication on a political subject from the
                                League to Japan since the latter’s withdrawal from the Extraordinary
                                Assembly. The Japanese action in this matter is of significance as
                                rendering publicly explicit an important element in Japan’s policy
                                in her general relations with the League which I have discussed in
                                previous communications (note in particular Consulate’s despatch No.
                                765, political, December 20, 1933, page 3<note n="91"
                                    xml:id="d326fn91">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                            <p>4. I have reason to surmise that some League state, probably Great
                                Britain, may endeavor to obtain a more satisfactory answer from
                                Japan (for reasons implied in my telegram to follow) but to avoid a
                                formal unfavorable reply no action will be taken without previously
                                sounding out Tokyo informally and that for this reason this action
                                will not be made generally known.</p>

                                afternoon in which I am reliably informed the following developments
                                took place.</p>
                            <p>1. Italy has maintained fully her previous position now however
                                basing her attitude on the unsatisfactory nature of Japan’s
                                reply.</p>
                            <p>This is universally regarded here as the merest pretext.</p>
                            <p>2. Great Britain raises the question of the propriety of “existing
                                contracts” as a reservation and took the position supported by
                                France that an unlimited reservation of such a purport would nullify
                                any embargo measure asserting that at least such a reservation
                                should include a reasonable time limit during which it should
                                run.</p>
                            <p>3. Italy obviously being the state concerned the Italian
                                representative stated that he would submit these views to his
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>4. The British representative announced that he had just been advised
                                by the British Embassy at Berlin that it had no news as to the
                                German reply.</p>
                            <p>5. The following is the procedure now contemplated for continuing the
                                consultations.</p>
                            <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0334"/>
                            <p>Najera will communicate by letter with all the governments consulted

                                will explain that the text of the undertaking is being submitted as
                                a model which the governments may use in communicating the action
                                taken or contemplated individually by each government, it being
                                fully understood that this formula is only a model and that the
                                communication from each government may take the form which it deems
                                appropriate. Najera will in turn inform the other governments
                                concerning the replies received.</p>
                            <p>In the letter addressed to the states which have accepted
                                unconditionally attention will be drawn to the fact that certain
                                states have already instituted embargo measures and that a large
                                number have declared themselves disposed to act unconditionally. It
                                is hoped in this manner to attain at once an appreciable
                                commencement of the execution of the embargo measures. In the letter
                                to the states which have made their acceptance dependent on that of
                                other states Najera will indicate that he will communicate to all
                                the governments consulted the replies received from each in order
                                that the governments which have stipulated certain conditions’ may
                                judge whether or to what extent these conditions have been
                                fulfilled.</p>
                            <p>6. These communications will probably be despatched on Monday.</p>
                            <p>7. The British Delegation in respect to procedure see this as only a
                                third best which it was necessary to fall back on after failing to
                                obtain either Council action or simultaneous action by Council
                                states. This relatively unsatisfactory method combined with the
                                Italian attitude renders the British frankly pessimistic as to the
                                outcome.</p>

                            <p>152. Consulate’s 149 June 9, 10 a.m. Yokoyama has just called on me
                                to discuss’ Japan’s reply. He stated that he was fully cognizant of
                                the Italian position vis-à-vis the arms embargo and while he felt
                                that “Japan’s reply” might be agreeable to Italy he regretted that
                                it might not give satisfaction to the United States and Great
                                Britain. He stated that the form and substance of Japan’s reply were
                                solely governed by Japan’s relations with the League.</p>
                            <p>He then stated that should the United States or Great Britain care to
                                approach Tokyo direct in this matter he felt that a more
                                satisfactory response might be obtained.</p>

                            <p>261. Chaco dispute. Najera approached me today as did subsequently
                                the British Delegation. Najera explained that in a secret meeting of
                                the Council the question had been raised of the shipment of
                                airplanes and motors by the United States which does not appear to
                                have been covered by the embargo. The British Delegation had
                                explained to Najera that they had received a telegram from London
                                reporting a conversation with the Chief of the Latin American
                                Division in Washington in which the British Ambassador was informed
                                that instructions had been given to our customs authorities to
                                “scrutinize” <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0336"/>shipments of
                                airplanes and motors. Both Najera and the British felt that they
                                would be glad if it were possible for a message to be sent through
                                me which I could deliver to Najera to the effect that instructions
                                have been issued to scrutinize carefully such shipments.</p>

                            <p>262. Department’s 160, June 13, 6 p.m. I appreciate the full
                                information which your telegram gives me.</p>
                            <p>Copies of all telegrams sent and received on this and other
                                miscellaneous subjects are exchanged between the Delegation and
                                Consulate so we are thus always continually informed of each other’s
                                reports as well as instructions. In addition there is oral
                                communication between the Delegation and the Consulate if there is
                                any doubt with regard to the despatch of a particular message to the
                                Department. For example, I read over my 261, June 12, 11 a.m., to
                                Gilbert before telegraphing it to ensure that there was no crossing
                                of wires.</p>
                            <p>After reading the previous correspondence both from and to the
                                Consulate and the Delegation and discussion of the matter with
                                Gilbert I have decided not to transmit any information to Najera at

                                    of that reply might lead to the difficulties I have discussed in

                                    comprehensive definition of our embargo measure would serve a
                                    useful purpose such a definition could be embodied in such a

                                    of the smaller powers each improving measures that they found
                                    possible to take now institute a practical embargo the
                                    self-interest of these powers to bring pressure on the
                                    recalcitrant states together with a possible mobilization of
                                    public and press opinion against so tangible a matter as the
                                    actual shipment of arms on the part of a few states might bring
                                    into line the powers which under present conditions are
                                    reluctant to institute such measures. The obvious annoyance of

                                the way of the putting into effect of the League’s proposal for an
                                embargo on arms and munitions to Bolivia and Paraguay. Please

                                Italian Government and the reasons therefor.</p>

                                authority delegated to him in the Proclamation, the Secretary on
                                June 14 informed the Attorney General that there have been excepted

                                28, in reply to the Committee’s inquiry whether this Government was
                                prepared to participate in an embargo; and to transmit the text of
                                the proclamation to the Secretary General. As regards South America,

                            <p>130. Department’s 42, June 16, 3 p.m. In the course of a conversation
                                with Suvich<note n="97" xml:id="d337fn97">Italian Under Secretary of
                                    State for Foreign Affairs.</note> today I mentioned incidentally
                                the embargo on arms and ammunition shipments from the United States
                                to Bolivia and Paraguay which the President had been authorized to
                                place and with a view to ascertaining the views of the Italian
                                Government on the arms embargo proposal before the League of
                                Nations, asked if the Italian Government had any policy which would
                                make it difficult to place such an embargo.</p>
                            <p>Suvich replied that his Government had no such policy; that it had no
                                desire to oppose such embargoes particularly in the Americas; and
                                that it was not opposed to the general idea of arms under existing
                                treaty. He then volunteered the statement that the Italians had
                                withheld consent to the proposal at Geneva (1st) because they felt
                                at the moment that Paraguay had defeated Bolivia and that to impose
                                the embargo at that time would confirm that defeat and, (2d) that
                                they did not believe that embargoes could be efficacious unless they
                                were universally accepted and applied and they had no assurances
                                that both Japan and Russia would consent. He added that the Italian
                                representative on the Committee at Geneva had on his own initiative
                                injected a novel condition which was intended to support the program
                                of the <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0341"/>League in that it
                                proposed to force acceptance of a League program by placing an
                                embargo on shipments to the state which failed to accept. That, he
                                considered, would confront the recalcitrant state with the
                                alternative of acceptance or facing a certain military defeat.</p>
                            <p>In conversations with officers of the War Ministry the Military
                                Attaché to the Embassy was told that no restrictions had been
                                imposed on the shipment from Italian factories of arms and
                                ammunition to Paraguay and Bolivia; that for purpose of reaching an
                                accord on the matter of this arms embargo [conversations?] were
                                being conducted with other governments (France, England and Japan
                                were specifically mentioned) and that until such an accord could be
                                reached no action was being taken with reference to an embargo. It
                                was also stated that there were no dealings in Italian aircraft or
                                aircraft armament with either Bolivia or Paraguay but there were no
                                assurances that no negotiations were under way or that contracts
                                might not be concluded at a later date.</p>

                                that upon being approached by the Paraguayan Government concerning
                                the issuance of a license for the sale to Paraguay of two <pb

                                order to be fulfilled in view of the fact that the proposed embargo
                                covers the supply of aircraft of all types. The British Government
                                expresses the hope that other governments will make the same reply
                                if approached for the same purpose and suggests that the Committee
                                of Three make a communication in this sense to the governments which
                                have declared their willingness in principle to accede to the

                            <p>413. For the Secretary from Norman Davis. In the course of a
                                conversation yesterday Simon referred to repeated efforts which
                                England had made to induce Italy to take a more constructive
                                attitude as regards the Chaco arms embargo proposal. He was
                                particularly concerned over the Italian insistence that the embargo
                                should not apply to existing and recurrent contracts for the
                                shipment of arms. He asked me to transmit to you a personal message
                                to the effect that it would be most useful if the United States
                                could express to the Italian Government its preoccupation over the
                                delay in the practical application of this proposal.</p>

                            <p>301. Press reports from London state that Lord Stanhope, speaking in
                                the House of Lords on July 12, in regard to the Chaco arms embargo
                                said: “As we understand it, Italy said that not merely current
                                contracts but recurrent contracts should be allowed to proceed,
                                which is a very different matter.”</p>
                            <p>Is it to be inferred that the British Government is allowing arms
                                manufactured under current contracts to proceed?</p>

                                Governments and paid for in whole or in part before the embargo

                                that a communication was made yesterday to the League of Nations
                                signifying that the British Government are now prepared to enforce a
                                complete suspension of arms exports to Bolivia and Paraguay and that
                                they will do this as soon as the original governments concerned <pb

                                embargo into force. Under this action the British will stop
                                immediately all licenses for export of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay
                                whether under contracts existing prior to the date of the embargo or
                                not. According to the Foreign Office the British have delayed in
                                making this communication to the League until they had received
                                assurance from the Italian Government that they likewise would enter
                                the embargo plan. The British Chargé d’Affaires in Washington has
                                been instructed to advise the Department fully of the attitude and
                                intentions of the British Government in this matter.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office hopes that they will be notified within a very few
                                days by the League of Nations of the concurrence of other interested
                                countries notably Belgium and Czechoslovakia. The impression was
                                received however that even if Belgium and Czechoslovakia should
                                refuse to concur the British Government nevertheless will enforce
                                the embargo on its part.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Osborne</hi>: Thank you very much for
                                your letter of July 23, transmitting the text of a communication in
                                regard to the sale of arms and munitions of war to Bolivia and
                                Paraguay, addressed by Sir John Simon to the Secretary General of
                                the League of Nations. We were pleased to learn of the progress made
                                toward effective international cooperation in this matter, as we are
                                convinced that the stoppage of shipments of arms to the belligerents
                                will have results, both moral and material, which will hasten the
                                restoration of peace between them.</p>
                            <p>Since the Joint Resolution of Congress, prohibiting the sale of arms
                                and munitions to the Governments of Bolivia and Paraguay or to
                                persons acting in their interest, was proclaimed by the President on
                                May 28, no shipments of such commodities destined to either country
                                have left the United States, with the exception of some which were
                                contracted for by the Bolivian Government and paid for in whole or
                                in part before May 28 and of which the manufacture was completed or
                                virtually completed on that date. At the request of the Bolivian
                                Government, we have made a careful examination of all outstanding
                                contracts between it and American companies and of contracts between
                                the Lloyd Aereo Boliviano—a commercial airline operated in
                                Bolivia—and an American company, and, on grounds of equity to
                                Bolivia, certain exceptions from the general prohibitions of the
                                Resolution have been granted. All shipments pursuant to the sales
                                which have been excepted will be completed within the next week or
                                ten days and as the Secretary has determined that no further
                                exceptions will be granted, no further shipments of arms or
                                munitions destined to either country <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278"
                                    facs="0348"/>can be made thereafter. The effect of the
                                President’s Proclamation will, therefore, be an absolute and
                                unqualified embargo.</p>

                            <p>82. Department’s 71, June 20, 11 a.m. I have informed the Attorney
                                General that there have been excepted from the prohibitions of the
                                Proclamation certain arms and munitions contracted for with American
                                companies by the Bolivian Government and by the Lloyd Aereo
                                Boliviano and paid for in whole or in part prior to the date of the
                                President’s Proclamation. The arms and munitions so excepted were
                                not entirely ready for delivery on May 28, but the process of
                                manufacture had been nearly completed in all cases. Equitable
                                treatment of the Bolivian Government required that these exceptions
                                be made.</p>

                                        which the manufacture was wholly or virtually completed
                                        before the date of the President’s Proclamation. These
                                        contracts have been carefully studied by my Government and,
                                        on grounds of equity to the Bolivian Government, exceptions
                                        from the general prohibitions of the Resolution have been
                                        made in certain cases. Shipments pursuant to the sales which
                                        have been excepted, including 5 airplanes, will probably be
                                        completed within a week or 10 days. As all outstanding
                                        contracts have been examined and as my Government has
                                        determined to grant no further exceptions, no arms and
                                        munitions will leave the United States for Bolivia or
                                        Paraguay after those referred to have been exported, until
                                        such time as the prohibitions of the Resolution are
                                        rescinded by the President or by Congress.”</p>

                                which it appears is not readily available and must be assembled from
                                more than one source. It was stated informally, however, that a
                                practically complete embargo already exists on the part of the
                                British Government with respect to the licenses issued prior to May

                            <p>463. Embassy’s 449, August 3, 1 p.m. Foreign Office, through informal
                                communication dated August 10, confirms oral information previously
                                given and telegraphed to the Department that no licenses have been
                                issued for exports of arms and ammunition to Bolivia and Paraguay
                                from the United Kingdom since May 9 last.</p>
                            <p>The Foreign Office states further that they did not think it
                                necessary to interfere with the completion of a small number of
                                contracts for the execution of which licenses had been issued
                                previous to May 9; that these contracts have been completed and that
                                the British Government are now in effect enforcing a complete
                                embargo on the supply of all arms to the two belligerents, including
                                aeroplanes and aeroplane motors although they have not yet made a
                                formal announcement to this effect at Geneva.</p>

                                Likewise no concern is felt in regard to Austria, China, Guatemala,
                                and Luxemburg since Austria has stated that internal legislation
                                (presumably in fulfillment of her obligations under the Treaty of
                                St. Germain) prohibits the exportation of arms, and the other three
                                countries in their replies to the communication of May 19 accepted
                                the embargo proposal unconditionally. Nevertheless it is felt that
                                the status of Luxemburg will not be entirely clear until Belgium,
                                which I shall discuss later, has given a definite reply, it being
                                assumed that the attitude of Luxemburg will depend to a large extent
                                on that of Belgium. In passing it may be observed that the
                                Committee’s letter of June 15 was not sent to Germany and Japan
                                inasmuch as it was felt that it would not be possible to obtain any
                                information concerning their position on the matter further than
                                that received from them as a result of the first communication sent
                                out by the Committee of Three on May 19. The positions of Germany
                                and Japan were reported in the Consulate’s telegrams No. 101, May
                                29, 11 a.m., No. 149, June 9, 10 a.m., and No. 157, June 11, 2 p.m.
                                The position of Germany as thus made known does not afford any cause
                                for anxiety, but Secretariat officials have frequently expressed <pb
                                    n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0352"/>concern in regard to Japan
                                who merely stated that it “had never exported arms” to the
                                belligerent countries. It is considered possible here that if the
                                embargo is rendered effective by measures taken by all the other
                                manufacturing states, one or both of the belligerents might succeed
                                in obtaining arms from Japan since that country has given no
                                engagement not to ship arms in the future.</p>
                            <p>Coming now to the governments which have replied to the circular
                                letter of June 15, the Department will have observed from the
                                documents which the Consulate has transmitted regularly under cover
                                of despatch that the replies have varied greatly in form and in
                                degree of precision. With the exception of the neighboring states of
                                Chile and Peru, however, to which I shall refer later, the replies
                                of only three countries are causing the Secretariat any serious
                                concern, namely, Belgium, Norway, and Finland.</p>
                            <p>The position of Belgium is important not only because that country is
                                a large manufacturer of arms but also due to the circumstance that
                                the action of Norway and Finland and the continued favorable action
                                of several other states has been made contingent on that of Belgium.
                                As reported in the Consulate’s telegram No. 216, August 16, 11

                                Committee’s letter of June 15 and the follow-up telegram despatched
                                on July 25 to several states including Belgium, together with this

                                warning that if the other states fail to take appropriate measures

                                the belligerents Italy would consider this as justification for
                                revoking her own embargo measures. I have been given to understand
                                in the strictest confidence that the Italians sent this letter
                                because they alleged that they were aware that Belgium was
                                withholding a definite reply in order to allow time for Belgian
                                manufacturers to fill orders for large shipments of arms. I have
                                likewise been apprised in confidence that the British are now
                                exerting pressure at Brussels, and it is hoped that as a result of
                                this action Belgium will fall into line.</p>
                            <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0353"/>
                            <p>Norway has expressed a willingness to apply an embargo on condition
                                that Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland,
                                and Czechoslovakia do the same. This condition seems to be fulfilled
                                with the exception of Belgium. But in addition Norway reserves the
                                right to make deliveries up until December 1 “under a few
                                outstanding contracts.” The responsibile League officials have no
                                information concerning the extent of these contracts, but I
                                understand that they intend to approach shortly the Norwegian
                                representative here in order to obtain information on this head and
                                to attempt to persuade the Norwegian Government to revoke this
                                reservation.</p>
                            <p>The Finnish Government has made its acceptance contingent on the
                                effective application of an embargo by some 21 governments including
                                Belgium, Norway, Chile, and Peru. Belgium and Norway are the only
                                manufacturing countries designated by Finland which have not
                                accepted the embargo proposal. The matter is further complicated,
                                however, through the inclusion on the list of Chile and Peru whose
                                situation with respect to cooperation in the application of the
                                embargo, so it is understood here, is rendered difficult by the
                                existence of treaties between these countries and Bolivia
                                guaranteeing free transit to the latter. Holsti, the Finnish
                                permanent delegate to the League, is now in Helsingfors. I
                                understand that he has been requested to attempt to persuade his
                                government to remove Chile and Peru from the list. The Secretariat
                                is now waiting some word from him.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the obstacles to the effective application of the
                                embargo which I have already described there has been evident here
                                some apprehension in regard to the possibility of irregular
                                shipments of arms reaching the belligerents even if all the
                                manufacturing countries agree to place an embargo in effect.
                                Although all of the governments may honestly enforce the embargo
                                insofar as concerns direct shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay, it is
                                felt that the possibility is not excluded that shipments despatched
                                ostensibly to private companies in other countries may be diverted
                                to the belligerents. It is difficult to judge at this distance from
                                the region of the conflict, and without special knowledge of local
                                conditions, whether this apprehension has any foundation in reality,
                                but I have heard the opinion expressed that there is a danger of
                                irregular shipments being successfully brought through to Paraguay
                                by way of the water channels connecting that country with the ocean.
                                Bolivia, it is felt, is not as favorably situated geographically for
                                obtaining irregular shipments of arms as Paraguay, but even here the
                                uncertain position of Chile and Peru relative to the embargo does
                                not allow this possibility to be excluded.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the reservation made by Norway in regard to allowing
                                shipments to continue until December 1 (and this may be followed by
                                other similar reservations) constitutes a serious danger for the <pb
                                    n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0354"/>successful outcome of the
                                embargo action because other countries such as Italy, in view of
                                this situation, may decide to revoke the measures which they have
                                already taken, and even if this does not occur, the continued
                                shipment of arms to the belligerents for such a long period of time
                                would greatly diminish the effectiveness of the embargo.</p>

                                    Uncertain Legal Basis of the Embargo.</hi></p>
                            <p>In several of my telegrams to the Department I have discussed certain
                                difficulties from a legal point of view which have tended to
                                militate against any incisive action on the part of the League with
                                respect to obtaining agreement or a concerted policy among the
                                states on the embargo proposal. I refer in particular to telegrams
                                No. 85 of May 19, 12 midnight, and No. 131 of June 4, 10 a.m.,
                                paragraph 26. From the very beginning of the embargo movement
                                Bolivia has protested vehemently against the measure as being
                                inequitable in practice, out of harmony with the spirit of the
                                Covenant, and legally subversive of the provisions of the Covenant
                                relating to the settlement of disputes. Even among non-belligerent
                                states, notably Italy and Czechoslovakia, there was great hesitancy
                                in accepting the proposal which they at first more or less openly
                                opposed on the ground that the embargo was in effect a sanction and
                                that the application of such a sanction against both belligerents
                                contravened the prevalent conception that the value of sanctions as
                                an element of security lies in their special applicability against
                                the belligerent which has been determined to be the aggressor or
                                otherwise primarily responsible for the conflict. The states having
                                such scruples consented to give their assent to the proposal and
                                their agreement to put it into effect only on the understanding that
                                the Chaco dispute, as borne out by the report of the League
                                Commission of Inquiry, was a special case which should not
                                constitute a precedent. Moreover, from a legal point of view the
                                League Council was unable to act directly, under Article XI, on
                                account of the unanimity rule. Wherefore the plan was evolved, which
                                the Bolivians apparently consider as a mere subterfuge to hide what
                                is in effect a direct responsibility of the League, of conducting
                                the consultations under the aegis of the League through the
                                Committee of Three but at the same time laying emphasis on the
                                argument that the action on the embargo was in essence a matter for
                                the individual states, both as to the initiative in formulating the
                                proposal and as to the responsibility for carrying it out. In view
                                of these considerations some of the responsible officials of the
                                Secretariat have felt that from the League’s standpoint the legal
                                basis of the embargo was extremely tenuous and have expressed
                                misgivings in regard to the possible repercussions of this affair on
                                the League and the consequences it may have in relation to the final
                                settlement of the dispute.</p>
                            <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0355"/>
                            <p>Bolivia has repeatedly protested against the embargo itself and
                                against the part played by the League therein. I have been informed
                                confidentially that Bolivia has likewise protested to the British
                                Government individually and that the latter has been embarrassed to
                                find an adequate reply. I understand that the British, who initiated
                                the movement, have attempted to shift the responsibility to the
                                League, or at least to thrust a share of the responsibility on the
                                League, not in so many words perhaps but by implication. The
                                Bolivians have replied that in League quarters they were met with
                                the argument that the embargo action was a concern of the individual
                                states and not a responsibility of the League. The British
                                Government, finding itself in this dilemma, had recourse to the
                                Secretariat for help in finding arguments to meet the Bolivian
                                onslaught. As a result of this appeal, an official of the
                                Secretariat prepared a memorandum, of which a translation made by
                                this office is enclosed,<note n="12" xml:id="d356fn12">Not
                                    printed.</note> in which an attempt is made to reconcile
                                realities with legal scruples. This memorandum, after receiving the
                                tentative approval of the President of the Committee of Three, was
                                forwarded to Paris and London with the injunction that, inasmuch as
                                it had not yet been considered by the full Committee, the document
                                should be used as background only from which arguments might be
                                drawn in meeting the Bolivians but should not be shown to them.
                                Recently the Secretariat has privately requested of the two
                                governments to be informed as to what use they have had occasion to
                                make of the document. The French have replied that having received
                                no protests from Bolivia they have had no occasion to employ it. The
                                British have not yet replied.</p>
                            <p>The Secretariat is now considering the opportuneness of making this
                                document public after first submitting it to the scrutiny of the
                                Legal Section. It is now planned to present the memorandum to the
                                Committee of Three which is expected to meet in the near future,
                                when a decision will be made, in the light of the observations which
                                the British may submit on the subject and of the general situation
                                with respect to the Bolivian position on the matter, whether
                                publicity will be given to the memorandum in its present or in a
                                modified form.</p>
                            <p>This document was handed to me in the strictest confidence with the
                                understanding that it be treated as such and considered for the
                                present as being entirely unofficial. The member of the Secretariat
                                on handing it to me observed that, although it might not be entirely
                                watertight from a legal standpoint, he felt that it was a practical
                                rebuttal of the Bolivian arguments. In any case it seems to me to be
                                of interest both as showing the dilemma in which the League is
                                placed and as an excellent example of legal tight-rope walking.</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">(3) <hi rend="italic">The Effect on the Embargo of
                                    the Invocation by Bolivia of Article XV.</hi></p>
                            <p>From the moment when Bolivia invoked Article XV of the Covenant
                                officials of the Secretariat have maintained that this action would
                                in no wise interfere with the embargo. Up until now this view seems
                                to have been correct and may possibly remain so throughout the
                                League’s treatment of the dispute. There is a feeling, however, at
                                the present moment that matters may so develop that it may be
                                desirable, or even necessary, to attempt to correlate the embargo
                                action with the action of the League on the substance of the dispute
                                under Article XV. It has been suggested that the Assembly’s
                                “recommendations” under paragraph 4 of Article XV might include an
                                injunction to the members of the League to apply an embargo equally
                                to the two belligerents, since in the view of the Chaco Commission
                                as set forth in its report it was impossible to determine the
                                aggressor in this conflict, that both parties were violating the
                                Covenant in continuing the war, that neither had shown any real
                                intention of seeking a peaceful solution, and that both are
                                consequently equally guilty.</p>
                            <p>There are two schools of thought in the Secretariat in regard to this
                                matter, one which considers the foregoing as legally possible and
                                supports it, another which maintains that such a procedure is not
                                legally sound, chiefly, I understand, because they consider the
                                “recommendations” envisaged in this Article as being addressed to
                                the two parties to a conflict and not to the members of the League.
                                In this connection the Department will recall that the
                                recommendations of the Assembly under this Article for the
                                settlement of the Sino-Japanese conflict did in fact include a
                                corollary injunction to the members of the League not to recognize
                                the “Manchukuo” régime.</p>
                            <p>This matter has not developed far enough yet to allow of making any
                                appraisal of possible developments on this head. Probably no
                                decision can be reached until the statements of the two parties have
                                been examined and the feeling of the Assembly on the question as a
                                whole has become manifest. This would seem to be particularly true
                                because the dispute has been under the competence of the Council in
                                the past and affairs may take an entirely new turn when the matter
                                is brought before the Assembly in accordance with the Bolivian
                                request reported in my telegram No. 158, June 11, 4 p.m.<note n="13"

                                    Dispute</hi></p>
                            <p>As intimated above, the action on the substance of the dispute under
                                Article XV is still in abeyance. I have been informed in confidence
                                that the Secretariat is now in possession of the statements of each
                                of the parties required by paragraph 2 of Article XV. Strange to <pb
                                    n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0357"/>say, these statements have
                                not yet been submitted officially to the Secretary-General but were
                                handed in unofficially as advance copies of what is presumably the
                                official versions. As a matter of fact the status of these documents
                                is very nebulous. In the case of Paraguay the representative of that
                                country handed the document over without a covering communication
                                stating that it should not be made public until it was possible to
                                make public simultaneously the Bolivian statement. This would seem
                                to indicate that the text of the Paraguayan statement in the
                                possession of the Secretariat is in fact the official version. As to
                                the Bolivian document, I have been unable to ascertain exactly how
                                it came to the Secretariat but I am informed by a responsible and
                                reliable official that it is there. This official intimated, but did
                                not say so directly, that the Bolivian representative, Costa du
                                Rels, had handed it over as an advance copy. It is therefore not
                                possible at present to ascertain definitely whether the text of the
                                Bolivian statement in the possession of the Secretariat is the final
                                official version. In any case, the Secretariat is now making
                                translations of both documents. They will not be circulated,
                                however, until their transmission to the Secretariat has been
                                rendered official through some action of the governments
                                concerned.</p>
                            <p>I have been informed that a cursory examination of these statements
                                seems to indicate that they add nothing new to the mass of
                                argumentation which the parties have already submitted throughout
                                the long course of this conflict.</p>
                            <p>As to possible action on the substance of the dispute under Article
                                XV, developments are not yet sufficiently advanced to afford the
                                basis for even a summary appraisal. In view of the circumstance that
                                Paraguay has not been as successful in pushing her campaign in the
                                Chaco as she apparently felt that she would be during the first
                                flush of victory, and in view of the strain on both parties, the
                                Secretariat feels, but with little optimism, that possibly there may
                                be some hope that the parties may return to Geneva in a more
                                conciliatory frame of mind.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            <p>247. Council this morning discussed the question of the arms embargo
                                and adopted a report in which it is stated that insofar as the
                                Council is concerned this question now has its natural place in the
                                Sixth Committee of the Assembly to which the dispute has been
                                referred <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0358"/>and that its
                                further discussion by the Council would serve no useful purpose.</p>
                            <p>The French delegate emphasized that the delay by certain states in
                                applying the embargo measures placed his Government in a difficult
                                position and urged these states to take immediate action. The
                                representatives of Czechoslovakia, Great Britain and Spain supported
                                this view.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the question in its larger aspects the French delegate
                                also declared that the dispute must be settled in the shortest
                                possible time and that the League must insist upon the proper
                                execution of any decisions it may take.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the Council’s decision mentioned above while I have no
                                information as to whether or in what manner the arms embargo
                                question may actually be raised in the Sixth Committee it is
                                possible that an attempt may be made at some time to join the
                                embargo with the Assembly’s action on the substance of the dispute
                                along the lines of the suggestion described in my despatch 979,
                                political, August 25, pages 11 and 12.</p>

                            <p>267. Consulate’s 251, September 20, 11 a.m. paragraph 3.<note n="14"
                                    xml:id="d358fn14">Not printed.</note> The First Committee today
                                adopted a report on the legal questions raised by the Italian
                                Delegation. The report considers, first, the legal status of the
                                present embargo against Bolivia and Paraguay and second, the
                                question of principle viewed from the standpoint of pure law and in
                                particular the question of prohibiting under the provisions of the
                                Covenant the supply of arms to belligerents.</p>
                            <p>1. In regard to the first question the Committee gave an opinion in
                                the following sense. The members of the League which have imposed
                                the prohibition could take such measures in this particular case
                                without doing so in application of any article of the Covenant. They
                                acted in the lawful exercise of their sovereignty and without
                                infringing any provision of the Covenant.</p>
                            <p>They were actuated by anxiety to contribute to the general interest
                                towards putting an end to war, an object which is eminently proper
                                for the members of the League to promote. It rests with the Assembly
                                to appreciate whether in the recommendations which it may be led to
                                    <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0359"/>adopt under the
                                provisions of article 15 it would be desirable to insert provisions
                                dealing with the matter.</p>
                            <p>2. As regards the second point the Committee is of the opinion that
                                the question is too complex to be solved in the time at its disposal
                                and suggests that the Sixth Committee might propose that the Council
                                be requested to appoint a special committee to study the
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>3. During the course of the discussion the Italian delegate explained
                                that he had raised the question from the standpoint of pure law;
                                that his Government still considers the present embargo as a special
                                case and has no intention of raising it.</p>

                            <p>On May 18 this Government caused to be introduced in Congress a Joint
                                Resolution to confer upon the President the authority to prohibit
                                the sale of arms and munitions of war to the Governments of Bolivia
                                and Paraguay, or to any person, company or association, acting in
                                the interest of either country, until otherwise ordered by the
                                President or by Congress. This Joint Resolution was passed without a
                                dissenting vote by both Houses of Congress and was approved by the
                                President today. Acting under this Resolution, the President has
                                today issued a Proclamation in accordance with its terms.<note

                            <p>5. Your 34, May 29, 5 p.m. The Department does not consider that the
                                resolution proclaimed by the President on May 28 contravenes Article
                                VI of the Treaty of 1858 or the terms of the Habana Convention. The
                                resolution prohibits the sale of arms and munitions of war in the
                                United States to those countries now engaged in armed conflict in
                                the Chaco. Regarding the retroactive effect of the resolution,
                                neither this Department nor the Executive will rule on the sale of
                                arms or munitions made prior to or subsequent to the date of the
                                resolution. This is a matter for determination of the courts.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: The Government of
                                Bolivia has been informed of the measures taken by the United States
                                Government, under authorization from the Congress, to prohibit the
                                sale of arms and ammunition intended for Bolivia and Paraguay.
                                Without entering into consideration of a doctrinal order concerning
                                the procedure adopted, which might form the subject of an
                                interesting argument, the Bolivian Government considers that the
                                measure adopted is useless to secure the cessation of the Chaco War,
                                for as long as the territorial question itself is not settled by
                                means of arbitration, a real pacification can not be reached.</p>
                            <p>With relation to Bolivia, my Government considers that the decision
                                adopted by the American Government is in violation, in particular,
                                of the Treaty of Friendship, Navigation and Commerce signed <pb
                                    n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0361"/>at La Paz on May 13, 1858,
                                in effect between the two countries, which plainly provides that
                                “(nor) shall any prohibitions be imposed on the importation or
                                exportation of any articles, the produce or manufactures of the
                                Republic of Bolivia or of the United States, which shall not equally
                                extend to all other nations.” This means that while the United
                                States Government permits any nation to supply itself with arms and
                                ammunition within its territory, it can not prohibit Bolivia from
                                doing the same, especially if she enjoys, moreover, the benefits of
                                the most favored nation, in accordance with the same treaty. The
                                measure adopted, applying equally to the two belligerents in the
                                Chaco, is unjust as far as it concerns Bolivia, for Paraguay enjoys
                                the benefits of the international waterway which enables her to
                                receive war matériel directly, while Bolivia, which lacks that
                                advantage, will be the only one to suffer from the rigors of the
                                prohibition. Considering, therefore, that the measure ordered by the
                                American Government thus turns out to be favorable to one of the
                                contenders and unfavorable to the other, and that such could not
                                have been the purpose contemplated in adopting it, the Government of
                                Bolivia trusts that as soon as its injustice has been shown, it will
                                be abolished.</p>
                            <p>If, in addition to the injustice that this measure means for Bolivia,
                                it also proves to be true that the American Government is taking
                                steps with other countries to secure its adoption, it is evident
                                that the danger which it causes to Bolivia will be increased,
                                leaving her unarmed, at the mercy of her adversary.</p>
                            <p>In bringing the preceding considerations to Your Excellency’s
                                knowledge, by express instructions from my Government, I have the
                                honor to repeat to you the assurances of my very high and
                                distinguished esteem.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                                receipt of your note of June 1, 1934, submitting the observations of
                                your Government on the Proclamation issued by the President of the
                                United States on May 28, 1934, pursuant to the Joint Resolution of
                                Congress of the same date, prohibiting the sale of arms and
                                munitions of war in the United States to those countries now engaged
                                in armed conflict in the Chaco.</p>
                            <p>With respect to the opinion expressed by your Government that the
                                Proclamation of the President is in violation of the Treaty of
                                Friendship, Navigation and Commerce signed at La Paz May 13, 1858,
                                between Bolivia and the United States, I invite your attention to
                                the fact <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0362"/>that the
                                Resolution prohibits the sale in the United States of arms and
                                munitions of war to those countries now engaged in armed conflict in
                                the Chaco, whereas the provisions of Article VI of the Treaty of May
                                13, 1858, relate to importation and exportation.</p>
                            <p>I have given the fullest and most careful consideration to your
                                observation that the measures adopted, although they are applied
                                equally to the two nations now at war, are unjust to Bolivia
                                because, so you state, Paraguay “enjoys the benefits of the
                                international waterway”, so that Bolivia, “which lacks that
                                advantage”, will be the only belligerent to suffer from the
                                prohibition to purchase arms and munitions of war in the United
                                States.</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as the sale in the United States of arms and munitions of
                                war is prohibited in identical terms to the Governments of Bolivia
                                and Paraguay and to persons, companies, or associations acting in
                                the interests of either, I am unable to see that the “benefits of
                                the international waterway”, which it is alleged Paraguay enjoys,
                                can constitute an advantage to that nation inasmuch as the
                                prohibition on sales of arms and munitions of war imposed by this
                                Government is equally applicable to Paraguay as well as to Bolivia
                                and consequently no arms or munitions of war sold in the United
                                States can be obtained by Paraguay through the waterway referred to
                                or by any other means of transportation.</p>
                            <p>I desire to take this opportunity of reminding you of the consistent
                                efforts of the Government of the United States during the past years
                                in which these tragic hostilities have continued, to further in
                                every friendly way the peaceful settlement of this controversy. I
                                should like further to remind you that this Government has
                                invariably demonstrated complete impartiality as between the two
                                parties to the controversy and has time and again demonstrated its
                                real and sincere friendship to both the Republics of Bolivia and
                                Paraguay, as well as its devotion to the cause of peace. May I
                                further point out that the action to which you refer has been taken
                                by this Government with the full knowledge that other governments
                                have been contemplating similar action and that parallel action has
                                been proposed in the League of Nations.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States, as you are well aware, has
                                dedicated itself to the policy of the good neighbor. It would be in
                                the highest degree inconsistent with that policy that arms and
                                munitions of war manufactured in the United States should continue
                                to be sold for the purpose of assisting in the destruction of the
                                lives of the citizens of our two sister republics of Bolivia and
                                Paraguay and in prolonging the warfare in the Chaco which has
                                already resulted in such grave prejudice to the well-being and
                                prosperity of those two republics.</p>
                            <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                            <p>The Bolivian Minister and the First Secretary of the Legation, Señor
                                de Lozada, called on the Secretary this morning regarding the
                                embargo on the sale of arms. Mr. Welles and Mr. Hackworth were
                                present.</p>
                            <p>The Minister was disturbed by the conclusion said to have been
                                reached by the United States District Attorney, Mr. Conboy, in New
                                York, that, even though goods had been purchased and paid for by
                                Bolivia, the transaction could not be regarded as a completed sale
                                prior to the President’s Proclamation of May 28, where delivery to
                                the Bolivian Agent had not taken place prior to that date. He
                                produced certain canceled checks showing that the supplies had been
                                paid for either in whole or in part; that in some cases the goods
                                had actually been manufactured and were ready for delivery, while in
                                other cases they were in process of manufacture at the time the
                                Proclamation was issued.</p>
                            <p>It was suggested to the Minister that this Department would recommend
                                to the Department of Justice that, in those cases where the goods
                                had actually been manufactured and paid for, an exception should be
                                made. He then raised the question as to the status of goods which
                                had only been partially manufactured or partially paid for. He
                                mentioned in particular cases in which the manufacturer had, on the
                                basis of orders placed, purchased or contracted for materials, and
                                expressed the view that such contracts should not be interfered
                                with; that if, for example, Bolivia should, because of the
                                establishment of peace or for other reasons, decide that the
                                supplies were not needed, the manufacturers would undoubtedly have a
                                legal right to contend that Bolivia was bound nevertheless to take
                                the goods because of the contracts. He expressed the view that
                                likewise Bolivia should be entitled to require deliveries in such
                                cases.</p>
                            <p>The Minister also pointed out that the embargo was not having the
                                effect intended by the United States, for the reason that it is
                                operating against only one of the belligerents; that Bolivia has
                                been depending upon the purchase of munitions in the United States,
                                whereas Paraguay has been obtaining and can now obtain all needed
                                supplies in Europe; that the European countries have not placed an
                                embargo on the sale of munitions; that Italy in discussing the
                                matter in the League of Nations stated that if an embargo is placed
                                by that country an exception will be made with respect to existing
                                contracts, and that, under the circumstances obtaining, Paraguay
                                could, on the basis of supplies already purchased and contracted
                                for, continue the war for a period <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294"
                                    facs="0364"/>of five years, whereas Bolivia, because of her
                                financial condition and other reasons, could not obtain materials
                                from other sources, and that if the embargo is enforced in line with
                                the views expressed by the District Attorney, the action of the
                                United States will fail in its purpose. He thought that the
                                practical side of the situation should be borne in mind.</p>
                            <p>Finally, the Minister observed that our action in interfering with
                                the contracts will have a very bad effect upon the general
                                commercial relationship between the two countries. He expressed the
                                hope that the position of his Government would be carefully
                                considered.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary explained that he had endeavored in various ways, both
                                at Montevideo and subsequent to that conference, to bring about some
                                concerted action that would restore peace in the Chaco; that it was
                                obvious that expressions of desire for the restoration of peace
                                without some concrete action, such as the prevention of the sale of
                                munitions, were futile; and that the only way by which this
                                Government could show in a concrete manner its genuine desire for
                                the restoration of peace was to prevent the sale of munitions and
                                try to persuade other Governments to do likewise; that while he
                                could well appreciate the views expressed by the Minister, it was of
                                course well recognized that any drastic step looking to the bringing
                                about of conditions of peace must necessarily be displeasing to some
                                of the parties and may seemingly work a hardship, but it having
                                developed that no other method holds out any hope for peace, resort
                                to this measure would appear to be the only alternative. He was
                                mindful of the cordial relations that exist and have existed between
                                the two countries, and was desirous of promoting them in every
                                possible legitimate way and would give most careful consideration to

                            <p>35. This forenoon Foreign Minister requested me to call Department’s
                                attention to Minister Finot’s protest being made that arms ordered
                                before embargo were yesterday held at New York in spite of assurance

                                Minister that the President’s Proclamation May 28 does not of course
                                apply to sales completed before the issuance of the Proclamation,
                                and that there have been excepted from the prohibitions of the
                                Proclamation goods manufactured and ready for delivery prior to May
                                28, 1934, pursuant to valid and binding contracts of sale entered
                                into prior to that date and which had been paid for in whole or in
                                part by the belligerent government. The Bolivian Minister has been
                                officially apprised of the foregoing.</p>

                            <p>27. I have informed the Attorney General that there have been
                                excepted from the prohibitions of the Resolution of Congress certain
                                arms and munitions contracted for with American companies by the
                                Bolivian Government and by the Lloyd Aereo Boliviano and paid for in
                                whole or in part prior to the date of the President’s Proclamation.
                                    <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0366"/>The arms and munitions
                                so excepted were not entirely ready for delivery on May 28, but the
                                process of manufacture had been nearly completed in all cases.
                                Equitable treatment of the Bolivian Government required that these
                                exceptions be made.</p>

                            <p>28. Department’s 27, July 27, 11 a.m. In order to avoid
                                misapprehension you should make clear in any conversations you may
                                have with the President or any other officials of the Government of
                                Paraguay that the total value of the munitions destined for Bolivia
                                which have been excepted under the terms of the Proclamation and
                                which may consequently be shipped is $615,071.38, and that the total
                                value of additional munitions contracted for by the Bolivian
                                Government with American companies to which exception has been
                                refused and which consequently cannot be shipped amounts to
                                $2,065,421.79.</p>
                            <p>Full information in the above sense has been communicated to the
                                Minister of Paraguay today. The latter attributed especial
                                importance to the fact that four Condor planes whose construction
                                was contracted for by Bolivia with the Curtiss Wright Company were
                                not excepted and consequently will not be shipped.</p>
                            <p>Finally, you should give emphasis to the fact that no further
                                exceptions will be made under any circumstances and consequently
                                that no additional shipments of munitions can be made either to
                                Paraguay or to Bolivia.</p>

                                    <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0367"/>in order to allow some
                                war materials to be shipped to Bolivia. The more extreme newspapers
                                refer to the United States and Chile as equally unneutral and ask if
                                the Paraguayan Government is going to continue to maintain friendly
                                relations with them. Standard Oil Company influence is charged with
                                responsibility for the exceptions. A statement published as coming
                                from the Minister for Foreign Affairs says that the decision of the
                                American Government to make exceptions to the arms embargo has
                                caused painful surprise in Paraguay and that such action, in spite
                                of the technical legal reasons for it, appears destined to stimulate
                                a continuation of the war and to favor one of the belligerents.</p>
                            <p>The local press also publishes news despatches from Washington to the
                                effect that new peace proposals are to be made by Brazil and that
                                they probably will have the support of the United States. These
                                despatches state that it is inferred from Secretary of State Hull’s
                                observations that he favors mediation of continental scope instead
                                of by a small group. Ayala also has asked me about this point. I
                                shall be glad to learn any information that the Department can give
                                me with respect to the present state of peace negotiations.</p>

                            <p>29. Your 33, August 1, 10 a.m. and Department’s 27, July 27, 11 a.m.
                                and 28, July 27, 6 p.m. The hostile comment to which you refer and
                                the statement published as coming from the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs appear to be based upon complete misapprehension of the
                                situation. The Joint Resolution and the Proclamation of the
                                President issued in accordance therewith did not impose an embargo
                                as stated in your cable under reference, but solely a prohibition of
                                sales of arms and munitions to Paraguay and Bolivia. The imposition
                                of an embargo would have been contrary to the provisions of our
                                existing commercial treaties with Paraguay and with Bolivia. The
                                arms and munitions of a total value of $615,000 destined for Bolivia
                                and excepted from the prohibitions of the Joint Resolution had been
                                manufactured under contracts entered into in good faith long prior
                                to May 28th, the date of the Proclamation; had been paid for in
                                whole or in part; and in all cases the process of manufacture had
                                been nearly completed. As you have been already advised, these
                                exceptions were made after a protracted and painstaking study of all
                                contracts between the Bolivian Government and American manufacturers
                                and were necessarily made solely on the grounds of equity and fair
                                dealing. Identical action would have been taken if any similar
                                contracts between the Paraguayan <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298"
                                    facs="0368"/>Government and American manufacturers had existed.
                                The attitude of friendly but strict impartiality as between the
                                belligerents consistently maintained by this Government is, the
                                Department trusts, recognized by the Paraguayan Government, and the
                                statement issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to in
                                your cable is a matter of some surprise to this Government.</p>
                            <p>You may, in your discretion, seek the earliest opportunity of
                                discussing these facts as indicated above very frankly with
                                President Ayala and with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. You may
                                point out that the action taken by this Government with regard to
                                prohibiting the sale of arms and munitions to Paraguay and Bolivia
                                was taken of its own initiative and prior to similar action taken by
                                other governments. You may further take the opportunity of stating
                                that information has been received by this Government from various
                                sources that Paraguay has been receiving shipments of arms and
                                munitions from European countries where she had placed contracts
                                prior to the imposition of any arms embargo by those countries,
                                whereas it is our understanding that all recent contracts for
                                armaments had been placed by Bolivia in the United States and that
                                the operation of the prohibitions of the Joint Resolution and the
                                President’s Proclamation has prevented Bolivia from receiving more
                                than approximately one-third of the total value of munitions
                                contracted for in this country. With regard to the continuing
                                references made in the Paraguayan Press to the influence of the
                                Standard Oil Company, the Department has received from the President
                                of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey a copy of a message sent
                                by him to the Secretary of the League of Nations on July 27th, of
                                which a full copy is being sent to you by air mail. This message
                                asserts that none of the Company’s concessions lie within the
                                territory in dispute and that the total actual production during
                                1933 from the Company’s concessions in Bolivia was an average of 307
                                barrels per day, sold locally within Bolivia.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that it would be very helpful if the facts as above
                                set forth were made available to public opinion in Paraguay so that
                                there may be no room for doubt as to the friendly and consistently
                                impartial attitude of this Government as between the two
                                belligerents.</p>

                                Saavedra Lamas to the Governments of Paraguay and Bolivia was
                                supported in Bolivia by the Governments of Brazil and of the United
                                States at the request of the Argentine Foreign Office. It is our
                                confidential understanding that the Bolivian Government accepts the
                                formula in principle provided the Government of Argentina, Brazil,
                                and the United States are joined by Chile, Peru, Colombia, Uruguay,
                                Mexico, and Cuba in presenting the formula officially to the two
                                belligerents. The Argentine <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0369"
                                />Minister for Foreign Affairs is now discussing the points raised
                                in the Bolivian reply with the Paraguayan Government and this
                                Government, together with the Brazilian Government, has agreed to
                                support such representations as Dr. Saavedra Lamas might make to the
                                Paraguayan Government for the purpose of conciliating the Paraguayan
                                and Bolivian points of view with regard to the formula at such time
                                as he might deem appropriate. The Department consequently believes
                                it advisable that you should not discuss the attitude of the United
                                States with regard to mediation until you receive further
                                instructions, which will be sent you upon receipt of further advice
                                from the Argentine Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p>59. In conversation this morning with the Chilean Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, Cruchaga alluded to the increasing tension between Chile and
                            Paraguay brought about by the resentment of Paraguay on account of the
                            recruiting by Bolivia of Chilean laborers as well as retired officers
                            (see Embassy’s despatches 114, May 19th and 141, July 7th<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d372fn1">Neither printed.</note>). He stated that the
                            Paraguayan Minister in Santiago had been transferred to Lima although
                            the date of his departure has not yet been fixed. The Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs has been unable to obtain any assurances that the
                            Paraguayan Minister will be replaced and is extremely worried lest the
                            Paraguayan Legation be left vacant. He stated that in this case his
                            Government might feel compelled to withdraw the Chilean Minister from
                            Asunción. He emphasized that should this situation arise it would be
                            interpreted in many quarters as a rupture of diplomatic relations and
                            increase the tension already existing. He explained that he was
                            endeavoring as a gesture to appease Paraguay to secure legislation which
                            would enable the Government to prevent the practice mentioned in the
                            first sentence. He added that while he realized the question of
                            representations on the part of the Government of the United States to
                            the Government of Paraguay would be extremely delicate and might in fact
                            be inadvisable, nevertheless he hoped that possibly in the interest of
                            peace some high official of the Department might in conversation with
                            the Paraguayan Minister at Washington inform the latter that according
                            to advices received from Santiago the Chilean Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs is very preoccupied with the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador informs me that his Government either has
                            already or will shortly approach the Paraguayan Government discreetly
                            regarding this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>The Embassy is convinced that Chile has fully complied with its
                            neutrality obligations and sincerely desires to avoid any friction with
                            either of the belligerents.</p>

                        <p>55. Your 59, July 9, 6 p.m. You may wish to say to Cruchaga that
                            Assistant Secretary Welles took occasion to mention to the Paraguayan
                            Minister that we have been informed both from Santiago and by the
                            Chilean Minister here of the deep concern with which the Chilean
                            Government views the friction now existing between Chile and Paraguay,
                            and expressed our hope that no break in relations might take place.</p>

                        <p>26. The Department has been advised confidentially upon several occasions
                            recently of the very deep concern felt by the Government of Chile
                            because of the increasing friction in the relations between Chile and
                            Paraguay. The Chilean Government is especially disturbed by reason of
                            the transfer of the Paraguayan Minister from Santiago and by the
                            intimation given that no successor will be appointed to replace him.</p>
                        <p>The Department has discussed the matter informally with the Paraguayan
                            Minister in Washington and has expressed the hope as a close friend of
                            both governments that in a crucial period such as the present, no steps
                            may be taken which would definitely impair the relations between the two
                            governments and that in the interest of harmonious relations and better
                            understanding between all of the American republics, a strong effort be
                            made to find a friendly solution of those questions which have given
                            rise to misunderstanding between Chile and Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>It is desirable that in your next conversation with President Ayala you
                            express to him informally the very earnest hopes of the Government of
                            the United States in the sense above indicated.</p>

                        <p>32. Department’s telegram No. 26, July 20, 2 p.m. The President requested
                            me to see him at his home last evening and I talked with him for about 2
                            hours. An air mail despatch covering the conversation will leave
                            Asunción on July 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d375fn2">Despatch No. 94, July
                                25, not printed.</note> The following paragraphs summarize his
                            observations with respect to the Chilean situation and peace
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I told the President the sense of the Department’s telegram No. 26. He
                            replied unhesitatingly to the effect that there is no reason for any
                            hurry about naming another Minister to Chile since such protests as
                            Paraguay has made as to various unfriendly acts of Chile had gone
                            unheeded. He said that the President of Chile has dictatorial powers and
                            could have prevented the enlistment of Chilean officers in the Bolivian
                            Army. He stated that he was satisfied that war materials are reaching
                            Bolivia through Chile and he added that he knew that a secret pact of a
                            military nature had been made between Chile and Bolivia. He said that 2
                            months ago he had told the Chilean Minister in Paraguay of his belief in
                            or knowledge of such a pact and that when the latter denied it the
                            President requested the Minister to verify the report by inquiry to the
                            Chilean Government. The Chilean Minister wrote a telegram to his
                            Government in the presence of the President. The President informed him
                            that the Chilean Government had not answered the inquiry. The President
                            again repeated his often expressed opposition to any suggestion that the
                            West Coast governments serve as mediators in the Chaco controversy.</p>
                        <p>With respect to mediation the President said that Argentina had commenced
                            a movement for mediation and had invited the United States and Brazil to
                            join with her. The proposal had been submitted to Bolivia and the
                            President of Bolivia would agree only if the possession of a river port
                            were guaranteed in advance. Paraguay will not agree to this stipulation.
                            The President reiterated that he is entirely agreeable to the present
                            Argentine proposal of immediate cessation of hostilities with guarantee
                            of security and a meeting of representatives of the belligerents in
                            Buenos Aires with mediators from the United States, Argentina and Brazil
                            to agree upon the points to be arbitrated. This agreement upon the scope
                            of arbitration is regarded by the President as essential. The President
                            thinks that pride rather than hope of gaining her demands was the cause
                            for the Bolivian objection to the Argentine proposal. He believes that
                            Bolivia must have something <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0373"/>to
                            show to satisfy political opinion at home and to counteract military
                            reverses and stated that perhaps some judicious pressure exerted on
                            Bolivia by the United States would lead to an acceptance of the
                            Argentine proposal. I repeated to the President that my Government as a
                            friend of both Paraguay and Bolivia is sincerely interested in the
                            success of any proposal to bring about peace.</p>

                        <p>65. Chilean-Paraguayan tension has increased to a disquietening extent
                            due to intense resentment of Chile against recent anti-Chilean campaign
                            in Paraguayan press of which the Department is aware. On August 2nd the
                            Chilean Foreign Office made what it termed a friendly remonstrance to
                            Paraguay. The Paraguayan reply was considered by the Chilean Foreign
                            Office so unsatisfactory and, in fact, insulting, that last night a very
                            strong note was telegraphed to the Chilean Legation at Asunción for
                            delivery to the Paraguayan Government. This note, which the Embassy has
                            seen, after rehearsing the situation, states as follows: “Together with
                            presenting to Your Excellency a formal protest against the unacceptable
                            scope of the note which I am acknowledging and not finding therein any
                            trace which would signify a retraction of the unusual opinions and the
                            imprudent offenses referred to, my Government has resolved to recall the
                            undersigned diplomatic representative and leave the Legation in the
                            hands of an officer in charge of the archives”.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office states that the Chilean Embassy at Washington has been
                            fully advised in the premises with instructions to explain the situation
                            to the Department. I have not been able to see the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs as yet but the political adviser at the Foreign Office who
                            usually shares his views expressed a strong suspicion that for motives
                            of which he was not clearly aware the campaign in the Paraguayan press
                            against Chile is, if not inspired, at least countenanced by the
                            Argentine Government.</p>

                        <p>113. This morning the Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me a letter
                            dated today from the Chilean Ambassador here quoting a <pb n="304"
                                xml:id="pg_304" facs="0374"/>message from the Chilean Government
                            informing him that in view of the Paraguayan note of recent date
                            self-respect required that Chilean Government withdraw its Minister from
                            Asunción.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated explicitly that he did not
                            consider this a rupture of diplomatic relations but that the entire
                            personnel of the Legation would leave Asunción and that the Argentine
                            Government had agreed to take over the archives and that meanwhile he
                            would continue his efforts to rectify this misunderstanding between the
                            two countries.</p>

                        <p>66. Embassy’s telegram 65, August 6, 6 p.m. Foreign Office informs me
                            that presentation of its note to Paraguay has been delayed due to the
                            telegraphic garbles but that it will be delivered tonight and that
                            Chilean Minister at Asunción will depart next Sunday. Foreign Office
                            does not consider this will constitute technical rupture of diplomatic
                            relations and holds that the latter will arise only when and if Paraguay
                            withdraws its Minister from Santiago and places its interests in the
                            hands of a third power.</p>
                        <p>Neither the Chilean press nor public is fully aware of the situation as
                            yet and the reaction is consequently mild.</p>

                        <p>34. Department’s telegram No. 26, July 20, 2 p.m., and my telegram No.
                            32, July 24, 11 a.m. The Chilean Minister called on me last evening to
                            discuss the exchange of notes between the Governments [of] Paraguay and
                            Chile. He has received by cable from the Chilean Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs the text of a note which he is instructed to deliver to the
                            Paraguayan Government. This note has not yet been presented due to the
                            errors in the cable text which the Chilean Minister is verifying. He
                            also was instructed to inform me, and the Ministers of Argentina, Brazil
                            and Peru concerning the text of the recent exchange of notes between the
                            Chilean Legation and the Paraguayan Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The
                            Chilean Minister has been acting under direct instructions from Santiago
                            in this matter.</p>
                        <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0375"/>
                        <p>The Paraguayan note which called forth the reply which the Chilean
                            Minister is about to present mentioned Chilean protests concerning the
                            violent campaign against Chile and its governing officials which is
                            being carried on in the Paraguayan press, and gave as sufficient reason
                            the contracting of Chilean officers and laborers by Bolivia and the
                            shipment of war materials to Bolivia through Chilean territory and over
                            Chilean railroads. The Paraguayan note observed that these facts forced
                            the conclusion that such actions were the result of a deliberate policy
                            of the Chilean Government and that they were unneutral acts of
                            partiality toward Bolivia.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean note, which the Minister showed to me last evening, states
                            that the Government of Chile had desired to discuss differences calmly
                            through diplomatic channels; that now it could not accept Paraguayan
                            criticism of the President of Chile and the charge that personal
                            economic interests led the Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs to favor
                            Bolivia; that the tone of the Paraguayan note indicates that the
                            Paraguayan Government accepts as its own, and therefore assumes
                            responsibility for, the violent opinions expressed in the press; and
                            that in view of these circumstances the Chilean Government has decided
                            to instruct its Minister to leave Asunción and to turn over the archives
                            of the Legation to an official for safe-keeping. Press reports state
                            that a secretary from the Chilean Embassy in Buenos Aires is en route to
                            Asunción. The Minister said last night that he had no confirmation of
                            this fact but that the Argentine Minister has agreed to take charge of
                            the archives until other arrangements could be made. The Chilean
                            Minister expects to leave Asunción on Sunday.</p>
                        <p>President Ayala has been ill and I have not been able to see him since
                            the conversation reported in my despatch 94 of July 25th.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d379fn3">Not printed.</note> The Chilean Minister suggested
                            last evening, personally and unofficially, that I might think it
                            advisable to see the President to discuss this matter with him. I
                            replied that I preferred not to take any action without instructions
                            from my Government. However, the feeling against Chile is so bitter and
                            the President was obviously so indignant about the matter during our
                            last conversation that I believe that any further reference to it would
                            be unfortunate. This feeling is increased in Government circles by
                            personal dislike for the present Chilean Minister. Consequently I shall
                            take no action in absence of instructions other than to keep informed
                            concerning the course of events.</p>
                        <p>I have just been informed that the note has been presented and that the
                            Chilean Minister is leaving Sunday.</p>

                        <p>30. This Government views with great concern the withdrawal of the
                            Chilean Minister from Asunción and the possibility that a complete
                            rupture of diplomatic relations between Paraguay and Chile may result
                            therefrom. A break in relations between two of the American Republics
                            would at any time be a matter of apprehension to this Government, but it
                            would be peculiarly so at this time in view of the fact that such a
                            rupture of relations might seriously prejudice the successful outcome of
                            the existing negotiations for the pacific solution of the Chaco
                                dispute.<note n="4" xml:id="d380fn4">See <ref target="#pg_32">pp.

                            Government of the United States in attempting to find a solution of the
                            present controversy between Paraguay and Chile which might be equally
                            acceptable to both Governments. You should, of course, be careful to
                            state that this Government has no opinion to express regarding the
                            merits of the existing controversy.</p>

                            the Government of Paraguay so desire, the Government of the United
                            States will be glad to act jointly with the Government of Brazil in the
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>60. Your 66, August 7, 8 p.m. This Government is gravely concerned by the
                            dangers inherent in the withdrawal of the Chilean Minister from
                            Asunción, although it does not construe the action taken as implying a
                            desire on the part of the Chilean Government to break diplomatic
                            relations between Chile and Paraguay. The situation which has already
                            developed and the possibility that this may lead to a complete severance
                            of diplomatic relations appear seriously to jeopardize the possibility
                            of a successful outcome of the existing negotiations for a pacific
                            solution of the Chaco controversy. Moreover, <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307"
                                facs="0377"/>any open break in relations between two of the American
                            Republics is necessarily a cause for apprehension to all of the other
                            Republics of the Continent.</p>
                        <p>In view of these facts, please obtain, immediately, an interview with the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs and state to him confidentially the feeling
                            of sincere regret with which this Government would view a continuation
                            of the ill feeling between Chile and Paraguay and state that the
                            Government of the United States would consider it a privilege if the
                            Government of Chile desired to avail itself of its friendly services in
                            attempting to find a solution of the difficulty which has arisen between
                            Chile and Paraguay which might be equally acceptable to both. You may
                            remind Dr. Cruchaga of the pleasure with which the Department of State
                            acceded to his suggestion that the Government of the United States
                            express its concern, some time ago, to Paraguay at the increase in
                            tension between Chile and Paraguay and state that we would now be happy
                            if we could be of service in bringing about a restoration of normal and
                            friendly relations between the two countries. You should be particularly
                            careful to make it clear that this Government has no opinion to offer as
                            to the merits of the present controversy.</p>
                        <p>This Government is advised by the Government of Brazil that it is
                            addressing an identical inquiry to the Chilean Government, and the
                            Government of the United States would, of course, be glad to act jointly
                            with the Government of Brazil should the Chilean Government so
                            desire.</p>
                        <p>Please cable the reply made to the above inquiry at the earliest possible

                            to President Ayala the American Government’s tender of its friendly
                            offices in the matter of the Paraguayan difficulty with Chile. The
                            Brazilian Minister on his own motion accompanied me. His instructions
                            were identical with my own. The President expressed his appreciation of
                            the interest of the American and Brazilian Governments. He said, and
                            repeated in reply to a direct question, that the withdrawal of the
                            Ministers by both the Paraguayan and Chilean Governments did not in his
                            opinion constitute a severance of relations. As to tenders of good
                            offices he said that there was <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0378"
                            />nothing requiring mediation between the two Governments. I asked
                            whether Paraguay would expect explanations or assurances for the future
                            as to the points of irritation before diplomatic representatives would
                            again be named for Santiago and Asunción and he replied that this might
                            not be necessary. The President expressed annoyance that the first
                            knowledge of the Chilean note informing the Paraguayan Government that
                            the Chilean Minister was to be withdrawn had reached him in a message
                            from the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs tendering good offices
                            before the Paraguayan Government had received the Chilean note.</p>
                        <p>It is my personal opinion that this matter is not serious except as it
                            possibly may affect pending peace negotiations. It would appear to be on
                            both sides a case of gesturing for local effect.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs issued a long statement last evening
                            reviewing the incidents in relations between Chile and Paraguay and
                            concluding as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of Chile has resolved to retire its Legation

                                <p>Consequently, the Paraguayan Government issues the present

                                            Chilean Government.</item>

                                            less with attacks of a personal character directed
                                            against Chilean personalities which attacks merit the
                                            Government’s frank reprobation.”</item>

                        <p>79. On August 7, the Department was advised by the Argentine Ambassador
                            here of the grave anxiety with which Dr. Saavedra Lamas viewed the
                            threatened rupture of relations between Chile and Paraguay and received
                            the suggestion from him that this Government exert its friendly efforts
                            to prevent such rupture. It was also informed that Dr. Saavedra Lamas
                            was himself making every effort to obtain a solution of the incident
                            satisfactory to both Governments.</p>
                        <p>Please advise Dr. Saavedra Lamas at the earliest opportunity that <pb
                                n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0379"/>on August 8, this Government
                            instructed the American Ambassador in Santiago and the American Minister
                            in Asunción to inquire whether the friendly services of the Government
                            of the United States would be acceptable to both Governments with a view
                            to finding a satisfactory solution of the difiiculty. This Government
                            was advised by Brazil that it was taking similar action and in the
                            instruction sent to the American representatives in Santiago and
                            Asunción they were informed that this Government would be very glad to
                            act jointly with other American Republics should that procedure seem
                            desirable to Chile and to Paraguay.</p>
                        <p>No response has as yet been received from the Government of Paraguay. The
                            Government of Chile has expressed its gratitude for the offer made by
                            this Government and has suggested that the United States, either acting
                            alone or in conjunction with Brazil and Argentina, persuade Paraguay to
                            make a statement substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <list>

                                        Finance, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs;</item>
                                    <item>“(2) Paraguay has complete confidence in the fidelity of
                                        Chile towards its obligations as a neutral.”</item>

                        <p>Dr. Cruchaga has intimated that while the first point can easily be
                            obtained, he realized that Point (2) was more difficult and that if the
                            latter was found to be impracticable, he was open minded to any
                            alternative plan which might be suggested.</p>
                        <p>The Department has learned from the Argentine Ambassador here that at the
                            suggestion of Dr. Saavedra Lamas, the President of Paraguay has
                            instructed his representative in Santiago to convey to the Chilean
                            Government a formal statement covering Point (1). In view of the
                            efficacious efforts of Dr. Saavedra Lamas in this question and in order
                            to avoid any complications which might result from independent action on
                            the part of this Government, the Department would appreciate information
                            from Dr. Saavedra Lamas as to the progress which he may have been able
                            to make covering Point (2) as indicated above, and would likewise be
                            grateful for any suggestions which he might make as to the assistance
                            which this Government might offer in facilitating the return to a normal
                            and friendly relationship between Chile and Paraguay. This Government
                            feels certain that a prompt and satisfactory solution of this incident
                            is essential in order that the Chaco negotiations may not be materially
                            hampered and furthermore that frank and full cooperation between the
                            friendly nations endeavoring to compose the difference between Chile and
                            Paraguay would be highly beneficial.</p>

                        <p>31. Your 35, August 10, 10 a.m. The Department is advised by the
                            Argentine Ambassador here that Dr. Saavedra Lamas believes that he has
                            obtained a conciliatory statement from President Ayala which will be
                            acceptable to the Chilean Government covering Point (1) of the statement
                            issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs quoted in your cable under
                            reference. Dr. Saavedra Lamas is conferring today with the American and
                            Brazilian Ambassadors in Buenos Aires. Until it is advised of the

                        <p>119. Last Saturday I discussed the Department’s telegram No. 79, August
                            10, 3 p.m., with the Minister for Foreign Affairs who told me that he
                            was in communication with the Chilean and Paraguayan Governments
                            regarding a formula, the principal points of which he outlined, to
                            settle their differences, that he was reducing it to final shape and
                            would advise me shortly as to developments. Yesterday the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs handed me a copy of an identic telegram he had sent to
                            the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay and Chile which stated in
                            effect that the Argentine Ministry for Foreign Affairs had invited to
                            come to the Ministry, jointly with the American and Brazilian
                            Ambassadors, the diplomatic representatives of Chile and Paraguay to
                            express to the latter on behalf of their Governments their profound
                            regret at learning of the incident, et cetera; that he (the Argentine
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs) had received the mission to request the
                            Chilean and Paraguayan Ministers for Foreign Affairs to express their
                            agreement to the reestablishment of normal diplomatic relations
                            maintaining their respective ordinary representatives and leaving these
                            representatives to discuss amicably questions relating to neutrality. A
                            translation of the last paragraph of the telegram reads as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Chile’s contribution in the pacific efforts which are being made

                            to the Department is informed by the Argentine Ambassador here of the
                            contents of a cable sent from Buenos Aires at 3 o’clock this afternoon
                            by the Argentine Foreign Office in which the Ambassador is advised that
                            the Government of Paraguay has definitely assured the Argentine
                            Government that the last paragraph of the suggested formula is
                            acceptable to Paraguay provided that the word “Paraguay” is omitted from
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Please advise Dr. Saavedra Lamas immediately that this Government will
                            gladly express to the Government of Chile through the American Embassy
                            in Santiago its urgent hope that the formula proposed by Dr. Saavedra
                            Lamas may be acceptable to it and that the basis of agreement so
                            proposed may bring about an immediate resumption of normal diplomatic
                            relations between Chile and Paraguay. Please extend to Dr. Saavedra
                            Lamas my warm felicitations upon his earnest endeavors to bring about a
                            satisfactory and prompt termination of this diplomatic incident and

                            entirely successful as well as the hope that as soon as this incident is

                            solution of the Chaco dispute based upon the Argentine conciliation

                            Government of Chile under the wise direction of Dr. Cruchaga in the

                            and friendly diplomatic relations between Chile and Paraguay would be an
                            essential factor in promoting a rapid settlement of the Chaco
                            controversy, and this Government is consequently all the more anxious
                            that the incident which has arisen between Chile and Paraguay may be
                            adjusted upon the basis suggested by Dr. Saavedra Lamas with the support
                            of the Governments of Brazil and of the United States.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_314" facs="0384"/>to accredit the Chilean Secretary now
                            at Asunción as Chargé d’Affaires providing Paraguay will make reply to
                            the Chilean note more or less as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        the statement contained in the communique of August 9th,

                                        negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the Chaco
                                        question. The Paraguayan Government has seen with pleasure
                                        the efforts which Chile has dedicated jointly with the other
                                        governments towards this noble end and reserving the right
                                        to discuss the questions relative to neutrality by means of
                                        the normal channels as has been the case up to the present,
                                        would be pleased to see the general efforts bring about the
                                        peaceful result desired by general American
                                        sentiment.”</item>

                        <p>The Department understands that Dr. Saavedra Lamas has been advised of
                            this Chilean suggestion. You may take the opportunity of advising Dr.
                            Saavedra Lamas that this Government has been informed of the proposal
                            and that it trusts that the procedure so indicated may be supported by
                            Dr. Saavedra Lamas as a means of re-establishing promptly normal
                            diplomatic relations between Chile and Paraguay. Please state further
                            that in the same manner in which this Government was glad to accede to
                            Dr. Saavedra Lamas’ earlier request that it support his efforts to solve
                            the diplomatic incident between the two countries, it will now be glad
                            to cooperate for the same purpose.</p>

                        <p>38. The Brazilian Minister called on me this morning to discuss
                            instructions that he has received from his Government in the following
                            sense: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Through the Brazilian Embassy in Santiago the Brazilian
                                    Government understands that the Chilean Government is well
                                    disposed toward settling the incident with Paraguay. In view of
                                    the change in the Foreign Minister in Paraguay and because of
                                    the importance to future mediation in the Chaco dispute the
                                    Brazilian Minister at Asunción is requested to approach the
                                    Paraguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs, if the American
                                    Minister agrees, and to confidentially seek to facilitate the
                                    mediation of the Governments of the United <pb n="315"
                                        xml:id="pg_315" facs="0385"/>States, Argentina and Brazil to
                                    reestablish friendly relations between Chile and Paraguay. The
                                    Brazilian Minister is informed further that Cruchaga is disposed
                                    to immediately accredit a Chargé d’Affaires in Asunción in case
                                    Paraguay, at the request of the three mediators, gives a
                                    satisfactory reply to the Chilean note. It is suggested that the
                                    Paraguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs could in such note make
                                    reference to the observation contained in the statement of
                                    August 9th that the Paraguayan Government does not associate
                                    itself with the press campaign against Chile. It is also
                                    suggested that the Paraguayan note could refer to the fact that
                                    in the conversations in Buenos Aires between the representatives
                                    of Brazil, Argentina and the United States these representatives
                                    have [stated?] that they hope to count on Chilean collaboration
                                    in peace negotiations. It is suggested that the Paraguayan note
                                    might state that Paraguay has seen with satisfaction the efforts
                                    of Chile, together with other countries, to bring about an end
                                    of the war, but that the note could reserve the right for
                                    Paraguay to discuss the question of neutrality through normal
                                    channels. Finally it is suggested that the Paraguayan note might
                                    observe that Paraguay as always sees with satisfaction the
                                    general efforts toward peace which is the sentiment of the
                                    American countries.”</p>

                        <p>I do not believe that anything further can be accomplished by approaching
                            the Paraguayan Government again on this matter at the present time and I
                            believe that it would be ill-advised to suggest any such note as
                            outlined above. It is wholly unlikely that the Paraguayan Government
                            would accede to any such request unless circumstances change very
                            radically. The Brazilian [Minister?] agrees with this opinion
                            entirely.</p>
                        <p>I have taken no action whatever aside from discussing the situation
                            informally with those of my colleagues who have come to talk with me
                            about it. The Brazilian [Minister?] has decided not to see the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs but has asked his Government for further
                            instructions. Please cable instructions as to my future action.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully suggest that it would materially assist me here and save
                            embarrassment in my relations with other Legations and with the
                            Paraguayan Government if I were promptly advised of developments in the
                            Chilean matter and with respect to the Chaco peace conversations now in
                            progress in Buenos Aires.</p>

                        <p>33. Your 38, August 24, noon. At this stage in the Chaco negotiations, it
                            has been considered advisable by Argentina, Brazil, and the United
                            States to entrust temporarily to the former the making of such <pb
                                n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0386"/>representations to Paraguay as
                            are considered desirable by the three nations, leaving to Brazil and to
                            the United States the making of such representations to Bolivia as are
                            considered necessary. This procedure has been temporarily adopted owing
                            to various misunderstandings and complications which have ensued as the
                            result of conversations held simultaneously in Buenos Aires with the
                            diplomatic representatives of both Bolivia and Paraguay. For this
                            reason, likewise, it has been deemed desirable to leave to Dr. Saavedra
                            Lamas the task of exerting such pressure upon Paraguay as he deems
                            desirable in order to obtain a solution of the Chilean-Paraguayan
                            incident. The Department has instructed the American Ambassador in
                            Buenos Aires to express to Dr. Saavedra Lamas the hope that Paraguay
                            would be favorably disposed towards the last solution suggested by the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile as reported to you by your
                            Brazilian colleague, but has no intention of instructing you to make
                            representations in that sense directly to the Paraguayan Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department is further advised today by the American Ambassador in Rio
                            de Janeiro that the Brazilian Foreign Office has been informed by the
                            Brazilian Minister in Asunción that the latter is in accord with your
                            view that it is inadvisable to press in Asunción for a solution of the
                            Chilean-Paraguayan incident.</p>
                        <p>As you are presumably informed by the Paraguayan Government, the latter
                            has officially and in writing accepted without reservations the
                            Argentine conciliation formula.<note n="7" xml:id="d392fn7"><hi

                            endeavoring to persuade Bolivia to take similar action. The Bolivian
                            Government is likewise being urged to state clearly its considered views
                            with regard to the nature of the submission to arbitration should
                            conciliation proceedings prove impracticable.</p>

                        <p>162. By invitation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Brazilian
                            Ambassador and I met the Chilean and Paraguayan diplomatic
                            representatives at the Foreign Office this afternoon. The Chilean
                            Ambassador said that he desired to communicate to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs and to the Brazilian and American representatives the
                            fact that his Government had arrived at a complete understanding with
                            the Paraguayan Government over their recent differences, that normal
                            diplomatic relations would be at once resumed, and further that the
                            Paraguayan representative in the League of Nations would cast his
                            country’s vote for the Chilean representative as a member of the League
                            Council. He concluded by expressing in the name of his Government warm
                            thanks for the sympathetic interest and efforts of the mediating
                            countries. The Paraguayan Minister then spoke to the same effect.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that Rogerio Ibarra, former Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            now in Asunción, will be made Minister to Chile and the present Chilean
                            Chargé d’Affaires in Paraguay will be designated Chargé d’Affaires
                            pending the arrival of a Minister.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that I called this morning upon Dr. Cruchaga and delivered to him the
                            substance of the Department’s telegram No. 69, September 18, 7 p.m.,
                            congratulating him upon the termination of the incident between Chile
                            and Paraguay. Dr. Cruchaga expressed not only in words but in his
                            demeanor a keen appreciation of the Department’s sentiments and seemed
                            greatly pleased at the allusion to his personal efforts toward
                            terminating this incident. He stated that if I saw no objection he would
                            appreciate having this message in writing and I of course assured him
                            that since the incident has now been terminated I would be glad to
                            communicate it to him officially.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cruchaga very naturally considers the satisfactory solution of this
                            incident as a decided feather in his cap. His sentiments are clearly
                            expressed in the enclosed translation of his official statement<note
                                n="11" xml:id="d398fn11">Not printed.</note> which appeared in <hi
                                rend="italic">El Mercurio</hi> of September 19th.</p>
                        <p>I am informed on reliable authority that credit for the good sense shown
                            in settling this incident is directly due to Señor Felix Nieto, the
                            political adviser in the Foreign Office. In fact, Señor Nieto has
                            informed me that a few days ago he called Dr. Cruchaga’s attention to
                            the fact that Chile’s national holiday, September 18th, was approaching
                            and that it would be a happy gesture if the Paraguayan incident could be
                            settled before that date. He informed Dr. Cruchaga that in his opinion
                            the Paraguayan Minister in Buenos Aires, Señor Rivarola, was a man of
                            great ability and adroitness and very friendly to Chile. He suggested
                            that Dr. Cruchaga telephone Señor Rivarola personally and suggest that
                            the two countries arrange to resume diplomatic relations without any
                            further splitting of hairs over the fine points of the dispute.</p>
                        <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0390"/>
                        <p>At present a spirit of jubilation is evident in Foreign Office circles at
                            the fact that through their own efforts the incident with Paraguay has
                            been settled and also because of the election of the Chilean delegate to
                            a seat on the Council of the League of Nations. A very natural personal
                            equation enters into the sentiment of jubilation in the sense that the
                            Foreign Office feels that Dr. Cruchaga has scored a diplomatic victory
                            over his friendly rival, Dr. Saavedra Lamas. As the Department is of
                            course aware, this rivalry between the two men, each of whom is seeking
                            the highly commendable reputation of being the greatest Latin American
                            peacemaker, is an important element to be taken into consideration in
                            evaluating the political situation in Latin America generally and the
                            diplomatic relations between Chile and Argentina in particular.</p>
                        <p>The press announced this morning that Señor Gallardo Nieto, formerly the
                            Chilean Minister in Asunción who returned to Santiago some time ago
                            following the break of relations between the two countries, will very
                            probably be reappointed to his former post at Asunción.</p>

                            negotiations due to complete lack of progress. For several months
                            meetings have been purely <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> in order to

                        <p>226. A confidential letter from the Secretariat informs me that alarming
                            reports are current concerning military preparations by both <pb n="322"
                                xml:id="pg_322" facs="0392"/>Colombia and Peru. The letter adds that
                            the Committee of Three set up by the Advisory Committee would be
                            grateful to receive any information as to the state of negotiations now

                            improvement in the relations between the two countries. The Committee of
                            Three has therefore requested the Secretariat to make confidential
                            inquiry of those Governments which are represented in Rio de Janeiro,
                            Lima and Bogotá as to whether they have any information which they could
                            put at the Committee’s disposal both now and during the next few

                            Government’s last information regarding the Leticia negotiations at Rio
                            de Janeiro is that there has been a lack of progress; and that for over
                            a month there have been no meetings due partly, it is said, to
                            dissension in the Peruvian delegation and partly to the absence of the
                            Brazilian Foreign Minister at Montevideo who had lent his encouraging
                            support to the meetings. It is believed that although he has resigned
                            from the cabinet he will continue his conciliatory role in the
                            negotiations. Our information is that Alberto Ulloa and Colonel Llona of
                            the Peruvian delegation have returned to Lima.</p>

                        <p>27. Department’s 16, February 14, 3 p.m. Mello Franco informs me no
                            recent developments but that Peruvian and Colombian delegates are to
                            call on him today or tomorrow to discuss a date for the resumption of
                            conversations. So far as can be judged, reason for delay lies in the
                            fact, (1), that there has been a conflict within the Peruvian delegation
                            (see my 16, January 29, 1 p.m.) and, (2), that there was such a definite
                            deadlock as to Leticia itself that it was considered unwise to force the
                            issue. Mello Franco feels that there is a possibility of agreement which
                            will have to be brought about through some rather complicated exchange
                            of territory. He feels that the time has not been entirely lost as
                            feelings have been afforded an opportunity to cool off and the relations
                            between the two delegations, formal at the outset, have become
                            distinctly friendly and personal. His only concern lies in the fear that
                            the press in Peru and Colombia may start a fresh wave of feeling. He is
                            informed that both Governments are purchasing arms and is unofficially
                            urging upon the two delegations that if they hope to maintain the
                            ascendency of the civil authorities over the military they must come to
                            a [prompt?] and reasonable agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mello Franco promises to keep me informed as to developments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            members of the Commission of the League of Nations for the
                            Administration of the Territory of Leticia expect to turn that territory
                            over to the Colombian authorities at the expiration of their year’s
                            mandate. Some question arose as to whether the date should be June 19,
                            1934, the anniversary of the first <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324"
                                facs="0394"/>formal meeting of the Commission, or June 23, the
                            anniversary of their actually taking over the administration. The League
                            of Nations has been consulted and has given an opinion that the first
                            date mentioned should govern.</p>
                        <p>All of the members of the Commission are of the opinion that immediately
                            after Colombia has again assumed administration of Leticia an attack by
                            Peruvian forces, either regular or irregular, is inevitable. During the
                            recent trip of Mr. Dawson of the Legation staff to Leticia, General
                            Arthur W. Brown, retiring member of the Commission, and Captain Alfredo
                            de Lemos Basto and Captain Francisco Iglesias, the continuing members
                            thereof, gave it as their belief that, in the absence of an agreement at
                            Rio de Janeiro, the possibility of which seems at the present rather
                            remote, the only way to avoid a resumption of hostilities between Peru
                            and Colombia would be for the term of the Commission to be extended.
                            General Edwin B. Winans, replacing General Brown, expressed no opinion,
                            as he arrived at Leticia with Mr. Dawson and had not had time to judge
                            the situation. All of the old Commissioners feel that neither the
                            Commission nor the League of Nations itself could suggest an extension
                            of the mandate and that any action toward that end would have to be
                            taken by the two governments concerned at the Rio de Janeiro conference
                            or otherwise. Both Captain de Lemos Basto and Captain Iglesias stated
                            that they would be unwilling to remain at Leticia more than the original
                            year agreed upon and that if the term of the Commission were extended
                            its personnel would have to be changed. General Winans also remarked
                            that he had agreed to remain only until June and wished to return to the
                            United States then.</p>

                        <p>42. Department’s 24, March 13, 3 p.m. Mello Franco states there is
                            nothing concrete to report. He feels that much has been done to improve
                            friendly spirit of the negotiations. He does not consider it wise to
                            rush matters but in spite of difficulties he is still optimistic of
                            settlement before League mandate expires. He is not clear whether this
                            is May 25th or June 25th. If settlement is not reached before expiration
                            he believes Peru will ask for an extension. There are some doubts about
                            Colombia’s attitude but he believes it can be arranged that Colombia
                            join in request for extension.</p>

                                constituted at Tefe. As to question 2 they agree with the
                                Commission’s recommendation that the territory should be handed over
                                to such authorities as the Government of Colombia may appoint. As to
                                question 3 the League officials recognize that this is a more
                                involved question than the others and while they have not hesitated
                                to express their views on the first two questions to the
                                representatives of Colombia and Peru, they have refrained from
                                comment on the third. However, it is their private opinion that
                                inasmuch as the Commission is exercising its authority “in the name
                                of the Colombian Government” it would be unreasonable to refuse the
                                Colombian Government the right to send such forces to the territory
                                as it may deem necessary at the time of transfer and further, that
                                the Commission must permit the sending of such troops a reasonable
                                time in advance of the transfer of the territory. The letter of the
                                Commission points out that the sending of such forces may be
                                provocative and disturb the tranquility which the Commission has so
                                far maintained. Also they point out that even one thousand men would
                                be helpless before an attack of regular Peruvian forces inasmuch as
                                communication with Colombia could be so readily cut. The Colombian
                                representatives argue, and the Commission admits, however, that a
                                thousand men would be adequate to prevent a sudden seizure by
                                locally recruited forces.</item>

                            <item>The letter of January 23d lays these questions before the
                                Secretary General for confidential communication to states
                                represented on the Advisory Committee. The Secretary General has
                                sent a copy to Colombia and Peru inviting comment. On receipt of
                                their replies the Secretary General contemplates requesting the
                                Committee of Three to study this matter at once. The question of
                                whether or not to summon the Advisory Committee is being left open
                                meanwhile. The officials of the Secretariat are inclined to believe
                                that a useful purpose would be served by summoning eventually a
                                meeting of the Advisory Committee for the purpose of urging
                                moderation upon the two Governments. On this question and on those
                                raised by the Commission they would be very grateful for our
                                confidential advice. It has been my experience that the small
                                committees have usually come to us for confidential advice and any
                                views which we might express would be given due weight and would, I
                                believe, be appreciated.</item>

                            <item>The Secretariat has no very definite information as to the course
                                of negotiations at Rio’. Negotiations were resumed on February 22d
                                but no news has come of progress made. As you are doubtless aware
                                there is some endeavor at Rio to make a trade of the Leticia
                                Trapezium for a strip along the Putumayo, perhaps endeavoring at the
                                same time to give some satisfaction to Ecuador’s claim in this
                                territory.</item>

                            <item>There is apparently a current of opinion in the British Foreign
                                Office to the view that it might be advisable to prolong the life of
                                the Leticia Commission but I am informed by the Secretariat that
                                while at the moment Peru might be disposed to accept such
                                prolongation, the Colombians are definitely opposed to it. It
                                appears to me that the only grounds on which prolongation could be
                                urged would be to provide a period within which some definite
                                proposed solution might be examined and that a mere prolongation
                                always providing that Colombia accepting it would be no more than a
                                palliative.</item>

                            <item>Colombia, I am informed at the Secretariat, has recently purchased
                                from the Portuguese Navy two destroyers mounting 4.7 guns for the
                                purpose of sending them to the Leticia area. I am informed also that
                                the Colombian officials talk freely of the prospects of trouble when
                                the Commission moves out. Apparently in the whole area from Iquitos
                                to Manaos trouble is confidently expected.</item>

                                two questions in your telegram 134. I can only add that the

                        <p>44. Department’s 24, March 13, 3 p.m. Nabuco, Secretary General of the
                            Foreign Office expresses some hope of settlement before the expiration
                            of League mandate but is less optimistic than Mello Franco. He said that
                            there was a move for an extension of mandate for 6 months but doubted
                            whether Colombia would accept.</p>

                        <p>135. Your 230, March 14, 6 p.m., has been most helpful. For your strictly
                            confidential information Gibson cables that Mello Franco states that
                            while there is nothing concrete to report, he feels that much has been
                            done to improve friendly spirit of negotiations; Mello Franco does not
                            consider it wise to rush matters, but despite difficulties is still
                            optimistic of settlement before League mandate expires; if settlement is
                            not reached before expiration he believes Peru will ask for extension
                            and that while there are some doubts about Colombia’s attitude he
                            believes it can be arranged that Colombia join in request for extension.
                            The Brazilian Foreign Office, however, while having some hope of a
                            settlement before expiration of League mandate, is less optimistic than
                            Mello Franco and doubts whether Colombia would accept extension.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraphs 3 and 7 of your telegram under
                            acknowledgment, you may say that we greatly appreciate the suggestion
                            for an expression of our views; that we continue to desire to do
                            everything we appropriately can to assist towards a peaceful settlement;
                            and that for the moment at least we do not feel sufficiently informed of
                            all developments and details of this matter to venture an expression of
                            views.</p>

                            <item>With regard to the question of a prolongation of the Commission’s
                                mandate the Secretariat seems not only to be opposed on general
                                principles but fears that if proposed by Peru it would probably be
                                refused by Colombia. This would start another strained situation.

                            yesterday over excessive armament expenditures which Minister of
                            Hacienda declared reached 72 million soles in past 12 months. Minister
                            of Hacienda insists this cannot go on and he, Minister of Fomento, and
                            one other member will endeavor to convince the President that Leticia
                            must be delivered to League for return to Colombia. Status of Leticia
                            question at present is causing much concern and disturbances in exchange
                            as reports spread that developments are adverse to Peru.</p>

                                would be well for me to have them as soon as possible since a good
                                deal of work can be done quietly in anticipation of the
                                meeting.</item>

                        <p>54. My 44, March 15, 10 p.m. Leticia negotiations here have recently
                            taken on a decidedly less favorable aspect owing to recognition of fact
                            that negotiators are unable to agree upon a basis of solution.</p>
                        <p>One evidence of the growing feeling of uneasiness is found in the fact
                            that both delegations have issued general statements, the Colombian
                            yesterday and the Peruvian today.</p>
                        <p>The Colombian statement stresses the view that there is no connection
                            between the period of the League mandate and the negotiations in Rio,
                            that the latter can perfectly well continue after the expiration of
                            mandate.</p>
                        <p>The Peruvian begins with the rather surprising statement that the trouble
                            in Leticia was caused by rebel frontiersmen. The only thought not very
                            clearly expressed in the statement is that it would be unwise to make
                            any change in the status of Leticia for any brief additional time which
                            might be necessary to reach agreement.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office more pessimistic and disposed to feel that negotiations
                            are bound to fail and be followed by outbreak of hostilities. I shall
                            report more fully when I have had an opportunity for checking up
                            information with Mello Franco this evening.</p>

                        <p>32. We are greatly concerned over the situation between Peru and
                            Colombia. As you know, the League Commission’s mandate expires June 23;
                            Colombia has declined to extend the mandate, and both countries are
                            openly making extensive preparations for possible hostilities. From such
                            information as we have received regarding the discussions at Rio de
                            Janeiro it appears that the Colombian and Peruvian delegations have each
                            made proposals which have been refused by the other side. So far as our
                            information goes Mello Franco does not as yet appear to have made any
                            proposal of his own looking to a settlement. Obviously, it is difficult,
                            if not impossible, in the present state of feeling between Peru and
                            Colombia for either Government to accept any proposal put forward by the
                            other. However, if a reasonable proposal were made by Mello Franco, who
                            is so widely known for his high sense of impartiality and justice, it
                            might conceivably meet with the approval of the two Governments, which
                            could satisfy their public opinion by <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333"
                                facs="0403"/>explaining that while they had invariably declined
                            every proposal made by the opposing side, they did not feel that they
                            could afford to disapprove an equitable solution proposed by such an
                            outstanding personality as Mello Franco, representing the fervent desire
                            and appeal of the American countries for a peaceful solution of this
                            difficulty. We of course assume that Mello Franco has had in mind
                            offering a solution of his own but that he has withheld such action
                            until in his judgment an appropriate time had been reached. It would now
                            seem that further postponement of such action seriously risks the
                            possibility of incidents occurring between Peru and Colombia which would
                            render it much more difficult, if not impossible, to obtain their
                            acceptance of any peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>We therefore desire you, provided you perceive no objection, to discuss
                            this situation as set out above confidentially and discreetly with Mello
                            Franco, and to say to him that it would be a matter of deep
                            gratification and relief to your Government to hear that he had proposed
                            on his own initiative to both delegations a fair and just solution
                            giving hope of a peaceful and lasting settlement of this difficult
                            question. In discussing this with Mello Franco you will of course make
                            it abundantly clear to him that the last thing we have in mind is any
                            attempt to interfere with his handling of the situation; and that our
                            views as set out above arise from our anxiety over the situation between
                            the two countries and our desire to be of any assistance we
                            appropriately can to him in his work for a peaceful settlement.</p>

                        <p>33. Wilson cables from Geneva that the League Secretariat is planning to
                            call a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Leticia on <pb n="334"

                            that the Secretariat seems to be ignorant of the course of the
                            negotiations at Rio de Janeiro. Unless you perceive objection, please
                            suggest discreetly to the Brazilian Government the desirability of their
                            acquainting their representative on the Advisory Committee fully as to
                            the course of these negotiations, so that the Committee itself may have
                            the benefit of this information in their discussions.</p>

                                President and Cabinet are ardently for peace and his own continuance
                                in Cabinet is conditioned upon the finding of a pacific settlement.
                                It is the internal situation, he says, which preoccupies the
                                Government which fears that once thoroughly roused the country

                            recently felt a breakdown was inevitable, later developments encourage

                                    Peruvians insisted that Treaty should be scrapped because it is
                                    vitiated by physical impossibility of executing its provisions
                                    relating to the Sucumbios parcel. This difficulty was not
                                    settled by proposal for exchange of territory, Colombian demands
                                    apparently being considered exorbitant.</item>

                                <item>A further blow was dealt negotiations on Tuesday of last week
                                    when the Peruvians, without advising either Mello Franco or the
                                    other member of their intentions, addressed a petition to the
                                    League Secretariat requesting an extension of the League
                                    mandate. This gave great offense to the Colombians and imposed
                                    considerable burden on Mello Franco in averting serious
                                    complications.</item>

                                    followed the suggestion that the entire case might be submitted
                                    to the Permanent Court at The Hague. Colombians were not
                                    favorably inclined and produced an opinion by Dr. Urrutia
                                    designed to show that the Court could not properly deal with
                                    this case. Mello Franco, however, demonstrated to the
                                    satisfaction of the delegates that the Court could properly deal
                                    with the question and, to make the proposal more palatable, he
                                    suggested that the case might be referred to the Court by the
                                    Council of the League merely for the purpose of obtaining an
                                    opinion. It is Mello Franco’s thought that as the Council of the
                                    League does not meet until May and the Court until June his
                                    proposal would at least gain time.</item>

                        <p>Mello Franco said that he felt, in view of the role we might eventually
                            be called upon to play, we were entitled to know everything and that for
                            that reason he was communicating to us in the utmost confidence and not
                            to be repeated to Geneva or elsewhere that Belaunde and Cano, Junior,
                            members of the two delegations, have been working very privately and
                            without the knowledge of the chief delegates on a plan by which Perú
                            would address a communication to Colombia expressing regret for the
                            events of September 1st acknowledging the validity of the Salomon–Lozano
                            Treaty and proposing arbitration. This communication would suggest a
                            practicable plan for policing the Leticia zone under some foreign
                            supervision, possibly a commission presided over by Dr. Mello
                            Franco.</p>

                            Mello Franco this evening and communicated to him substance of your
                            message which he understood clearly and of which he was deeply
                            appreciative.</p>
                        <p>When I arrived Mello Franco was finishing a long conference with the
                            chief Peruvian delegate who came out with him and remarked cheerfully
                            that he had news from Washington. After he had gone Mello Franco said
                            Maúrtua had told him that a telegram from the Peruvian Ambassador in
                            Washington gave him to understand that the Department supported the
                            Peruvian stand in regard to the prolongation of the mandate. Mello
                            Franco did not seem to take this too seriously.</p>
                        <p>Mello Franco was troubled by perplexity as to which way to move and
                            showed clearly that he has no new solution of his own that he can bring
                            forward at this time. He said very confidentially that he felt the
                            solution indicated in the last paragraph of my 56, April 5, 2 p.m. would
                            be a solution and would assure peace. He is obviously perplexed as to
                            how this solution can be suggested as the two junior delegates hardly
                            dare acknowledge to their chiefs that they have talked matters over on
                            their own initiative.</p>
                        <p>Mello Franco raised the question whether as being a perfectly excellent
                            solution, you would feel disposed to have a talk with the Peruvian
                            Ambassador and ask him as of your own motion why the whole matter could
                            not be simplified by Perú taking the initiative in expressing regrets
                            for the incidents of September 1st (which she has maintained were caused
                            by rebellious frontiersmen) and further-more <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"

                            considerably clarified if Perú instead of attacking the validity of the
                            Salomon–Lozano Treaty were in its communication to recognize its legal
                            validity but stress the practical difficulties of its application in
                            view of the requirements that Colombia turn over territory belonging to
                            Ecuador. Such a spontaneous expression on the part of Perú might render
                            it easier for Colombia to accept a direct settlement which might either
                            obviate or facilitate arbitration of the whole difficulty.</p>
                        <p>He particularly stressed the fact that if you decide to broach this idea
                            it should be as one which had occurred to you without reference to any
                            suggestions from Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>I told Mello Franco that I had no idea whether you would be disposed to
                            entertain this idea and left it at that. It seems clear to me that he
                            felt there was greater hope of the matter being entertained
                            sympathetically by both sides if the suggestion should come from you in
                            informal conversation.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad of any views you may care to give me for my guidance in
                            further conversations with Mello Franco.</p>

                                    <p>“The Governments of Perú and Colombia signed an Agreement at
                                        Geneva on May 25, 1933, authorized by the Council of the
                                        League of Nations.</p>
                                    <p>This Agreement was for the purpose of peacefully adjusting
                                        the frontier incidents between the two countries, caused by
                                        a rebellion in Leticia of the frontier population.</p>
                                    <p>It was stipulated that the disturbed zone would be evacuated
                                        and delivered, for one year, to the administration, in the
                                        name of Colombia, of a Commission of the League of
                                        Nations.</p>
                                    <p>It was also provided that immediately thereafter negotiations
                                        would open between the two States, for the settlement in a
                                        just and satisfactory manner, of all the pending problems or
                                        differences, taking account of the legitimate interests of
                                        Peru.</p>
                                    <p>Things are now in this state. The provisionary status of
                                        Leticia has obeyed the convenience of maintaining
                                        tranquillity on the frontier <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339"

                                        Prudence and a sincere desire for peace, counsel no change
                                        for an additional short period of time if found necessary or
                                        useful for an understanding between the two countries.</p>
                                    <p>A quiet frontier affords a great opportunity for an
                                        understanding at the Peruvian-Colombian Conference, which
                                        should not be overlooked by responsible statesmen.</p>
                                    <p>We are not dealing with strict problems of law, susceptible
                                        of raising disturbing objections. We are dealing with a
                                        carefully prepared plan, back of which is a profound desire
                                        for harmony.</p>
                                    <p>But while viewing the juridical side of the question, it is
                                        only just to recognize that not only in the Agreement of
                                        Geneva, as also in the Boundary Treaty which caused
                                        difficulties between Colombia and Peru, the two Parties have
                                        rights and obligations which they maintain reciprocally. The
                                        equal position of the two States will facilitate with real
                                        efficacy, the work of civilization that they are
                                        undertaking.”</p>

                        <p>35. Your 57, April 5, 9 p.m., second paragraph. We of course have made no
                            statement to the Peruvian Ambassador which would warrant such an
                            impression. The last time the Ambassador discussed the Bio de Janeiro
                            negotiations in the Department Assistant Secretary Welles advised him
                            that all our information from Colombia indicated that an extension of
                            the mandate would be entirely unacceptable to Colombia; and that we of
                            course would make no move in support of the suggested extension.</p>
                        <p>While we are somewhat to doubt the wisdom of our making the suggestion to
                            the Peruvian Ambassador mentioned by Mello Franco, we will give careful
                            consideration to the idea and will advise you later.</p>

                        <p>233. Department’s 136, April 4, 5 p.m. With regard to second sentence of
                            your first paragraph Secretariat states that on attempting to get into
                            touch with Brazilian representative they find there is none available
                            since the Minister to Bern is resigning and the Consul at Geneva being
                            transferred. The Secretariat has addressed an urgent communication to
                            the latter with regard to his country’s representation on the Advisory
                            Committee through a Brazilian representative.</p>

                                received from Colombia refusing to agree to a prolongation of the
                                Leticia Commission’s mandate. While this refusal is definite the
                                Under Secretary General does not feel that it completely closes the
                                door to further consideration of this matter by Colombia. The note
                                will be distributed shortly when I shall telegraph further if

                        <p>19. Minister for Foreign Affairs called at my house last evening to hand
                            me a memorandum on the state of the negotiations at Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>Substance of the memorandum is that Colombia in February formally
                            proposed to Perú agreements for, (1) customs union on the Amazon. (2)
                            protection of the nations. (3) free navigation of the common rivers and
                            their tributaries, and declared herself ready to study agreements for
                            collaboration in the frontier regions and non-aggression.</p>
                        <p>This was never replied to by the Peruvian delegation.</p>
                        <p>In March the Peruvians formally proposed, (1) exchange of Leticia
                            quadrilateral for the Sucumbios triangle, (2) protocol to apply article
                                <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0411"/>9 of the 1922 treaty in
                            accordance with the stipulations in the memorandum of the Peruvian
                            Legation in Bogotá (presumably this refers to enclosure 3, the
                            Legation’s despatch No. 4465, September 27, 1932<note n="12"
                                xml:id="d429fn12">Not printed.</note>). (3) after acceptance and
                            termination of points 1 and 2 study of agreements similar to those
                            mentioned in Colombian proposal.</p>
                        <p>This proposal was rejected by the Colombian delegation and withdrawn by
                            the Peruvian.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum then gives Colombian motives for rejection. Am forwarding
                            full text by air mail.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs further told me this memorandum had been
                            drawn up to furnish information requested by the Brazilian
                            Government.</p>

                        <p>235. Consultative Committee on Leticia held two meetings today. In the
                            morning the discussion centered as anticipated on the state of
                            negotiations at Bio. The Brazilian representative made a short
                            declaration to the effect that his Government had done and would
                            continue to do all possible to further the negotiations and that
                            developments in the past week gave grounds for hopes for a successful
                            outcome. Somewhat later Eden<note n="13" xml:id="d430fn13">Anthony Eden,
                                British Lord Privy Seal and British representative on the Council of

                            Ambassador at Bio. He informed the Committee that the details were

                            negotiations.</p>

                            tentative accord had been reached. The British Ambassador urged that the
                            League do nothing at the present time to jeopardize the accord.</p>

                        <p>140. Your 235, April 12, 6 p.m. The Brazilian Ambassador advised the
                            Department today, by instruction of his Government, that the Leticia
                            negotiations at Rio had suddenly taken a very favorable turn, and that
                            the Brazilian Government feared that intervention by the League in the
                            question at this moment might endanger a successful accord between
                            Colombia and Peru. The Brazilian Government requested that the United
                            States Government support the suggestion it had made at Geneva that for
                            the reason above expressed, the League refrain for the time being from
                            any move in the matter. He was advised that this Government, of course,
                            could officially take no action in accordance with the request made, but
                            that the request of the Brazilian Government and the information given
                            would be transmitted to you for such informal and discreet use thereof
                            as you might deem it possible to make.</p>

                        <p>38. The Brazilian Ambassador called yesterday by instruction of his
                            Government to inform the Department that the Leticia negotiations at Rio
                            had suddenly taken a very favorable turn and to ask that this Government
                            support the request made by Brazil at Geneva that no action be taken by
                            the League at this time for fear that such action might jeopardize the
                            successful outcome of the negotiations. He was informed that while we
                            could take no official action, the information he communicated to us
                            would be at once cabled to our representative at Geneva for such
                            informal use as he might be able discreetly to make of it.</p>
                        <p>The Department was likewise informed yesterday by cable from Wilson at
                            Geneva that the British Ambassador in Rio had reported that he had
                            ascertained from the representatives of both Colombia and Perú and from
                            Mello Franco that a tentative accord had been reached and that the
                            British Ambassador had urged that the League take no action at the
                            present time. The Consultative Committee in Geneva decided yesterday
                            that in view of the state of the negotiations it would adjourn until
                            approximately April 30th without taking action.</p>

                        <p>The Department is likewise informed by the American Embassy in Lima that
                            the Peruvian Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that “he is almost

                        <p>60. Department’s 38, April 13, noon. Mello Franco whom I saw this
                            afternoon offers his apologies for failure to keep me currently informed
                            as had been promised. He explained he had been greatly upset by the
                            sudden death of his brother and was under the impression he had made
                            arrangements for me to be informed in the same way as the British
                            Ambassador who had requested an appointment but that he realizes now he
                            had failed to do so.</p>
                        <p>He states that while the situation has taken a distinctly favorable turn
                            the progress is not quite as great as indicated in the messages cited by
                            the Department. Colombia and Perú have agreed to reestablish their
                            diplomatic missions he believes with the rank of embassies. Aside from
                            this distinct step away from a breakdown of negotiations all that has
                            happened is agreement in principle on a series of points to be discussed
                            [apparent omission] the conference such as frontiers, frontiers police,
                            international waterways, customs, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>Several paragraphs dealing with these points have been drafted in detail
                            but not yet formally approved.</p>
                        <p>He states the negotiations suffered a relapse yesterday as a result of a
                            provocative speech made by the Peruvian delegate in Geneva which had
                            caused the Colombians to take the stand that they could not continue to
                            negotiate. He has urged Peruvian and Colombian Governments to warn their
                            delegates in Geneva to avoid controversy and hopes this will enable
                            negotiations to continue.</p>
                        <p>He expressed gratification at the adjournment of the League Committee and
                            added that if there was hope of real agreement this would be manifest
                            before the next meeting.</p>

                            Colombia, telephoned this morning to say that his attention had been
                            called to an article in <hi rend="italic">La Prensa</hi> of New York of
                            April 18 to the effect that the Secretary of State had replied to
                            questions of correspondents concerning the Leticia dispute and the
                            attitude of this Government by stating that if both Perú and Colombia
                            should so request we would extend our good offices in an effort to reach
                            a peaceful settlement of the dispute.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lozano said that in conversation with you he had suggested that the
                            United States should offer its good offices in the matter, and he wished
                            to inquire in order to report to his Government the exact significance
                            of the statement attributed to the Secretary. He said he had tried to
                            communicate with you but had been unable to get in touch with you.</p>
                        <p>I attach hereto the article in <hi rend="italic">La Prensa</hi> to which
                            Dr. Lozano referred, and also the memorandum of the press conference of
                            April 17.<note n="14" xml:id="d434fn14">Neither found attached to this

                                <p>“Good offices would be offered within our usual practice if the

                        <p>66. My 60, April 14, 5 p.m. Mello Franco tells me today he has completed
                            draft of a protocol embodying following points: <list>

                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Peruvian delegate told Mello Franco he was prepared to sign.
                            Colombian delegate stated he must consult his Government. Since then
                            nothing has been heard from Colombia but Peruvian has sent word that
                            nothing further should be done for the moment. He made an appointment to
                            see Mello Franco yesterday but did not appear. Mello Franco states that
                            while his protocol contains possibilities of a solution it has been his
                            experience that one side can always be depended upon to refuse if the
                            other accepts and he is not over-sanguine.</p>
                        <p>My reason for reporting the foregoing is that the press is filled with
                            reports of apparent agreements which appear to arise from a feud between
                            the Havas and United Press.</p>

                                point of view to the effect that the disposition of the Leticia
                                territory is the essence of the dispute. The suggestion is made that
                                Perú and Colombia might agree to negotiate on the basis of exchange
                                of the Leticia Trapezium for the right bank of the Putumayo; that
                                meanwhile the mandate of the Leticia Commission should be extended
                                for a period of not to exceed 6 months; that a statement should be
                                made at the time of the extension of the mandate; that the territory
                                would be handed over by the Commission to the Colombian Government

                                decided upon by the two parties; and that it would be understood

                        <p>68. Peruvian delegate tells me Colombians have refused to accept various
                            points in protocol described in my 66, April 24, 5 p.m. Maúrtua states
                            however that he has embarked on an “offensive of conciliation” and is
                            confident that within a short time he will be able to reach agreement
                            provided nothing untoward happens in Geneva. He is anxious that the
                            Committee scheduled to meet on May 2nd should be deferred as the only
                            way to avert statements by both sides which may prejudice chances of
                            success here. He has asked Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs to
                            instruct its representatives in this sense.</p>

                        <p>69. Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me this evening there is distinct
                            progress toward agreement on bases of protocol reported in my 66, April
                            24, 5 p.m. Colombian objections have been narrowed down to points of
                            detail about functions of administrative body and he believes Colombia
                            is responding to more generous attitude of Peruvians. Text of protocol
                            seems to be changing daily but as now drafted provides that unless
                            agreement is reached sooner negotiations shall continue here until June
                            23rd, that after that date they shall be carried on through diplomatic
                            channels between the two Governments; and that if agreement not reached
                            December 31st question shall go to World Court. During this period both
                            parties engage not to resort to force.</p>
                        <p>In view of hopeful situation and with acquiescence of both Governments,
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs transmitted to Brazilian representative at
                            Geneva an appeal from Mello Franco that discussion should be adjourned
                            until May 10th. Press flash just received announces President of
                            Committee has acquiesced.</p>

                            Peruvian Government now realizes that the treaty or frontier revision
                            should not be mixed up with the present settlement and is making no
                            effort to do so. However, he added that the Colombian Government
                            harbored misgivings that wires were being pulled at Geneva to influence
                            the League to confuse the issue of proposed settlement with the lapse of
                            the League mandate in Leticia. British Minister is telegraphing his
                            Government to urge that it do what it can to prevent this.</p>

                        <p>41. The Department is confidentially advised that an agreement between
                            Perú and Colombia appears to be near on all points under discussion save
                            eventual modification of the treaty of 1922; that the Colombian
                            Delegation insists upon the article contained in the Colombian counter
                            proposal, namely, that the treaty cannot be modified except by joint
                            consent of the two contracting parties; while the Peruvian Delegation is
                            maintaining that if the treaty can only be modified by joint consent of
                            the contracting parties and a resort to arbitration is made impossible,
                            there is no hope for an eventual permanent settlement of the questions
                            involved should direct diplomatic negotiations for amendment of the
                            treaty prove unsuccessful. In this connection, the Department is further
                            advised that Mello Franco either has or intends to propose a compromise
                            formula covering the question under reference. Please endeavor to obtain
                            informally from Mello Franco any friendly compromise he may have offered
                            or if such suggestion has not yet been made, endeavor to ascertain what
                            compromise proposal he may have in mind. You may state to him that this
                            Government is deeply interested in the negotiations which are being
                            conducted under his auspices for the pacific settlement of the Leticia
                            dispute and would greatly appreciate confidential advice from him as to

                        <p>73. Department’s urgent telegram 41, May 9, noon, delivered this morning.
                            Mello Franco’s eldest daughter died last night and was buried this
                            evening. He is confined to bed as a result of the shock and I have of
                            course been unable to see him.</p>
                        <p>From Peruvian sources I learn that at a meeting, just before his
                            daughter’s death, Mello Franco drew up in the course of discussion a
                            compromise formula which sought to conciliate the points of view
                            indicated in the Department’s telegram and others. Peruvians consider it
                            generally acceptable but have referred it to Lima for approval.
                            Colombian Foreign Minister tells me he considers the formula more a
                            series of ideas than a text and that while he has telegraphed it home he
                            feels that it must still be the subject of considerable adjustment.</p>
                        <p>Peruvian delegate has promised me the text of this document and I shall
                            telegraph it at once on receipt.</p>
                        <p>Despite unenthusiastic attitude of the Colombians, which I believe to be
                            a calculated part of their strategy, I gather that both delegations are
                            really hopeful of reaching agreement.</p>

                        <p>75. My 73, May 10, 7 p.m. Following is the full text in translation of
                            Mello Franco’s compromise formula which is communicated in confidence:

                                <p>“Article 1. Perú sincerely deplores as she has previously
                                    declared the events which occurred at Leticia on September 1,
                                    1932, and the others which without the responsibility of her
                                    Government have immediate connection therewith and perturbed her
                                    relations with Colombia.</p>
                                <p>The two governments having resolved to reestablish their
                                    relations Perú manifests the desire that these be restored with
                                    the intimate friendship of the past and the profound cordiality
                                    of the two sister peoples. Colombia sharing these sentiments
                                    declares that her proposals are identic.</p>
                                <p>For this purpose Perú and Colombia agree simultaneously to
                                    accredit Legations in Bogotá and in Lima.</p>
                                <p>Article 2. The boundary treaty of March 24, 1922, ratified on

                                    of the parties or by decision of international justice under the

                                <p>Article 3. The negotiations between the two countries will be
                                    continued through normal diplomatic channels in order that all
                                    pending problems may receive a just, lasting and satisfactory
                                    solution observing during the course of these negotiations the
                                    principles established by the present protocol.</p>
                                <p>Article 4. Having in view the common necessities of the two
                                    states in the Amazon basin Perú and Colombia will enter into
                                    special agreements concerning customhouses, commerce, free
                                    navigation of the river, protection of settlers, traffic
                                    policing of frontiers and all others which may be necessary to
                                    obviate any difficulties which arise or may arise in the
                                    frontier region between the two countries.</p>
                                <p>Article 5. For the same purpose the two governments will conclude
                                    an agreement demilitarizing the frontier under which they will
                                    be obligated to maintain there only civilian authorities and the
                                    police forces strictly indispensable for the needs of internal
                                    public order.</p>
                                <p>The two Governments will nominate to this end a technical
                                    commission composed of an equal number of members of each
                                    nationality presided over alternatively month by month by the
                                    highest ranking official of each, the first president to be
                                    selected by the drawing of lots. The seat of the commission will
                                    be fixed by mutual accord between the Governments.</p>
                                <p>Article 6. In order to supervise and verify the execution of the
                                    agreements covered by clause 4, a commission of three members
                                    will be created, nominated by the Governments of Peru, Colombia
                                    and Brazil, the president of which will be the last named. The
                                    seat of the commission will be in territory of one or the other
                                    contracting countries within the region to which the
                                    above-mentioned agreements apply, it having the right to move
                                    from one point to another within the boundaries, in order more
                                    effectively to collaborate with the local authorities of both
                                    states for the maintenance of a régime of permanent peace and
                                    neighborly relations on the common frontier.</p>
                                <p>Sub-paragraph 1. This mixed commission has no police power,
                                    administrative function or judicial competence in the
                                    territories subject to the jurisdiction of the High Contracting
                                    Parties whose authorities there shall exercise their full
                                    powers.</p>
                                <p>Sub-paragraph 2. If, however, in the execution of the
                                    above-mentioned agreements which shall form an integral part of
                                    the present protocol there should arise disputes due to
                                    decisions which have violated any of the mentioned agreements or
                                    which refer to an interpretation of those agreements or to the
                                    nature and extension of the reparations due to the breaking of
                                    one of them and such disputes are brought by the interested
                                    parties to the attention of the commission, the commission will
                                    forward these cases with all information to the two Governments
                                    in order that they may in mutual understanding take the
                                    necessary adequate measures.</p>
                                <p>Sub-paragraph 3. In the absence [of] this understanding and after
                                    the period of 90 days has elapsed counting from the date of the
                                    communication to the two Governments the commission will finally
                                    resolve the question by a majority of votes.</p>
                                <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0421"/>
                                <p>Sub-paragraph 4. The two Governments will solicit the cooperation
                                    of the Government of Brazil for the composition of the
                                    commission.</p>
                                <p>Sub-article 7. Perú and Colombia solemnly obligate themselves not
                                    to make war nor to employ directly or indirectly force as a
                                    means of solution for their present problems or for any others
                                    which may occur in the future. If in any eventuality they do not
                                    reach a solution through direct diplomatic negotiations either
                                    of the High Contracting Parties may appeal to the procedure
                                    established by article 36 of the statutes of the Court of
                                    International Justice.</p>
                                <p>Only sub-paragraph. In this case the High Contracting Parties
                                    reciprocally promise to agree among themselves as to the means
                                    for the extension of the sentence. If, however, they do not
                                    reach an agreement the Court itself will stipulate the terms as
                                    provided in article 38 of its statutes,”</p>

                        <p>27. I asked for an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this
                            morning to find out what was delaying the negotiations at Rio de
                            Janeiro.</p>
                        <p>The Minister informed me that Mello Franco’s formula was on the whole
                            acceptable except that he wished to clarify the clause regarding
                            possible appeal to the Permanent Court of International Justice and to
                            limit this appeal to procedure established by article 36 of the Court’s
                            statute as it was clear that Perú intended refer the case to the
                            Court.</p>
                        <p>A much greater complication, however, was an addition to Mello’s formula
                            proposed by Maúrtua which tended to enlarge still further the
                            jurisdiction of the Court and which if accepted by the Colombian
                            Government would amount to giving the Court the powers of an arbitral
                            tribunal. This the Minister considered totally unacceptable and he had
                            [sent?] a memorandum to that effect to the President this morning which
                            was now being considered at a Cabinet meeting. He added that my request
                            to be received had been providential for him as an excuse for not
                            attending the meeting which would have been painful for him. He said
                            that he could not assume responsibility for making concessions along
                            these lines and he expected tender his resignation today or tomorrow
                            although this depended on the result of the Cabinet meeting.</p>
                        <p>In further explanation his attitude he pointed out that in adhering to
                            the Court Perú had made a reservation excepting from the Court’s
                            jurisdiction acts prior to the ratification. Maúrtua’s proposal would
                                <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0422"/>eliminate this reservation.
                            As Colombia’s ratification had been on a reciprocal basis the acceptance
                            of Maúrtua’s proposal would require special approval of the Colombian
                            Congress which he feared would entail bitter debate, stir up bad feeling
                            in both countries and make it more difficult to reach a settlement.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>While the Minister specifically disclaimed being a party man I have the
                            impression that internal politics have influenced his decision.</p>

                            states that Colombian delegation has practically accepted principle of
                            solution embodied in Mello Franco’s protocol (my 75, May 10, 11 a.m.
                                [<hi rend="italic">p.m.?</hi>) but that Colombians have now adopted
                            “evasive attitude” as to conclusion of agreements referred to in
                            articles 4, 5 and 6. Peruvians feel that the agreements covering the
                            provisional régime in the frontier district should be incorporated in
                            the protocol as proposed by Mello Franco and provided in numbered
                            paragraph 2 of article 6 whereas the Colombians are now advocating
                            concluding a protocol confined to general principles and defers the
                            agreements in question to subsequent negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Maúrtua talked sensibly of the existing situation. He says he feels it is
                            imperative to conclude full agreement such as that outlined in Mello
                            Franco’s protocol in order to avert disastrous consequences which at
                            best might be a resumption of hostilities and at worst hostilities and
                            political upheavals in both countries. He says that he is willing to be
                            generous in an effort to meet specific Colombian desiderata but that he
                            feels there is no excuse for failure to reach early agreement and for
                            that reason he inquires whether our Government would feel disposed to
                            talk the matter over with the Colombians in a friendly way pointing out
                            the danger of delay and our earnest hope that some means may be found of
                            concluding full agreement before the expiration of the League
                            mandate.</p>
                        <p>I told Maúrtua I could not of course answer his question but that I would
                            report his conversation and that he might be sure it would be considered
                            in the light of our deep interest in the peaceful solution of this
                            difficulty.</p>
                        <p>While I have not discussed that phase of the matter in sufficient detail
                            with the Colombians to make any definite assertion I must say <pb
                                n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0423"/>that I brought away from my
                            last night’s talk with the Colombian chief delegate the impression that
                            he was anxious to prolong the negotiations and avoid an early and
                            complete agreement.</p>
                        <p>If you feel that you can talk with the Colombians in the sense indicated
                            an indication of your views might well have a deciding influence.</p>

                        <p>28. My 27, May 11, 1 p.m. President sent for me this afternoon and
                            explained in detail the points under discussion at Rio.</p>
                        <p>Three of the difficulties are minor. The first is that Perú while
                            expressing regret for the events that occurred wishes to add “although
                            she has no responsibility for them”. The second is how to arrange for
                            the respective demilitarization. The third refers to the powers of the
                            commission. Perú wants the commission to have power to make a definite
                            resolution regarding indemnification for any infraction of the
                            agreements if within 90 days after notification the offending Government
                            shall not have taken the necessary action. The Colombian Government is
                            afraid of giving such power to the commission and desires that the
                            commission’s resolution shall not have executive force and to be able to
                            take the matter to The Hague if necessary.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and most serious is in substance [what] the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs told me this morning. The President gave me the text of
                            article No. 7 of the Mello formula. After the preamble which is
                            acceptable to both parties it reads as follows: “Sole article. In this
                            case the High Contracting Parties bind themselves reciprocally to agree
                            between themselves as to the means of execution of the sentence. If they
                            do not reach an agreement the same Court shall ordain under the terms of
                            article 38 of the respective statute.” Or as an alternative to the
                            second sentence “If nevertheless they do not reach an agreement there is
                            attributed to the same Court besides its ordinary competence the faculty
                            of making effective the sentence in which has been declared the right of
                            one of the contracting parties”. The President said Colombia could not
                            accept the first but possibly the second. Colombia had however proposed
                            a substitute as follows: “In this case the parties recognize that the
                            Court can determine the form in which its sentence is to be
                            executed.”</p>
                        <p>While he knew I had seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning
                            the only reference he made to Peru’s reservations in adhering <pb
                                n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0424"/>to the Court was to say that if
                            Perú wished to annul their reservations that was Peru’s affair and could
                            not be objected to by Colombia which had made no reservations to its act
                            of adherence.</p>

                                correctly, to make possible an earlier reestablishment of Colombian
                                sovereignty by substituting mixed commission as soon as formula
                                adopted for League’s Commission, Colombian authority to be installed

                                at first take charge of the “direct” negotiations between the two
                                countries. He seems certain mixed commission is not to have seat at
                                Leticia except for brief period as it takes over from League
                                Commission <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> apparently with

                                printed.</note> Meeting referred to in my 84, May 16, 2 p.m., has
                            just terminated. Mello Franco informs me that remaining two points have
                            been agreed upon in principle by delegates here who are telegraphing
                            agreed changes and additions in his compromise protocol to Bogotá and
                            Lima for approval. Point 1 as proposed by Colombia, is redrafting of
                            beginning of article 1 to read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Perú sincerely deplores the events which occurred beginning on
                                    September 1, 1930 [<hi rend="italic">1932</hi>], and which have
                                    perturbed its relation with Colombia. The two countries et
                                    cetera.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Point 2 is an addition to paragraph 3 of article No. 6 suggested by Mello
                            Franco in following language: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“From this decision either of the Governments may appeal within a
                                    period of 30 days to a court of arbitration to be set up in Rio
                                    de Janeiro and composed of the President of the Supreme Court of
                                    Brazil, the Federal Judge of the First District and the
                                    Solicitor General of the Republic.”</p>
                            </quote></p>

                        <p>Complete agreement is therefore contingent upon favorable decision in
                            Lima and Bogotá. Mello Franco would value any support you feel justified
                            in giving in conversations with Peruvian and Colombian representatives
                            in Washington and possibly through our representatives in Bogotá and
                            Lima. If two Governments approve these changes the political aspect of
                            the Leticia question may be considered as settled, there will only be
                            remaining drafting of agreements for provisional régime in frontier
                            regions which are to form integral part of protocol. I should appreciate
                            any views you can give me for my guidance in conversations with
                            Colombian and Peruvian delegates.</p>

                        <p>30. The Secretary of the Foreign Office sent for me this afternoon to
                            tell me, first, that Colombia had accepted the alternative formula of
                            Mello Franco for article 7 (see my telegram 28<note n="20"
                                xml:id="d451fn20">May 11, 5 p.m., <ref target="#pg_353">p.
                                353</ref>.</note>). Second, that Perú had now suggested fundamental
                            modifications of the supplementary agreements to the Mello formula;
                            namely, those mentioned in the second paragraph of my telegram 19, April
                            11, noon [<hi rend="italic">11 a.m.?</hi>], which are an integral part
                            of the protocol under the Mello formula. He then handed me the text of
                            the agreements as proposed by Colombia. These are quite inoffensive and
                            text will be forwarded by air mail. As I did not see how their subject
                            matter could lend itself to serious differences I asked what the
                            Peruvian proposals were. He did not know but said he would ask at the
                            Palace if they had received them.</p>
                        <p>On account of these sudden Peruvian proposals no discussion of the minor
                            difficulties mentioned in my telegram 28 has yet begun.</p>

                        <p>18. We are advised by Mello Franco that the Colombian and Peruvian
                            delegations at Rio de Janeiro are in agreement on his compromise
                            formula, including agreement in principle on his proposals relating to
                            the two points which had remained for settlement; namely, a redrafting
                            of article 1 of the formula and an addition to paragraph 3 <pb n="357"
                                xml:id="pg_357" facs="0427"/>of article 6; and that complete
                            agreement therefore now rests upon a favorable decision in Bogotá and
                            Lima.</p>
                        <p>Please see the Acting Foreign Minister, advise him orally of the
                            foregoing, and say that your Government on the basis of the information
                            which it possesses regarding Mello Franco’s compromise formula, regards
                            it as equitable and as offering an honorable and peaceful method of
                            reaching a permanent solution of this serious controversy. This
                            Government very much hopes that it may be accepted by both Colombia and
                            Peru. You may add that we are expressing the same views at Lima.<note

                            he has made to cover the remaining two points, is equitable and offers

                            accepted by both delegations at last night’s meeting. It would therefore

                            paragraph 3 of article 6.</p>

                        <p>89. My 87, May 18, 10 a.m. Mello Franco has telegraphed Najera stating
                            that agreement is practically achieved and expressing the hope that
                            matter will not be discussed in Geneva lest something be said or done to
                            prejudice agreement. Brazilian representative at Geneva has received
                            instructions in the same sense from the Foreign Office and it is hoped
                            you will feel justified in authorizing Wilson to act in his discretion
                            to prevent any untoward developments.</p>

                        <p>31. I have just seen the President as there is no acting Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs and gave him your message. He told me that as to article
                            1 the delegations were now in agreement but that as to paragraph 3 of
                            article 6 the [Peruvian] President wished to have after the reference to
                            the appeal to the Court the words “without our prejudice of the
                            provisional execution” and to this he could not agree as it put too much
                            power in the hands of the commission. He pointed out that from the facts
                            of the case nobody of any importance would accept membership on such a
                            commission and what would amount to practically the power of final
                            decision could not be left in their hands without the prior right of
                            appeal.</p>
                        <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0429"/>
                        <p>I then asked him if he could tell me what were the fundamental
                            modifications referred to by Gonzales in my telegram 30 of May 17, 6
                            p.m. He said that Maúrtua wished to make part of the agreements a
                            settlement of the Araña claim which amounts to 10 million pesos. However
                            the Colombian delegation have telegraphed that Maúrtua had withdrawn
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The President seems confident that an agreement is imminent as Perú can
                            hardly insist on the commission’s decisions being carried out prior to
                            the result of an appeal to The Hague …</p>

                            No. 101—May 24, 8 P.M., and previous correspondence, I have the honor to
                            enclose herewith a copy and translation of the agreement signed in this
                            city on May 24, 1934, between the Colombian and Peruvian delegations
                            with respect to the Leticia matter.</p>
                        <p>The agreement has been extremely well received in this city on all sides.
                            Not only the Colombian and Peruvian delegates have expressed their great
                            satisfaction in interviews granted to various local papers but also the
                            local press has been unanimous and profuse in its expressions of
                            approval. High praise has been showered upon the ex-Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs, Mr. Mello Franco, for his indefatigable work of conciliation.
                                <hi rend="italic">A Nação</hi> has suggested that the Nobel Peace
                            Prize for 1934 should certainly be given to him and this proposal has
                            been echoed not only in the local press but evidently also in other
                            countries. Particular gratification has been expressed at the success of
                            this peace endeavor in view of precarious and unpromising situations
                            which exist in other parts of the world.</p>
                        <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0431"/>
                        <p>The Department will observe that the protocol and additional act settle
                            everything down to the minutest detail, with the exception of the one
                            vital question—the modification of the boundaries established in the
                            1922 treaty, which is left to “negotiations between the two countries
                            through normal diplomatic channels” or perhaps to “a decision of
                            International Justice”. Nevertheless, the value of the present
                            agreements should not be minimized. They furnish an invaluable sedative
                            to overly excited national feelings, and particularly in view of the
                            provisions of Article 7 of the Protocol it would be difficult for the
                            countries to go to war even should diplomatic negotiations break
                            down.</p>
                        <p>In closing I wish to repeat the information forwarded in my telegram No.

                                The two Republics having resolved to reestablish their relations,
                                Perú expresses the wish that these may be restored with the same
                                intimate friendship as in the past, and the profound cordiality of
                                two sister peoples. Colombia shares these sentiments and declares

                            for the purpose of defending it.</p>
                        <p>Rio de Janeiro Pact is encountering unexpected difficulties in the
                            Colombian Congress due entirely to domestic politics. Besides Fabio
                            Lozano and Pedro Maria Carreno who are the leading opponents it is
                            understood that Laureano Gómez has decided to support some amendments to
                            articles 2 and 7. Last week Chancellor Urdaneta told Minister Whitehouse
                            that his substitute in the Senate who is a follower of Laureano might
                            not support the Pact without amendments and that if the opposition
                            appeared too strong he might resign from the Cabinet and assume his
                            Senate seat. His now having taken this step indicates that the situation
                            is one to cause concern. As the Pact will probably be returned today by
                            the Senate Committee to the floor of that body it is believed that more
                            definite information regarding the line-up among the Senators may be
                            available within a few days.</p>
                        <p>You might consider the advisability of explaining personally concern
                            regarding matter to the Colombian Chargé d’Affaires in Washington who
                            would undoubtedly communicate with his father-in-law, Dr. Carreno who is
                            one of the leading opponents of the Pact.</p>

                        <p>103. My telegram No. 100, December 10, noon. Senate Foreign Relations
                            Committee has named Fabio Lozano and one other to draft a majority
                            report which will not be submitted to Senate until the end of this
                            week.</p>
                        <p>Though President López has expressed himself to be favorable to the Pact,
                            he has stated that he will do nothing to influence the decision of
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Guillermo Valencia, one of the signers of the Pact, remains in Popayán,
                            declining the Senate’s invitation to appear before it to defend his
                            work.</p>
                        <p>Pact is considered safe in the House. In the Senate with Liberal Lozano
                            in opposition and Conservative Urdaneta voting with the <pb n="371"
                                xml:id="pg_371" facs="0441"/>Liberals and Pomanistas in favor of the
                            Pact as it stands, the remaining Conservative Senators led by Laureano
                            Gómez can cause a tie in a decisive vote.</p>
                        <p>Important factors are Gómez’ personal hatred of Olaya and Urdaneta, the
                            desire of all the legislators to force the President to summon another
                            extraordinary session of Congress after the termination of the present
                            one on December 31, and the maneuvers of the Conservatives to increase
                            their power over the Government. They may allow the Pact to pass after
                            they have secured some concessions from the Liberals, but as yet they
                            show no sign of being influenced by considerations of
                            internationalism.</p>

                        <p>104. My telegram No. 103, December 12, 4 p.m. Urdaneta, Eduardo Santos,
                            Luíz Cano and other defenders of Rio de Janeiro Pact appear to be
                            extremely pessimistic regarding its fate, believing that for reasons of
                            domestic politics the Conservatives will force a tie in the Senate and
                            thereby prevent approval. Some persons who have spoken to President
                            López have found him unconcerned and there is a report that he has an
                            understanding with Conservative leader Gómez that after attacking the
                            Pact several Conservative Senators will abstain from voting and allow it
                            to pass. Few of the Pact’s friends appear to give credence to this
                            report though some believe that if President López should exercise only
                            a slight pressure the approval of Pact would be assured.</p>
                        <p>Brazilian Minister has recommended to his Government by cable that
                            Brazil, Great Britain and the United States make friendly
                            representations to the Colombian Government pointing out the unfortunate
                            consequences that would arise from nonratification of the Pact. I
                            believe that a public appeal in which Brazil and the United States were
                            the major participants might fail, both of these nations having been
                            attacked at different times by the critics of the Pact. However,
                            individual representations through Colombian diplomatic representatives
                            in these and other countries to President López might produce the
                            desired result. In order to avoid any misinterpretation it might be
                            advisable that an appeal if public be made by all the American nations
                            or by the League of Nations.</p>

                        <p>126. 1. Prefacing his statement by saying he was speaking to me after
                            consultation with the President and in strictest confidence, the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon informed me this Government
                            is seriously alarmed by the course of affairs at Bogotá as reported by
                            the Peruvian Minister there, Belaunde, in connection with the
                            ratification of the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro for the settlement of the
                            Leticia dispute.</p>
                        <p>2. He said there was no doubt whatever here as to López’ sincerity but
                            that it was felt he was overconfident and had erred in his tactics in
                            leaving the question for the free disposition of the Congress.</p>
                        <p>3. He pointed out that ratification should take place prior to December
                            31, that the report of the special commission will not be made until
                            about the 16th, that Senators supposed to be favorable are wavering and
                            that Laureano Gómez and Fabio Lozano are working more and more
                            successfully to defeat ratification.</p>
                        <p>4. The Foreign Minister stated that notwithstanding President Benavides’
                            popularity in Loreto due to his Caquetá success in 1911 it would be
                            impossible for this Government to control Loreto or what might happen
                            there in case the Protocol should fail of ratification at Bogotá. He
                            added that there was a tie and a deadlock in the Colombian Senate even
                            with Urdaneta’s participation and that he viewed the situation with the
                            gravest concern.</p>
                        <p>5. He definitely inquired whether our Government would be willing in the
                            interest of peace and good understanding to send some appropriate
                            message to López or at least make an inquiry which would make the
                            Colombian Government aware of our interest and concern so the Rio de
                            Janeiro Protocol would be approved and ratified.</p>
                        <p>6. I expressed some incredulity as to the situation being as menacing as
                            it appeared but the Minister who is not an alarmist informed me most
                            earnestly he was seriously alarmed.</p>
                        <p>7. And the Embassy has learned enough of the growing unrest here and the
                            background of the recent revolutionary outbreak to take the Minister,
                            who reflects the President’s attitude and very likely that of the
                            Cabinet as well, at his word. In any event an adverse reaction in Loreto
                            would be a difficult and costly thing to control.</p>
                        <p>8. I expressed my sincere sympathy with the Minister’s desire to avoid
                            unfortunate developments and said I would lay situation at once before
                            our Government so its full import would be realized and it could do what
                            it might deem necessary in the circumstances. Please instruct. Not
                            repeated to Bogotá.</p>

                        <p>106. Conversation with Olaya and Luíz Cano lead me to believe that
                            inquiries from individual American nations and more especially from the
                            appropriate committee of the League of Nations as to the present status
                            of the Rio de Janeiro Pact in the Colombian Congress might result in a
                            change in attitude on the part of those opposed to the Pact. This
                            inquiry could be based on the fact that according to article 9
                            ratifications must be exchanged by December 31. The Senate will probably
                            commence its formal discussions on Monday afternoon. If action is to be
                            taken it would be preferable that it be done before all the
                            Conservatives have committed themselves to oppose the Pact.</p>

                            messages from British Minister at Bogotá to Foreign Office, London,
                            repeated to Lima and Rio de Janeiro, stating prospects of ratification
                            of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol by Colombian Congress steadily decrease
                            and that while the Colombian people approve the settlement, the Congress
                            is apt to defeat it.</p>

                                potentialities for trouble in Loreto and the Peruvian belief that

                        <p>114. President López today issued decree declaring that the extraordinary
                            sessions of Congress are prorogued for an indefinite period to enable it
                            to finish its study of the Rio Pact. At the same time, he transmitted a
                            message stating that although a majority of the Senate appears to
                            consider the time accorded that body to arrive at an opinion to be
                            insufficient he still hopes that in the interest of international
                            harmony it may approve Pact before December 31st, the day specified in
                            article 9 for the exchange of ratifications.</p>
                        <p>The Senate has held several secret sessions recently in one of which it
                            is understood that the Foreign Minister reported the messages which had
                            been received from foreign countries and several Conservative Senators
                            vehemently protested against foreign intervention for the purpose of
                            coercing the Colombian Senate. The alleged forceful intervention of
                            Brazil and the United States at the request of the President of Perú was
                            the subject of criticism in the public session of the House of
                            Representatives yesterday. The President of the Senate Laureano Gómez
                            suggested in that body day before yesterday that the Government of Perú
                            be asked whether it agrees with the contention of the former Colombian
                            delegates to Rio de Janeiro Conference that articles 2 and 7 of the Pact
                            give the International Court the power to interpret only the Rio de
                            Janeiro Pact and not the Salomon–Lozano Treaty. It is understood that
                            the Government has been considering the suggestion.</p>

                        <p>At my request the Minister of Colombia came in. I said to him that we had
                            knowledge that the Consul General of Colombia in New York was enlisting
                            a force of American aviators and mechanics to go to Colombia under
                            contract to serve in peace and war; that in the event of war they were
                            to serve in the armed forces of Colombia and to take part in
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>I explained to the Minister the provisions of Sections 21, 22 and 25 of
                            Title 18 of the United States Code, under the title “Offenses against
                            Neutrality”, particularly Section 22, and said to him that it was clear
                            that the steps being taken in this regard by the Colombian Consul
                            General were in violation of the spirit, if not the strict letter of the
                            law. I said that we, of course, did not believe that the Colombian
                            Government or its officials had desired to do anything contrary to our
                            laws or which would cause the Government of the United States
                            embarrassment; but the situation with regard to the law was as I had
                            explained it. I then spoke of the consistent policy which this
                            Government had followed ever since the outbreak of the Leticia affair,
                            with which Dr. Lozano was thoroughly familiar, of maintaining a position
                            of absolute impartiality and neutrality as between the two countries. I
                            said that Secretary Hull had asked me to discuss this situation with the
                            Minister, and in view of the provisions of the law mentioned, to ask the
                            Minister to issue instructions to the Consul General in New York not to
                            make any further contracts or arrangements with American citizens under
                            which the latter agree to serve in the armed forces of Colombia and to
                            call in the existing contracts and delete from them the clause to this
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lozano said that this was the first he had known of the existence of
                            such a law in the United States. He said that, of course, the last thing
                            in the world his Government would wish to do would be to violate any
                            provisions of United States law or to cause any difficulties for our
                            Government. He said that his Legation had nothing <pb n="378"
                                xml:id="pg_378" facs="0448"/>to do with making contracts or
                            arrangements with Americans to go to Colombia, and that anything done to
                            this effect had been by the Consulate General. He spoke at some length
                            of the background of the Leticia affair, stating that Colombia was not
                            making preparations to make war on Peru, but only to defend herself,
                            that not only legally but morally Colombia was in the right, since the
                            Leticia territory had been granted to her by a treaty duly ratified by
                            both countries, the validity of which Perú did not contest, and that
                            Perú had violated her obligations under the Briand–Kellogg Pact<note

                            Leticia territory.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Lozano said that he would at once advise the Consul General in New
                            York to “suspend all activities” of the nature complained of, and that
                            he would cable to President Olaya a full report of the situation,
                            requesting that instructions be sent to the Consul General along the
                            lines desired by us. As I had mentioned that it was reported that a
                            large number of these aviators were to embark on the SS <hi
                                rend="italic">Colombia</hi> on April 12 from New York, Dr. Lozano
                            said that he would advise me immediately of the action taken by
                            President Olaya.</p>
                        <p>I took occasion to tell Dr. Lozano of the great concern with which
                            Secretary Hull regards this conflict between Colombia and Perú and of
                            the Secretary’s fervent hope that both countries will exhaust every
                            possible measure of conciliation, discussion and negotiation in an
                            effort to work out an equitable and lasting solution by peaceful means
                            and to avoid warfare, which would be tragic in its consequences for the
                            American continent. Dr. Lozano said that he appreciated the Secretary’s
                            sentiments, and that he wished very much to have me lay before the
                            Secretary his views of the legal and moral position of Colombia as the
                            aggrieved country endeavoring to protect her rights against an
                            aggressor.</p>

                            yesterday notification given by Governor Canal Zone under orders of
                            Department of State repair facilities at Panama would be denied to

                            and other Cabinet members. I assured Minister any measures taken could
                            not have been directed against Perú and would certainly be applied with
                            absolute impartiality. Freyre has been instructed to make

                            partiality to Colombia, an impression I am endeavoring to remove as well
                            as I am able, but being in the wrong this Government will inevitably
                            misinterpret many things.</p>

                        <p>31. Your 45, April 10, 11 p.m. The Peruvian Ambassador was informed by
                            the Department yesterday that the contracts which had originally been
                            entered into by the Colombian Consul General in New York with American
                            aviators have been withdrawn and cancelled as the result of
                            representations made to the Colombian Government by our Government that
                            such contracts involved a violation of our neutrality laws. The
                            Ambassador was also informed that the Colombian Government has been
                            further advised that this Government was strongly opposed to the
                            employment of American aviators by Colombia in any capacity but that if
                            the Colombian Government nevertheless engaged the services of American
                            aviators to go as civilian instructors, any contracts which might in the
                            future be entered into with our citizens for such purpose must contain a
                            clause specifically providing for the automatic cancellation of such
                            contracts in the event that Colombia engages in hostilities with any
                            other country.</p>
                        <p>Freyre was also told that we desired to offer every assistance both to
                            Colombia and to Perú in the cause of peace in any way which the two
                            Governments might deem proper to accept, but that we could not offer any
                            assistance in preparations for war to either nation. An identical
                            statement was made to the Minister of Colombia.</p>
                        <p>You may repeat these assurances to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            say that our refusal to facilitate preparations for war by either
                            Government has been maintained and will be maintained with the utmost
                            impartiality.</p>
                        <p>You may further repeat, as emphatically as possible, that this Government
                            is animated by the most sincere friendship for the Government of Peru,
                            as it is for the Government of Colombia. It is surprised that there
                            could be any question of this fact on the part of the President of Perú
                            and of the members of his Cabinet and that it feels sure that when due
                            consideration is given to the fact that we have refused all facilities
                            which might assist any warlike preparations both to <pb n="381"
                                xml:id="pg_381" facs="0451"/>Colombia and Perú with absolute
                            impartiality, any misapprehension which may have existed on this point

                        <p>As regards recent reports that American aviators are going to Colombia
                            under contract to serve in the Colombian military forces in the event of
                            war, the Department understands that the facts are that the Colombian
                            Government has engaged the services of American aviators to act as
                            instructors, and that the contracts provide that in the event of a war
                            in which Colombia might be involved the contracts will be automatically
                            cancelled and the aviators free to return to the United States.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it should be stated that the Government of the United
                            States disapproves of American citizens taking service in the armed
                            forces of any foreign Government and if Americans do so it is on their
                            sole responsibility and risk and they cannot look to their own
                            Government for protection while in such service. Americans holding
                            reserve commissions in our army will forfeit them if they enter the
                            military service of a foreign country.</p>
                        <p>It is the policy of this Government, with regard to actual or potential
                            conflicts between countries on the American continent, to give all
                            possible assistance toward a peaceful settlement, but to refrain
                            scrupulously from permitting its facilities to be used by either party
                            in preparation for possible hostilities.</p>

                            stated as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Department of State considers that developments between Perú
                                    and Colombia make it advisable to follow strictly the policy set
                                    out in State Department’s letter to the War Department of
                                    January 20, 1933, namely, that no facilities of any nature of
                                    this Government should be placed at the disposal of either the
                                    Government of Colombia or the Government of Perú which would
                                    assist them in their preparations for possible hostilities.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I desire to confirm this statement of policy which will of course apply
                            to the visit of the <hi rend="italic">Bolognesi</hi> and the two
                            destroyers to the Canal. In declining the request to re-boiler and
                            overhaul these vessels it is suggested that explanation might be made by
                            the Canal authorities to the Peruvian representatives that the
                            concentration of the fleet near the Canal makes it impossible to grant
                            such facilities, rather than to base the refusal on any general
                            statement of policy.</p>
                        <p>In view of the present acute state of relations between Colombia and Perú
                            I submit for your consideration the advisability of having any request
                            for facilities made by representatives of either Government to the Canal
                            authorities transmitted for your decision before any action is taken
                            thereon by the Canal authorities.</p>

                            No. 45 of April 10th, 11 p.m. and to the Department’s confidential
                            instructions No. 31 of April 11, 3 p.m., and to my telegram No. 48 of
                            April 12th, 3 p.m., regarding American aviators who may take service
                            with foreign governments and the refusal of our Government to facilitate
                            preparations for war. The substance of the Department’s message was at
                            once communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who immediately
                            stated that he had already received a report from the Peruvian
                            Ambassador in Washington, which caused him the greatest
                            satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Polo begged me to say to the Department that he took the message I
                            was instructed to deliver to him as being an expression of the
                            friendliest character and one which would give great satisfaction <pb
                                n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0453"/>to the President and members of
                            the Peruvian Government. He indicated that he would take pains to bring
                            our message to the President’s attention and to that of all other
                            officials who have any concern with the present foreign policy of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Polo referred once more to what he called a “disconformity” between
                            the treatment accorded Perú in the matter of the Panagra aviators in

                            of Office, The Panama Canal, and which was by the latter quoted in

                            in connection with my despatch No. 3370 of April 17, 1934 and my further

                        <p>During the course of the conversation the President referred again—as he
                            had done on the 16th—to the denial of dry-dock facilities to the <hi
                                rend="italic">Bolognesi</hi> at Panama and to the engagement of
                            American aviators by the Colombian Government, intimating that the
                            attitude of our Government was unfriendly and that requests from us such
                            as that regarding the ratification of the Silver Agreement came with
                            somewhat poor grace in the present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The President said that for the last three days the press agencies have
                            been receiving a flood of messages regarding the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Bolognesi</hi> and that he had been obliged to have the censorship
                            suppress every one of them as they were of so incendiary a character
                            that for them to be published would undoubtedly arouse resentment
                            against the members of the American colony and he was anxious for that
                            not to happen.</p>
                        <p>The President was particularly incensed by a report that the Colombian
                            Government had offered a prize of a thousand dollars to any American
                            aviator for every Peruvian plane brought down and said he wondered
                            whether he should not engage some American aviators himself and offer
                            them a higher price for every Colombian plane brought down. He wondered
                            what would happen if Americans should find themselves fighting each
                            other!</p>
                        <p>Dr. Polo, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, had come into the room while
                            I was talking to the President and accordingly I was able to turn <pb
                                n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0455"/>to him and ask him to tell the
                            President what had been said in the Department’s Instructions No. 31 of
                            April 11, 3 p.m. Dr. Polo confirmed me in my statement that the denial
                            of facilities to the <hi rend="italic">Bolognesi</hi> was an absolutely
                            impartial act and was not directed against Peru, to which the President
                            replied that unfortunately it was Perú that had been affected. I told
                            the President that our Government, after the most careful consideration,
                            had felt it should not, with Government facilities, aid even in
                            preparations for war, and that he could be sure our Government would act
                            with the utmost impartiality in every case; that a real friendliness for
                            Peru animated our Government; that we felt the two Governments were
                            friends and good neighbors and that it was traditional with us that
                            Peruvians were among the closest of all the friends of our Country in
                            Latin America. I added that over a long period of years I had never
                            heard the slightest unfriendly expression in the United States regarding
                            Peru. In short, I said everything I properly could to convince the
                            President we are not inimical to Peru, that we are holding the scales
                            even and that there is no partiality for Colombia.</p>
                        <p>In the conversation, however, it came out quite distinctly that the
                            President is now quite hostile in his thoughts about Colombia and is
                            convinced that our Government is more favorable to Colombia than to
                            Peru. I told him I felt sure Colombia had felt as much aggrieved in
                            certain cases as he did about the <hi rend="italic">Bolognesi</hi>, and
                            mentioned our Government’s action with regard to the aviators going to
                            Colombia as set forth in the Instructions above referred to. The
                            President expressed incredulity and was not to be appeased. He referred
                            to the fact that this Embassy is the custodian of the interests of
                            Colombia in this country, whereupon I asked Dr. Polo to assure the
                            President that our functions were carried out with the utmost care for
                            Peruvian susceptibility and that of course they depended upon the
                            complete acquiescence of the Peruvian Government.</p>
                        <p>I told the President that I felt it to be my duty, as I was sure he felt
                            it to be his, to keep the best and friendliest relations between our two
                            Governments, and that I hoped any lingering suspicions he might have as
                            to our Government’s action or my own would be dismissed. The President
                            very graciously concurred in this and the question came up as to the
                            mediation the press reports say Secretary Hull has determined upon in
                            case both Colombia and Perú should request our Government’s good
                            offices. I told the President it would seem to me, from what I had read,
                            that what had occurred had been given too positive a character; that my
                            impression was that correspondents at a Press Conference had made an
                            inquiry of the Secretary and had developed his common sense reply that
                            of course if Perú and Colombia should request the good offices of our
                            Government, whatever might be possible under the circumstances would be
                            done, and that it seemed <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0456"/>hardly
                            likely that there had been any considered intention of offering
                            mediation or that our Government was merely waiting to be asked to offer
                            it.</p>
                        <p>I stressed to the President the fact that our Government is following the
                            policy of the good neighbor, saying we sincerely hoped the countries in
                            this part of the world would be able to work out their own problems in
                            their own ways and within their own resources. The President replied to
                            this by saying that if the worst should happen, he would have to defend
                            his country, but that as always, he is doing everything possible to
                            bring about a peaceful settlement of the country’s international
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>The Department must not get the impression from anything I have said that
                            there was anything disagreeable about the conversation with the
                            President and with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have always
                            welcomed the President’s directness and frankness as it makes it
                            possible to talk to him with equal frankness and to perceive how he
                            really feels. I regret to say that he is undoubtedly more hostile to
                            Colombia than he has been heretofore and that he has been nettled by the
                                <hi rend="italic">Bolognesi</hi> and the aviator matters and finds
                            it difficult to get them out of his system. His army affiliation becomes
                            more apparent and it seems a pity that he has allowed himself to drift
                            back into the attitude of the Sanchez Cerro Government instead of
                            following the policy initiated in the conversations with Alfonso
                                López.<note n="10" xml:id="d488fn10">See <ref

                        <p>The internal situation is difficult and the President is undoubtedly
                            under considerable strain. He has problems of considerable importance to
                            deal with in the direction of Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador and the
                            financial situation is also a difficult one. I trust I have been able to
                            persuade him, in response to his frankness about ourselves, that he is
                            under considerable misconception and that notwithstanding his natural
                            disappointment, he can have no real ground for complaint.</p>
                        <p>As a final remark in closing this despatch, I beg to inform the
                            Department that a decree has just been issued for the construction of a
                            military airport in the vicinity of Lima. A translation of the decree is

                                mechanics<note n="15" xml:id="d490fn15">Not printed.</note> from
                            which, after objection had been made by this Government, certain
                            provisions of the original contract were deleted, notably one actually
                            enlisting the individuals in question in the Colombian armed forces, and
                            another obligating them to fight in time of war.</p>
                        <p>As originally written, this Government was of the opinion that the
                            contracts would violate the spirit, if not the strict letter, of
                            Sections 21, 22 and 25 of Title 18 of the United States Code under the
                            title of “Offenses against Neutrality”, particularly Section 22. The
                            Department refused to issue passports to travel to Colombia to persons
                            signing that contract, and requested the Colombian Minister not to make
                            any further contracts or arrangements with American citizens where under
                            the latter would be required to serve in the armed forces of Colombia,
                                <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0458"/>to recall the existing
                            contracts and to delete from them the clause to this effect.</p>
                        <p>Upon the Colombian Government’s compliance with this Government’s’
                            request, passports were issued to the individuals signing the revised
                            contracts, who departed for Colombia, according to the Department’s
                            information, on April 12, 1934. There is enclosed a photostatic copy of
                            the list of passengers sailing from New York on the SS <hi rend="italic"

                            Americans who have taken service with the Colombian Government inasmuch
                            as this Government understands that further contracts are being signed
                            by the Colombian Government with American citizens who will be
                            proceeding to Colombia in the near future.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires’ you to apprise it of whatever information of
                            interest may come to your attention regarding the activities of any of
                            the American aviators in the service of the Colombian Government. Should
                            any of the Americans under reference enlist in the Colombian armed
                            forces or, in the event of the outbreak of hostilities to which Colombia
                            might be a party, should they participate in such hostilities, this
                            Government would of course have to request the surrender of the
                            passports of the individuals concerned.</p>
                        <p>As the Legation will observe from the enclosed press release dated April
                            11, 1934, Americans holding reserve commissions in our Army or Navy will
                            forfeit them if they enter the military service of a foreign country.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Williams</hi>: I am very pleased that you
                            are undertaking a mission to certain important countries of South
                            America in connection with the problems created by the control of
                            exchange by the Governments of these countries.</p>
                        <p>As you know, this Government is striving to develop trade with the
                            countries of Latin America. These exchange controls are one of the
                            greatest present obstacles to that effort, and are costly to our
                            producers and exporters. Although the trade of these countries has
                            tended to increase recently and the pressure on their exchanges appears
                            to have been easing somewhat, the controls are still in existence and
                            continue to present perplexing difficulties both to American traders and
                            to the Department.</p>
                        <p>The general policy that the Department has endeavored to uphold looks
                            towards the diminution of the controls which impede international trade,
                            and thus to achieve a more satisfactory trade relationship. In the
                            meanwhile, its interest is to lighten the restrictive force of these
                            controls as applied to American trade and to protect American trade
                            against discriminations.</p>
                        <p>This Government has avoided, as far as possible, special arrangements
                            that would increase the administrative regulation of trade and the
                            extension of control over the foreign exchanges; it trusts that the
                            American interest can be properly protected by understandings and
                            agreements which do not involve serious extensions of these controls.
                            The outline of these policies we have presented repeatedly to the Latin
                            American Governments concerned both through the medium of their
                            representatives in Washington and through our own diplomatic
                            missions.</p>
                        <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0461"/>
                        <p>In accordance with the preceding ideas, you are instructed to visit the
                            capitals of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay (and you are also
                            authorized to go to any other points in these countries in the event
                            that it seems advisable in order to carry out the purposes of your
                            visit). In each of these countries the American diplomatic and
                            commercial missions will be instructed to assist you in obtaining the
                            fullest possible understanding of all aspects of the exchange control
                            situation, and to put you in touch with the local governmental
                            authorities who are concerned in this matter. You in turn are instructed
                            upon your arrival in each of these countries to put yourself at the
                            disposition of the head of the mission for the purposes of assisting him
                            in the consideration of the exchange control situations with which he
                            has been dealing and for the purpose also of working out with him the
                            major lines of policy immediately to be pursued by this Government. You
                            will find that these missions have given very considerable thought to
                            the subject and have kept themselves closely advised.</p>
                        <p>The missions have in fact recommended lines of possible agreement to the
                            Department. It may well be that the occasion of your visit will be an
                            auspicious time to formulate and to begin to negotiate with the foreign
                            governmental authorities agreements to govern the treatment of American
                            trade interests. In that event you will kindly give all assistance to
                            the missions in the negotiation of these agreements. Of course, before
                            entering into negotiations with any foreign governmental authorities the
                            American mission will submit the proposed agreements to the Department
                            for approval before in any way committing this Government.</p>
                        <p>I may perhaps summarize very briefly the immediate lines of suggested
                            action which you are likely to discover in the countries you will
                            visit.</p>
                        <p>In Chile the American Ambassador has been in negotiation with the Chilean
                            authorities looking forward to an agreement in accordance with which the
                            foreign exchange that arises out of trade between the United States and
                            Chile will be released from the exchange control. A difficulty has
                            arisen in connection with the rate at which exchange may be made
                            available by the Chilean authorities for the purpose of gradually paying
                            off the commercial and other frozen credits due to Americans. After
                            study of the situation, the Department will welcome receiving, through
                            the American Ambassador, your views on the situation and your
                            recommendations regarding action. It believes there is a possibility
                            that during your visit to Chile the final steps may be prepared towards
                            reaching an agreement with the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>… The Brazilian Government appears to be tending to foster special
                            agreements with other governments in an effort to assure or <pb n="392"
                                xml:id="pg_392" facs="0462"/>secure new markets for its coffee,
                            which agreements may prove to be disadvantageous to American interests.
                            You are instructed to give the fullest possible study and consideration
                            to this whole subject. The American Embassy has submitted a carefully
                            prepared analysis to the Department, of which I believe you have a copy.

                            glad to receive from you, through the American Ambassador, your judgment
                            as to the most advantageous course to pursue. I hope that it may prove
                            possible during your visit in Brazil for the first steps to be taken by
                            the American Embassy, working in cooperation with yourself, towards an
                            agreement with the Brazilian authorities. Again, you will understand
                            that all proposed bases of negotiation with the Brazilian Government
                            should be submitted to the Department for approval.</p>
                        <p>As regards Argentina, a general judgment exists that Argentine exchange
                            arrangements are now distinctly working to curtail American trade. After
                            study of the subject and conferences with the Embassy this Department
                            will be glad to receive, through the Embassy, any recommendations
                            regarding action which in your judgment will serve to protect American
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Upon your return, I would appreciate it if you will report fully to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Donald B. Heath of the Division of Latin American Affairs of the
                            Department has been assigned to you as assistant and is being instructed

                            <p>The exchange problem which it has been our mission to study in
                                Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, is mainly a result of the
                                world depression. Value of exports was greatly reduced by the fall
                                of world prices, and the inflow of foreign capital, which is always
                                a characteristic of young countries in normal times but which was
                                carried to extremes in the twenties, was abruptly cut off.
                                Meanwhile, external public and private debt charges did not
                                diminish, and in most cases merchandise imports decreased less
                                promptly and drastically than did exports. This lack of balance in
                                the international account was made worse, and the prospects for
                                recovery blacker, by the defensive commercial policies pursued by
                                the outside world.</p>
                            <p>In the main, and without minimizing the pre-depression mistakes made
                                by these countries, especially their over-borrowing (for which the
                                lenders were also responsible) or their subsequent mistakes, both in
                                exchange control administration and in general policy, it seems
                                clear that neither the origin of their exchange problem nor its
                                solution is to be found primarily in acts or circumstances over
                                which these countries have the principal control. A satisfactory
                                general solution must depend upon world trade recovery and greater
                                freedom of access to world markets.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime, the chief problem for these countries is to
                                endeavor, so far as it lies within their power, to work toward a
                                position of international equilibrium. Thus far, whether
                                deliberately or by <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0464"/>force of
                                circumstances, they have tried three methods of achieving this
                                result. The large gold outflows of 1929 and 1930 were of no avail
                                because in a world where prices in <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                                countries are falling sharply, as in the opposite case (such as war)
                                where all prices are rising sharply, gold flow is a futile means of
                                correcting an adverse balance of payments.</p>
                            <p>Depreciation of the currency, such as followed cessation of gold
                                exports, also proved ineffective, largely by reason of the fact that
                                this method also assumes for its success relatively stable (at
                                least, not sharply falling) prices in the outside world, coupled
                                with willingness and ability of foreign markets to buy. In a world
                                of falling prices, of trade reduced to a minimum by high duties,
                                quotas and other defensive measures, a world, moreover, in which
                                currency depreciation was becoming the rule rather than the
                                exception, no single country could hope for much immediate trade
                                benefit by reason of its own currency depreciation.</p>
                            <p>Not only was further currency depreciation futile, under such
                                circumstances, but it even came to be regarded as a positive evil,
                                threatening on the one hand to produce an uncontrollable internal
                                inflation which by raising domestic prices and costs would still
                                further impair capacity to export, and on the other hand, to produce
                                such a chaotic condition of the foreign exchange markets as to
                                injure trade still further. There is another circumstance which
                                appears to have played an important part in Latin American policy in
                                establishing exchange control. Agricultural products are subject to
                                inelastic demand conditions, and if the exporting country supplies
                                an important fraction of the total coming upon the market, as is
                                true of all these countries, any considerable stimulation of exports
                                through exchange depreciation may itself contribute to break prices
                                still further.</p>
                            <p>That considerations of the kind which have been cited have been much
                                in the minds of those responsible for Latin American exchange policy
                                has been abundantly illustrated during our trip. For example, Sr.
                                Arteaga, Uruguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs, stressed the
                                futility of permitting further gold export until trade and price
                                equilibrium is assured. Dr. Souza Dantas, the Director of Exchange
                                in Brazil, said he could not risk a premature relaxation of exchange
                                control, because any sudden or large depreciation of the milreis
                                would break the price of coffee. Dr. Pinedo, Argentine Finance
                                Minister, said that the whole basis of the Argentine policy had been
                                to prevent the external depreciation of the peso from becoming
                                internal as well, and both he and Sr. Duhau, Minister of
                                Agriculture, stressed the fact that the Argentine wheat producer can
                                now cover his costs with wheat at 4.50 pesos, whereas in 1929, 7
                                pesos was a no-profit price; <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0465"
                                />in consequence, Argentina does not need a complete recovery of
                                world wheat prices in order to recover her export trade position in
                                that product. Likewise, Sr. Ross, Chilean Finance Minister, stated
                                that his policy is based upon maintaining for as long as possible
                                the present gap between the external and internal depreciation of
                                the peso, a gap which was at one time threatened by the internal
                                currency inflation which followed in the wake of the violent
                                external depreciation of the Chilean peso, but which he believes can
                                now be maintained for a considerable period so long as the present
                                depreciated peso is held stable in the exchange market.</p>
                            <p>The third method attempted for working toward a position of
                                international equilibrium has been that of exchange control.
                                Whatever may be said in criticism of this method and of the manner
                                in which it has been operated, it is important to note at the outset
                                that it was not established until the summer of 1931, when the
                                depression was nearly two years old, that it was not resorted to
                                until both gold export and currency depreciation had been tried, and
                                that it was then resorted to not by one or two countries but by
                                virtually all of the South American countries, acting independently
                                of each other.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of exchange control, rightly conceived, is to establish
                                an official fixed rate of exchange, and to so ration the supply of
                                exchange created by the exports as to establish at this fixed rate a
                                balance between the country’s incoming and outgoing payments. The
                                method of control may be merely a system of supervision by the
                                government or the central bank, of the exchange operations conducted
                                by the commercial banks; or, if this method proves ineffective, the
                                central bank or the government may actually take over the purchase
                                and sale of the exchange. Most of the South American governments
                                have gone through one or both of these phases of exchange
                                control.</p>
                            <p>In all cases except Argentina, this attempt to produce a balance by
                                rationing exchange at a fixed rate has involved either a complete
                                default on the public external debt or some composition resulting in
                                only partial debt service; and in all cases curtailment of private
                                debt service and other non-commercial remittances has been involved.
                                Undoubtedly, one important reason in some countries for the
                                establishment of exchange control, besides those already mentioned,
                                was the necessity for assuring to the government an adequate supply
                                of exchange for debt service at a fixed (and not too high) rate
                                which could be definitely budgeted for from year to year.</p>
                            <p>As we have heard it described repeatedly during our travels on this
                                mission, the problem confronting this system of rationing exchange
                                at an official rate is one of “not enough exchange to go around,” so
                                that the distribution unavoidably raises many difficult questions of

                                trouble has been an insufficient surplus of exports over imports, it
                                is not surprising that foreign exporters, as well as the foreign
                                investors, should find themselves confronted, and their exports
                                impeded, by this same condition. Either exchange has not been
                                available at all, or a lag has developed as the importing country
                                has found itself forced to draw upon its future supply of exchange
                                in order to pay for past or current imports which, under the
                                conditions, probably should not have been allowed to enter.</p>
                            <p>In this way, there has developed the problem of blocked or lagging
                                balances, in addition to the continuing difficulties and
                                uncertainties with respect to remittances on current trade account.
                                A series of blocked funds agreements in 1932 and 1933, in Brazil,
                                Argentina, and Uruguay partially cleared up these arrears and
                                provided a means of spreading the payment over a period of years;
                                but since that time some new accumulations have appeared in these
                                countries. In Chile, no blocked funds agreements have been made
                                except as part of its system of compensation treaties. (But see
                                below, Report on Chile.<note n="5" xml:id="d494fn5"><hi

                            <p>How these blocked balances should and can be cleared up has been one
                                of the chief concerns of our investigation. The problem raises
                                difficult questions as to equitable treatment of our commercial
                                interests, many of whom have already consented to postponements
                                under the earlier agreements. And on broader grounds, it should be
                                recognized that until these arrears are disposed of and definite
                                evidence is forthcoming that new accumulations are not piling up,
                                there can be no general, satisfactory solution of the South American
                                exchange problem. It was the failure to provide exchange to cover
                                these lagging balances which was in large part responsible for the
                                development of bootleg exchange markets, the appearance of which
                                always constitutes a threat to the effective operation of the
                                exchange control, and provides evidence that the system is not
                                functioning successfully.</p>

                            <p>Confronted with these conditions arising out of “not enough exchange
                                to go round,” countries having commercial or financial interests in
                                these Latin American countries have to consider two alternative
                                lines of policy. If the country’s trade position is strong, in that
                                it buys more from the South American country than it sells, it is in
                                a position, without waiting for any general solution of the latter
                                country’s exchange difficulties, to force a special agreement
                                whereby it is assured that the exchange which it creates shall be
                                used to cover its own export and other exchange requirements. This
                                is the policy which Great Britain has pursued with Argentina under
                                the Roca <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0467"/>Agreement.<note

                                basis also underlies the system of compensation treaties which many
                                of the Continental European countries have made with Chile. And
                                there is evidence, more recently, that Great Britain has been
                                considering a similar arrangement with Uruguay. The second
                                alternative is to await, and insofar as possible to assist in
                                facilitating, a general solution which will clear up the South
                                American country’s exchange difficulties as a whole. This is the
                                policy which the United States has thus far pursued with all these
                                countries, notwithstanding the fact that in two of them, Brazil and
                                Chile, its trade position is strong.</p>
                            <p>One of the chief objects of our mission, therefore, has been to
                                attempt to form a judgment, after first-hand investigation on the
                                ground, as to whether, and under what conditions, the continuance of
                                our past policy is justified, or whether, in view of all the
                                circumstances, we must now adopt, where possible, the policy of
                                special agreements in order to assure to ourselves an adequate
                                supply of exchange cover. In the countries where our trade position
                                is not strong, and where therefore such a solution is in any case
                                impossible, the question has been whether it is possible by other
                                means to secure more satisfactory treatment than that accorded to us
                                in the past. In the separate reports which follow upon the
                                individual countries I have endeavored to state my views as to the
                                correct policy to be followed in each case, or the principal facts
                                and considerations bearing upon the alternative lines of policy
                                which are open to us. It will be sufficient in this introductory
                                memorandum to set forth some general considerations.</p>
                            <p>Our past policy has been based upon recognition of the broad fact
                                that special exchange agreements have the effect of canalizing
                                trade, putting it in a strait-jacket, and doing away with those
                                triangular trade relations which are essential if nations are to
                                enjoy any degree of freedom to buy or sell particular products to
                                best advantage. Since it is the foreign exchange mechanism which
                                makes possible such multi-country relations, all devices for locking
                                up exchange within the confines of particular trade channels through
                                the exercise of pressure based on the strength of particular trade
                                balance positions, has the effect of severely restricting world
                                trade as a whole. They have, in fact, a far greater degree of
                                restrictive effect than have protective tariffs. It has been the
                                pursuit of such practices by some of the leading nations which has
                                intensified and prolonged the greatest contraction of international
                                trade that the world has ever seen.</p>
                            <p>As a corollary of this general truth, it should be recognized that
                                this canalization of trade through exchange compensation or clearing
                                agreements comes into direct conflict with the requirements of any
                                    <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0468"/>general solution of the
                                exchange-control country’s difficulties, since it deprives that
                                country of power to reduce its total imports in accordance with some
                                criterion of necessity or desirability and thus to achieve a
                                position of international balance best suited to its present
                                requirements and future growth. Instead of the exchange being
                                rationed on the basis of the country’s needs and capacity for
                                payment and transfer, it is allocated on the basis of countries, in
                                accordance with the amount of pressure their trade position enables
                                them to apply, with the result that the exchange-control country has
                                no means of curtailing imports from countries with whom its trade is
                                thus artificially canalized, even though such imports be
                                non-necessities and luxuries; and may find itself forced in
                                consequence to seek needed imports from other countries, even though
                                it can now offer them even less satisfactory exchange arrangements
                                than would otherwise have been the case. The difficulty of
                                achieving, under these circumstances, any general solution of the
                                exchange problem hardly requires further elaboration.</p>
                            <p>Recognizing the force of such broad considerations as these, which
                                have heretofore formed the basis of our policy, it can be argued,
                                nevertheless, that such a policy may not be tenable indefinitely in
                                a world which to an increasing degree is resorting to trade
                                canalization and special exchange agreements, and that we may
                                therefore be justified in taking (or even forced to take) similar
                                action. Especially can this view be argued wherever, notwithstanding
                                our strong trade position, we have any clear reason to think that we
                                are not being accorded treatment at least equal to that accorded
                                other nationals, and are thus being penalized for our failure to
                                pursue the more direct and selfish policy. This question has been
                                raised in the State Department with respect to both Brazil and
                                Chile, and it has been one of the chief assignments of this mission
                                to investigate the facts in both these cases and to endeavor to
                                arrive at a judgment with respect to our future policy. The question
                                in Chile relates now only to the treatment of blocked balances,
                                which is analyzed in some detail in our report on Chile. The
                                question in Brazil is much broader, and relates as well to treatment
                                on current trade. We have endeavored to satisfy ourselves as to
                                whether any deliberate policy of according to us less than equitable
                                treatment exists in any of the countries visited, and the basis for
                                such treatment; and in particular in the case of Brazil we have
                                sought to investigate the various rumors and differences of
                                statement as to special transactions representing for us less than
                                fair and equitable treatment compared with other nationals.</p>
                            <p>In dealing with questions of discrimination it is necessary to
                                distinguish between a general restriction of imports, or other
                                transactions requiring remittance, such as the discrimination in
                                favor of necessities <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0469"/>and
                                against luxuries, and discrimination as between different nationals
                                exporting the same class of product. Much of the post-war expansion
                                of our Latin American export trade occurred in commodities which
                                under present conditions cannot be regarded as necessities, and
                                indeed some of them were bought only because our banks and investors
                                were mistakenly liberal in providing capital which created in these
                                countries a false atmosphere of high prosperity. Although individual
                                importers may now oppose and even resent curtailment of their
                                market, there may well be a valid basis for this kind of
                                restriction. In all the countries, the government officials have
                                complained to us that any relaxation of exchange restrictions is
                                seized upon by the importers as an opportunity for increasing their
                                importations. It therefore seems probable that even after exchange
                                control is lifted there may continue to be some system of import
                                licensing. How soon all such restrictions could be removed would
                                depend upon the conditions affecting these countries’ balances of
                                payment, including particularly the recovery of their export
                                trade.</p>
                            <p rend="center">III</p>
                            <p>A major consideration, therefore, in attempting to decide as between
                                these alternative lines of policy, is the prospect for general trade
                                recovery in the South American countries. Having pursued thus far
                                the broader policy calculated to assist world trade recovery, and
                                having now in contemplation, as well, the policy of reciprocal trade
                                agreements as a means of moderating tariffs and other obstacles to
                                international trade, there would appear to be a presumption in favor
                                of continuing upon our present course, if there is a nearby prospect
                                of better trade and exchange conditions.</p>
                            <p>We have therefore sought especially to investigate, in each country
                                visited, the present economic situation and the immediate trade
                                outlook. It seems clear that during the present year there has
                                occurred in each of the countries a fairly substantial improvement
                                traceable primarily to a rise in world prices for its exports, and
                                that as this improvement has taken place there has been some
                                betterment of exchange conditions. If the present trend continues,
                                it would seem reasonable to look forward to the achievement of a
                                general solution of the foreign exchange problems.</p>
                            <p>This solution should take the form of a gradual lifting of exchange
                                control, in favor of a free market. Though exchange control may have
                                been necessary under the chaotic conditions of 1931, particularly in
                                the face of a continuing fall in world prices, it is an artificial
                                stop-gap device which is unlikely to provide any general or
                                permanent cure for exchange disequilibrium. To prevent illicit
                                dealings the governments have been forced to permit some operations
                                in the free market, and in all the countries there has thus
                                developed a complicated system of <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400"
                                    facs="0470"/>exchange, partially “controlled” and partially
                                “free,” with frequently several gradations in between. This dual
                                system now provides a means whereby the official control can
                                gradually be reduced and a larger and larger portion of the exchange
                                offered for sale in the free market.</p>
                            <p>That practically all of the governments visited recognize this
                                procedure to be the final solution of their exchange difficulties
                                has been indicated in our conversations with them. For example,
                                Souza Dantas in Brazil hopes to lift the control entirely within a
                                year, by placing a percentage of the coffee bills each month in the
                                free market. In Argentina, Pinedo, the Finance Minister, stated that
                                he regarded free exchange as the only sound system, and Gagneux,
                                Exchange Control Director, explained that their present system,
                                adopted last November, was designed expressly to permit a ready
                                transfer to a free market system, as trade conditions warrant. The
                                same policy is apparent in the new exchange decree announced during
                                our visit in Uruguay. The only exception is Chile, where the Finance
                                Minister clearly intends to retain the control; but even there, the
                                purpose is to prevent appreciation of the peso rather than to
                                restrict trade. Chile’s policy will be, apparently, to use surplus
                                exchange obtained under the present system to clear up blocked
                                balances and then to begin service on the foreign debt.</p>
                            <p>While the present trend thus appears to be toward trade and exchange
                                betterment, it is not possible to estimate, in any more precise
                                fashion, the probable course of events. But again it must be
                                recognized that one factor working against the lifting of exchange
                                control is the policy pursued by foreign governments in restricting
                                their markets and insisting upon canalization of trade by
                                compensation agreements and other devices. Any success which our
                                government might have in inducing the European governments to
                                renounce these practices would accomplish much for the general
                                solution of the exchange problem. We have also to recognize that any
                                similar action on our part, resulting in the extension of this
                                restrictive system, would tend to postpone a general solution;
                                whereas anything that our country can do to improve the balance of
                                payments of these countries, whether by trade agreement, financing
                                of blocked balances, debt conversion and adjustments, or in any
                                other way will ameliorate not only their position but our own. At
                                the same time, there is no reason why our government should submit
                                to treatment which bears evidence of any deliberate policy of
                                hostility or discrimination toward our commercial or financial
                                interests, whether from the South American countries themselves or
                                from the European countries which have interests there.</p>

                            <p>During our stay in Rio de Janeiro, July 13–23, we devoted ourselves
                                to two main tasks: (1) a detailed investigation of the technical
                                operation of the Brazilian exchange control, for which the
                                Controller, Dr. Souza Dantas, gave us every facility; and (2)
                                discussion with our own governmental representatives, the Brazilian
                                officials, and the American Chamber of Commerce, of possible
                                solutions of our exchange difficulties in Brazil.</p>
                            <p>On the latter problem we discussed two main types of solution, a
                                general solution which would promise betterment for ourselves
                                equally with others, and a special solution which would assure to
                                our nationals more adequate and prompt exchange cover without
                                waiting for Brazilian exchange difficulties as a whole to clear up.
                                We have also tried to ascertain whether we are now receiving
                                treatment which is fair and equal to that being afforded other
                                nationals, or whether Brazil has been entering into special
                                arrangements with other governments or their nationals (see Appendix
                                1) which might justify or compel us in our turn to seek some special
                                arrangement designed to protect our interests and assure us
                                treatment at least as good as that accorded to others.</p>

                            <p>Our visit to Brazil came after a long period of study and discussions
                                carried on by our government representatives and by the American
                                Chamber of Commerce in Rio with the Brazilian officials. The
                                Ambassador’s report on the situation, dated May 31, 1934,<note n="7"
                                    xml:id="d494fn7">Not printed.</note> reviews the history of the
                                problem, recites his failure to find proof of discrimination against
                                us in his investigation of various rumors and complaints concerning
                                special arrangements with other nationals, and concludes with
                                discussion of four possible alternatives for improving the exchange
                                treatment accorded to our exporters and other American interests
                                requiring remittance from Brazil. Three of these alternatives deal
                                with different possible methods of obtaining a sufficient percentage
                                of the dollar exchange arising out of Brazilian exports to the
                                United States to cover our exchange requirements. The fourth
                                alternative discussed in the report is the granting of an American
                                credit to Brazil.</p>
                            <p>A prolonged meeting which I held with the American Chamber of
                                Commerce on Monday, July 16, made it clear that the Chamber is
                                unanimous in the view that we should not wait for a general solution
                                of the Brazilian exchange problem but should make some special
                                agreement whereby a percentage adequate for our requirements would
                                be allocated out of the dollar drafts created by Brazilian exports
                                to <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0472"/>the United States. The
                                members emphasized the strength of our trade position, called
                                attention to the fact that we have not shared in the increase of
                                Brazilian imports which has occurred in the past year, complained of
                                special arrangements made by Brazil with other nationals involving
                                discrimination against ourselves, and referred to the fact that
                                under the exchange control as now operated the Brazilian Government
                                can take exchange not only for debt service but for extraordinary
                                military or other foreign expenditure, or in order to repatriate
                                bonds, to the detriment both of our current exchange requirements
                                and of payments on account of blocked funds. In these circumstances,
                                since we have no means of controlling the Brazilian situation as a
                                whole, the Chamber strongly favors the special solution already
                                mentioned, and states that the Brazilian Government, aware of the
                                strength of our position and the reasonableness of our claims, would
                                promptly consent to such an arrangement if our State Department
                                should request it. … Attached to this report is a memorandum by the
                                Chamber of conversations between it and Dr. Oswaldo Aranha, the
                                Finance Minister, in thirteen meetings held between May 28 and July
                                9. (See Appendix 4.)</p>
                            <p>On Tuesday, July 17, Dr. Aranha and Dr. Souza Dantas made to us a
                                definite proposal for a compensation or clearing arrangement between
                                the Banco do Brasil and a committee to represent the New York banks,
                                whereby dollars would be paid out promptly in New York as milreis
                                are deposited on account of imports and other debit items in Brazil,
                                balances of dollars remaining unrequired at the end of each month to
                                be available to Brazil for meeting her requirements in other
                                countries; this arrangement to be accompanied by a credit extended
                                to the Bank of Brazil by the Export-Import Bank, or by a group of
                                New York banks, to be used for immediate liquidation of all American
                                blocked balances accumulated since June, 1933; this loan to be
                                amortized annually and the amortization requirements to be included
                                in the clearing arrangement.</p>
                            <p>This proposal, which we did not in any way invite, was obviously
                                prepared in advance of our arrival. Dr. Aranha has promised to give
                                us a copy of it in writing (See Appendix 3, Title 1.); but he has
                                also made it clear that he wishes to reserve it for discussion with
                                the Department upon his arrival in Washington as Ambassador. The
                                Minister has further asked that it be kept confidential, apart from
                                communication to the Ambassador.</p>

                            <p>The solutions thus far discussed are special arrangements between
                                ourselves and Brazil which rest on the strength of our trade

                                a more general solution, the purpose of which would be to secure a
                                general equilibrium in the Brazilian balance of payments which would
                                permit a lifting of the exchange control. Such a solution would
                                require: <list>

                            <p>The policy would require also the formulation of a definite series of
                                steps for the relaxation of control and should be accompanied at all
                                stages by a definite reporting system on all exchange transactions
                                which would enable the Controller to know precisely his position in
                                order to prevent transactions which might upset the exchange market
                                and defeat the purpose.</p>
                            <p>From our study of the statistics prior to our arrival and from our
                                investigations here, we believe that the Brazilian situation is
                                turning for the better. Coffee prices have held higher since last
                                November and the balance of trade during the first five months of
                                the year has been definitely more favorable than a year ago. The
                                estimated balance of payments for 1934, prepared by Corliss, shows a
                                net debit for the year of only $15,500,000, notwithstanding the fact
                                that he uses in his estimate the relatively small export balance of
                                1933. Both Dr. Souza Dantas and Dr. Aranha estimate that with the
                                present reduced debt service and this year’s more favorable export

                                it not for the pressure of arrearages previously accumulated. The
                                Chamber of Commerce memorandum, already referred to, contains the
                                statement that, “There is now a noticeable betterment in the time
                                elapsed from date of shipment of merchandise to date of receipt of
                                exchange contract.” This statement was both affirmed and denied
                                during our meeting with the Chamber, but we have the distinct
                                impression that on the whole the lag in payment is diminishing and
                                the amount of exchange available is increasing.</p>
                            <p>A further favorable factor undoubtedly is the appointment, last
                                March, of Dr. Souza Dantas as the new Exchange Controller. … It is
                                noteworthy that the American community, despite many complaints,
                                offered not a single unfavorable comment on Dr. Souza Dantas. He
                                impressed us very favorably, and we are confident that if he is
                                given a reasonably free hand he will progressively improve the
                                exchange control administration. He has stated to us that his
                                purpose is gradually to reduce the “official” market in favor of the
                                “free” <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0474"/>and “grey” markets,
                                and has promised us a memorandum setting forth the steps to be
                                pursued in this process. (See Appendix 3, Title 2.) He estimates
                                that under favorable circumstances he may be able to achieve his
                                objective within a year. He thinks the essentials to the success of
                                his plan are: <list>

                                        credits accumulated since June, 1933. (Neither the Chamber
                                        of Commerce nor the Exchange Controller has a statistical
                                        compilation of the amount of these credits. We have
                                        estimates from the Chamber of $12,000,000, $15,000,000 and
                                        $18,000,000 and Dr. Souza Dantas’ estimate is $20,000,000,
                                        for American funds alone.) Dr. Souza Dantas says that the
                                        present number of creditors is much more numerous and the
                                        individual amounts smaller than in the case of the blocked
                                        funds agreement of June, 1933; and apparently chiefly for
                                        this reason he favors the arrangement of an American bank

                                        in the milreis would break the price of coffee, but he feels
                                        that a carefully conceived plan whereby percentages of the
                                        coffee bills (say 10% a month) were taken out of the
                                        “official” market and put into the “grey” or “free” market
                                        would have no such ill effect on coffee prices.</item>

                                        over imports. He has recently drawn up and put into effect a
                                        classification of documentary imports in three groups, in
                                        the order of necessity (See Appendix 2, page 6). As now
                                        operated the exchange control takes over a percentage of
                                        exchange for Government requirements (debt service, et
                                        cetera); the remainder is distributed among the imports in
                                        the following percentages: 50% of exchange to the first
                                        group, 30% to the second and 20% to the third. Exchange
                                        applications are given a chronological number in the
                                        category to which the import corresponds. The remaining
                                        percentages of exchange must be acquired in the “grey” or
                                        the “free” market. The plan evidently is not to deny
                                        exchange to any importer but to force an increasing amount
                                        of imports into the “grey” and “free” markets and at the
                                        same time to place increasing amounts of exchange, arising
                                        out of the exports, in these markets. Since many American
                                        products come in the last class of imports (non-necessitous
                                        and luxury products), the policy will probably not be
                                        popular with some of the American exporters; but there is an
                                        offset in the fact that though the price of exchange is
                                        higher in these other markets than the “official” rate, the
                                        exchange cover will, if the plan succeeds, be more promptly
                                        available. It should be noted too that many American exports
                                        come in the first class of Brazilian imports.</item>

                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">III. Conclusion</hi>.</p>
                            <p>It is apparent from this summary that our Government has a choice of
                                two alternative lines of policy with respect to the Brazilian
                                exchange problem. Though Dr. Aranha appears to wish to reserve the
                                subject for discussion with the Department upon his arrival as Ambas
                                    <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0475"/>sador, Brazil is
                                evidently prepared to accept and even to suggest to us an arrangment
                                for allocating an adequate percentage of our dollar drafts to cover
                                our Brazilian exchange requirements. Dr. Aranha further wishes to
                                arrange a credit to be used to liquidate the new blocked funds which
                                have accumulated since June, 1933. It seems to me entirely possible,
                                however, that the Department could, if it wished, obtain assent to
                                the first half of this proposal without assenting to the second,
                                provided some other disposition were made of the blocked funds
                                accumulation. The Chamber of Commerce states that it would be
                                interested in a plan for paying off the blocked funds provided the
                                period did not exceed two years; it is not interested in a new six
                                year plan. The advantage of this solution, from our point of view,
                                is that it gives us assurance of prompt and adequate exchange cover
                                provided out of Brazil’s own exports to us. The disadvantage is that
                                it bears a resemblance to the Boca Agreement and the general
                                European exchange clearing and compensation agreements to which the
                                Department’s policy has heretofore been opposed. My understanding
                                is, for example, that the Department was offered such an arrangement
                                by the Chilean Government and refused it on grounds of general
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>The proposal for a credit advance is unsound on the broad ground that
                                Brazil’s present exchange difficulties are in part due to previous
                                overborrowing, as evidenced particularly by the fact that Brazil has
                                had to make two debt compositions during the depression, which have
                                reduced her service charges on public debt by 60%, in contrast with
                                Argentina, who has maintained her debt service intact. While this
                                debt situation continues to exist it does not seem prudent for
                                Brazil to accumulate still further debt … On the other hand, it
                                would seem desirable to find some method of cleaning up the new
                                blocked funds accumulations, in order to provide a sound basis for
                                the gradual relaxation of exchange control on current business.</p>
                            <p>As against these special solutions, our Government might pursue a
                                policy with Brazil looking toward a more general solution of the
                                Brazilian exchange problem along the lines already indicated. With
                                favorable conditions such as now appear to be in prospect it seems
                                quite possible that within a year the control might be removed and
                                our exchange requirements supplied under the conditions of a free
                                market. This is the result that seems now to be working out in Chile
                                and in Argentina.</p>
                            <p>Should we follow this course, it would seem wise and reasonable,
                                however, to take an active part in Brazilian exchange control policy
                                insofar as our interests are concerned. For example, we would appear
                                to have a right to protest against extraordinary Government
                                expenditures, repatriation of Brazilian bonds, discrimination in
                                favor of other <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0476"/>nationals,
                                or any other disposition of exchange which would impair the position
                                of American creditors or exporters, many of whom have already
                                consented to wait for payment of blocked funds as well as to a
                                reduction of interest on the public external debt. We could also
                                make definite suggestions to Brazil as to the technical operation of
                                her exchange control (See Appendix 2.). At present the control
                                machinery does not provide, so far as we can find, any statistical
                                record of the balance of payments position, although such a record
                                should be the most obvious by-product of exchange control, and is
                                indispensable both for an efficient control policy and for a program
                                of gradual relaxation of exchange control.</p>
                            <p>The Department might consider whether it should not make direct
                                representations to the Brazilian Government upon both of these
                                points. It might take the position, for example, that for a definite
                                limited period, it will not press for a special allocation of
                                exchange to meet its requirements, notwithstanding its strong trade
                                position, provided: <list>

                            <p>During our stay in Buenos Aires, July 29–August 4, we interviewed
                                various Argentine officials, including especially Dr. Pinedo,
                                Finance Minister, Dr. Duhau, Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Prebisch,
                                the economic and financial advisor of the Government, and Dr.
                                Gagneux, the Exchange Controller. We had a meeting with the American
                                Chamber of Commerce; another with the Exchange Committee of the same
                                organization, and individual meetings with American importers and
                                bankers; and discussed our problems with the American Government
                                representatives.</p>
                            <p>Under the Exchange Control system now in force, Argentina allocates
                                to us more than twice as much exchange as is created by our imports.
                                But since the greater part is required for debt service, we received
                                only about half enough official exchange to cover our exports to
                                Argentina. To put it another way, Argentina allocates to us as cover
                                for our exports about as much official exchange as is created by her
                                exports to us, and in addition supplies official exchange for dollar

                                    xml:id="d494fn10">It should be noted, however, that about half
                                    the dollar bonds are now held in Great Britain. [Footnote in the
                                    original.]</note>; but this means that for about half of our
                                exports to Argentina we must have recourse to the “free market” at a
                                premium over the official rate, which has recently been around 15
                                percent. In allocating the exchange, Argentina discriminates as
                                between imports from us which she regards as more essential and
                                imports which she regards as less essential. It seems clear also,
                                though on this we have had no definite admission, that as between
                                similar imports from different countries, she discriminates in favor
                                of countries, notably England, with which she has concluded special
                                exchange agreements. But it was stated at the meeting with the
                                Exchange Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce that the
                                range of such products is not great. The method of discrimination as
                                between different imports from us is the requirement of a prior
                                exchange permit, imports receiving such a permit being entitled to
                                official exchange and those not receiving such a permit being forced
                                for cover into the free market. Action on the application for permit
                                can and should be had before the import leaves the country of
                                origin, unless the importer is prepared to provide the exchange
                                cover through the free market.</p>
                            <p>Our current exchange position could be improved by inducing Argentina
                                to provide more official exchange or by the removal, or narrowing,
                                of the spread between the official and the free market rates. We
                                have, in addition, the problem of how to release unpaid
                                balances.</p>
                            <p>Means of inducing Argentina to allocate to us more official exchange
                                seem unpromising. We have not the trade position to press for, or to
                                benefit by, a compensation agreement, like the Boca Agreement, and
                                have not favored such a policy even in countries in which our trade
                                position is strong. We could create more dollar exchange by a
                                bilateral trade agreement, but shall probably not wish to do so in
                                the near future. An advance of capital or credit would create more
                                dollar exchange, but we have seen no evidence that Argentina wishes
                                to borrow or the United States to lend; and except possibly in
                                connection with freeing blocked funds (discussed below), which would
                                provide no additional current exchange, there does not appear to be
                                any sound reason, on either side, for recommending this type of
                                solution.</p>
                            <p>Termination of the special exchange agreements with other countries
                                would also help our position, though the Boca Agreement probably
                                impairs our position less than one might in principle assume; but
                                the Argentine officials state frankly that they have responded
                                unavoidably to pressure in making these agreements, and emphasize
                                the fact that the agreements are terminable upon the termination of
                                exchange control. We have received the impression that they have
                                little enthusiasm for the Boca Agreement but see no way out of it at
                                present. <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0478"/>They also appear
                                to feel, somewhat resentfully, that these agreements have not given
                                them the assurance of their foreign market for beef which they
                                expected. It would appear, however, to be both impolitic and futile
                                to raise any questions respecting these agreements with Argentina,
                                though it does appear that the United States has good ground, in
                                logic at least, for pointing out to Great Britain the
                                inconsistencies of her policy as between countries like Brazil in
                                which her trade position is weak and countries like Argentina in
                                which her trade position is strong, the policy being, as it now
                                seems to us, to plead in the former countries for avoidance of
                                compensation agreements, on broad economic grounds, and to press for
                                such agreements in the latter, on narrower grounds of special
                                advantage.</p>
                            <p>The remaining method of solution of our exchange problem lies in the
                                achievement of equilibrium in the Argentine balance of payments,
                                such as would permit the removal of exchange control and the
                                emergence of a single exchange rate, equally applicable to all
                                exporting countries, in a free market. The members of the Exchange
                                Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce expressed themselves
                                in favor of this solution, as both the most feasible and the most
                                desirable. Whether, and when, this solution can be achieved depends
                                upon a number of factors. The chief is world prices of Argentine
                                exports, which have in recent months advanced substantially,
                                materially improving the trade balance and giving rise to a
                                distinctly optimistic atmosphere. This improvement has been
                                accompanied by a narrowing of the spread in the exchange rates in
                                the past two months, which appears to mean that more exchange is
                                becoming available in the free market.<note n="†" xml:id="d494fn11"

                                resulted in a substantial fall in farm costs, Argentina is in a very
                                strong position to take advantage of any improvement in world prices
                                for her products, and does not require a return of prices to the
                                pre-depression level. This matter of internal prices and costs in
                                relation to external we have investigated in some detail, and have
                                discussed with the Minister of Agriculture and with Dr.
                                Prebisch.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Government is also endeavoring to improve its balance
                                of payments position by applying a priority list on imports and by
                                effecting conversions of its foreign debt at a lower rate of
                                interest. It is in a strong position to achieve the latter, as
                                security markets strengthen, owing to its record of maintaining the
                                full debt service during the depression. Two British loans have
                                already been converted, and discussions are now proceeding with
                                respect to others. The Argentine officials have not omitted pointing
                                out to us that a conversion of their six percent dollar bonds into
                                five percents would <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0479"/>help
                                their position considerably, but it will probably be some time
                                before such an operation in our market could be successful.</p>
                            <p>The Argentines have also stated that under a system of free exchange
                                they might not think it prudent to relax at once their system of
                                import permits since there appears to be a strong tendency for
                                imports to increase when control is relaxed or exchange conditions
                                improve; they would have to be guided by actual experience.</p>
                            <p>One possible obstacle to an early removal of exchange control may be
                                the fact that at present the Government makes a substantial profit
                                in the official market by buying the exchange created by the
                                exporters at a considerably lower rate than that at which it is
                                auctioned off to importers having prior exchange permits. This
                                profit has been used in part to buy grains from the farmers at an
                                official minimum price. The Minister of Agriculture has informed me
                                that the Government has now sold all its grain holdings and realized
                                a substantial profit, but he took obvious pride in explaining how
                                the spread in the exchange rates provided funds to finance such
                                operations, and outlined a policy of building up reserves of this
                                character to aid in supporting any agricultural production which
                                might experience temporary market weakness. So long as these
                                operations persist, they may provide a strong motive for retaining
                                the present system of exchange control; but this possibility must be
                                weighed against the counter-possibility that the producers, once
                                they feel their foreign market is assured, may demand that the full
                                price of the exchange, as in a free market, should come to them.
                                This is the development which in Uruguay resulted (July 28) in a new
                                exchange policy considerably enlarging the free market.</p>
                            <p>On the whole, I have received the impression that the Argentine
                                situation is substantially improving, and that if the improvement
                                continues it will result in a narrowing of the spread of exchange
                                rates, the expansion of the free market, and eventually the removal
                                of exchange control. How quickly this will occur cannot be
                                estimated. One recent piece of evidence was the removal (August 1)
                                of exchange control on small private (mainly immigrant) remittances,
                                estimated at about 40,000,000 pesos a year, and the transfer of
                                these operations to the free market. Another may be Dr. Gagneux’s
                                statement to us that the present exchange control mechanism,
                                established last November, was designed to permit an easy and rapid
                                transition to a free market when and as conditions permit. Apart
                                from such straws as these, the Argentine officials have carefully
                                avoided making any definite statements or commitments respecting
                                their future policy.<note n="‡" xml:id="d494fn12">Dr. Pinedo,
                                    Finance Minister, said that he considered the free market,
                                    accompanied by exchange stabilization through gold flow, the
                                    only sound system; but he also stated that he does not intend to
                                    stabilize until he is certain of what other countries,
                                    especially Great Britain and the United States intend to do.

                            <p>Two remaining questions are the attitude of the American business
                                community in Buenos Aires, and the problem of blocked funds. We have
                                the impression that American export interests and bankers in this
                                market feel that the treatment being accorded them is as
                                satisfactory under the circumstances as can reasonably be expected.
                                In their view the system of prior exchange permits combined with
                                freedom of access to the free market after notice is served that
                                permits will not be granted is acceptable until such time as
                                conditions permit the removal of exchange control. Thus far, the
                                Chamber of Commerce Exchange Committee has supplied us with no
                                complaints of discrimination or citations of cases of unfair
                                treatment, and on the other hand several of its members have stated
                                expressly that we are being accorded fair and reasonable treatment,
                                all things considered. On the other hand, they point out that the
                                exchange control has undoubtedly been injurious to many of our small
                                exporters, and that the present comparative absence of complaint is
                                in part due to the fact that only the fittest now survive.<note
                                    n="§" xml:id="d494fn13">These views were expressed at our first
                                    meeting, which was with the Chamber’s Exchange Committee. At the
                                    second, and much larger, meeting with the Chamber as a whole,
                                    individual complaints were expressed. These appeared to come
                                    mainly from the representatives of the smaller exporters.

                            <p>In the Chamber’s view, the most serious problem at present is that of

                                25,000,000 pesos (the American part only), and pointed out that

                                        our departure from Buenos Aires on August 4, certain
                                        developments have taken place which have been reported in an
                                        airmail letter to us by the resident representative of The
                                        First Boston Corporation, Dr. Oscar Muller, under date of
                                        August 21, as follows:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                            <p>“Around August 10 the peso started appreciating
                                                suddenly in the free market, going from 395 to 353
                                                or just 4 above the official selling rate of 345. It
                                                looked indeed as if the whole system would have to
                                                be overhauled at a moment’s notice, but instead of
                                                that the Government started lowering the official
                                                selling rate from 345 to 337, and sold exchange in
                                                order to counteract too fast an appreciation. The
                                                result is that now we have the official selling rate
                                                at 338, and the free market rate at around 365, or a
                                                difference of about 8%. It would seem that the
                                                policy is not to permit unduly violent fluctuations.
                                                More than ever I believe the tendency of the peso is
                                                to appreciate gradually. The present situation is
                                                being taken advantage of by people who held peso
                                                balances and were waiting for permits. They give up
                                                waiting and go into the free market at a loss of say
                                                8% to 10%, and in this way a great deal of
                                                unblocking of pesos is taking place with the problem
                                                of blocked funds finding its own solution.</p>
                                            <p>“After your departure grain prices rose still
                                                further, then they receded, but are firm once more.”

                                The Chamber of Commerce Exchange Committee stated that to some
                                extent liquidation was occurring in this way, though this method
                                involves a substantial loss in the exchange difference (See Appendix
                                2.). The Government has offered to pay off blocked funds with
                                five-year notes <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0481"/>(similar to
                                the arrangement offered Italy) but these are not acceptable,
                                according to the Chamber, unless they can be discounted for cash
                                (dollars) in the United States. The Exchange Controller is anxious
                                to clear up the unpaid balances, and points out that the removal
                                from the market of this potential pressure would be of great
                                assistance. Both he and the Chamber’s Exchange Committee have raised
                                the question whether the Export-Import Bank could be interested in a
                                transaction of this character.</p>

                                    <item>Both Argentina and our exporters wish to clear up unpaid
                                        balances. This may now be done through the free market and
                                        to some extent is being done, but this method involves an
                                        exchange loss. The alternative method of payment in
                                        five-year notes depends upon the discounting of such notes
                                        by the Export-Import Bank or some other American
                                        institution. Anything we can do to facilitate the
                                        liquidation of these balances will undoubtedly assist
                                        Argentina in her general solution of the exchange problem,
                                        and will thereby improve our own treatment on current trade

                                of frozen credits at the official rate of exchange, which in terms
                                of our old gold dollar would mean 16.55 pesos per U. S. dollar, and

                                that to omit the frozen credit provision would represent

                            <p>In approaching the consideration of these four alternative lines of
                                policy we have borne in mind the long history of negotiation with
                                the Chilean Government concerning our exchange problems, during
                                which time the economic and trade position of Chile has materially
                                changed for the better. This improvement has occurred particularly
                                since the period of active negotiation began last November. Our
                                Government has consistently refused to consider the first plan
                                outlined above, a <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0483"

                                pursuing the second alternative, the Department in the beginning was
                                evidently much concerned with receiving most-favored-nation
                                treatment with respect to current trade. But partly by reason of the
                                pressure exerted through our Embassy, acting on the Department’s
                                instructions, and in large part, by reason of the general
                                improvement in Chilean trade, this problem has already been resolved
                                without any formal agreement, so that today we are in fact receiving
                                equal treatment with respect to current trade, exchange being made
                                available to our exporters at the export bill rate of 25 to 1 and to
                                the compensation countries at the official rate plus a premium which
                                equalizes the price of exchange as between such countries and
                                ourselves. A formal agreement, therefore, would accomplish nothing
                                more than legalization of the existing <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo</hi>.</p>
                            <p>As the Department has consistently contended, such a formal agreement
                                is unacceptable if not accompanied by an agreement with respect to
                                frozen credits giving us in this respect also most-favored-nation
                                treatment. All of the compensation treaties contain a provision for
                                the liquidation of frozen credits at a rate which is better than the
                                export draft rate now applied to current trade. Our problem has been
                                how to secure equally favorable treatment on frozen credits without
                                consenting to a compensation treaty. If now we should negotiate a
                                general agreement with respect to current trade, and acquiesce in
                                Chile’s refusal to include in it most-favored-nation treatment for
                                our frozen credits, we should apparently be relinquishing what has
                                been, from the beginning of the negotiation, a major contention of
                                principle, for the sake of a general agreement which now can give us
                                nothing more than the treatment we are already receiving.</p>
                            <p rend="center">III</p>
                            <p>Our visit to Chile has impressed us with the complicated character of
                                the frozen credits question. It is not easy to determine what would
                                constitute for us most-favored-nation treatment or how desirable
                                such treatment would be if we could get it. The French and other
                                agreements are based on the official rate of exchange (three pence
                                gold); in terms of our devalued dollar this would be 9.6 pesos for 1
                                dollar, but in terms of the old dollar it would be 16.55 to 1. It
                                can be argued that Chile was not responsible for our devaluation and
                                is entitled to consider 16.55 to 1 as its official rate. But to get
                                even this rate, which the Finance Minister firmly refuses except as
                                part of a compensation agreement, it would be necessary to consent
                                to a time schedule which might mean only very gradual liquidation.
                                In the French agreement 20 percent of nitrate sales to France are
                                blocked to provide exchange for frozen credits, so that unless
                                nitrate sales are large, liquidation is slow. A number of the
                                Americans interviewed, when <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0484"
                                />asked whether they preferred slow liquidation at a good rate or
                                faster liquidation at a worse rate, put greater stress upon the
                                latter.</p>
                            <p>To provide exchange at the official rate for frozen credits, Chile
                                compels the Nitrate Sales Corporation to sell exchange at that same
                                rate, instead of at the much more favorable export draft rate. Since
                                the nitrate industry represents largely American capital, such a
                                solution of our frozen credits problem would be at the expense of an
                                American interest. Our nitrate representatives, moreover, point out
                                that since they use a considerable part of their exchange to buy
                                American imports (including oil products, motors, electrical
                                equipment, rubber, etc.), any such attempt to improve the position
                                of American exporters on frozen credits would worsen our position in
                                current trade. It should be pointed out, also, that most of the
                                compensation treaties include only a portion of the frozen credits,
                                so that they do not pretend to provide a complete solution of the
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>To determine an equitable rate for the liquidation of our frozen
                                credits, or the amount that would be liquidated were exchange
                                offered, presents great difficulty. Part was frozen in July, 1931,
                                when exchange control was imposed, and when the rate was about 8 to
                                1; but in reporting frozen balances creditors include as well the
                                subsequent accumulations, when the rate was fluctuating from 8 to 60
                                to the dollar. A large portion of the frozen credits, moreover, has
                                been invested in property or in securities, and in some cases large
                                profits have been made. Some credits have been liquidated at the
                                export draft rate, including some 18,000,000 pesos in response to
                                two general offers made by the Finance Minister this year. Some
                                credits are now so tied up that they cannot or will not be
                                liquidated. This part includes 50,000,000 pesos used by Electric
                                Bond &amp; Share to buy up its local 8 percent debentures, effecting
                                an important saving in interest. It probably should include also
                                18,000,000 pesos of bank deposits belonging to the Telephone
                                Company, which appear to be destined, according to the local
                                representative, for investment in Chile, in lieu of new capital from
                                abroad, to carry out expansion in accordance with the company’s
                                contract. Thus of 157,900,000 pesos of “frozen credits” reported to
                                the Commercial Attaché’s office in response to his questionnaire,
                                our inquiries would indicate that 18,000,000 pesos have been
                                liquidated and at least 68,000,000 pesos cannot or will not be
                                liquidated, leaving a total of about 72,000,000 pesos, which at the
                                current export draft rate is less than $3,000,000. What part of this
                                was blocked prior to July, 1931, and therefore is in equity entitled
                                to the official rate, and what part since that time, when the
                                importer was taking his chances, I am not able to determine. In
                                addition, there are some $4,000,000 of frozen credits in the form of
                                unpaid drafts, receivables, merchandise or other <pb n="415"
                                    xml:id="pg_415" facs="0485"/>items requiring payment by the
                                debtor in dollars. All these, presumably, are in a different
                                category, representing sums not yet collected from the debtor (local
                                importers, etc.). What portion of these debts may still be good, and
                                at what rates the debtors should now be required to provide exchange
                                present difficult questions. But in general, it seems clear that the
                                total amount of collectible or transferable credits is substantially
                                smaller than had previously been supposed. In particular, it should
                                be pointed out that of the total estimated frozen credits (Feb. 21,
                                1934), only 53,800,000 pesos is represented by deposits in banks;
                                and that from this amount there must be deducted at least 31,000,000
                                pesos, of which 18,000,000 has already been liquidated this year at
                                the export draft rate and 13,000,000 represents the Telephone
                                Company’s deposit at that time. These deductions would leave about
                                22,000,000 pesos, or less than a million dollars at the current
                                export draft rate (or $1,333,000 at the rate of 16.55 to 1).</p>
                            <p rend="center">IV</p>
                            <p>Throughout a long interview the Finance Minister discussed freely his
                                present policy, but consistently refused to consider any better rate
                                for frozen credits except in connection with a compensation treaty.
                                I am satisfied that except in response to pressure in the form of
                                some genuine threat to Chile’s markets in the United States, he
                                cannot be induced to alter this position.</p>
                            <p>His present policy with respect to exchange is to maintain the export
                                draft rate at 25 to 1, equally for all countries, as to current
                                trade, and to liquidate frozen credits at this rate, except as to
                                the compensation countries. He has induced the British to furnish
                                him a complete list of their frozen credits’ and has liquidated all
                                but £40,000 of the British credits willing to accept this rate. He
                                realizes fully, and pointed out in some detail, that some of the
                                American credits do not now properly belong in the frozen credit
                                category. He has made two general offers to liquidate our frozen
                                credits at the export draft rate, and is convinced that he will in
                                time succeed in clearing up the problem by this method. He asked us
                                if the Embassy is able and willing to furnish a true list of frozen
                                credits. He dislikes compensation treaties and is convinced that
                                they have worked to the injury of the foreign countries which have
                                insisted on them, and have resulted in a scarcity of exchange to
                                finance their exports. He points out that Germany has not renewed
                                the treaty which expired on June 30, 1934. He insists that the
                                compensation countries themselves provide the differential in favor
                                of their frozen credits in the high price for nitrate which prevails
                                in these countries as compared with the price in England and the
                                United States.</p>
                            <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0486"/>
                            <p rend="center">V</p>
                            <p>My conclusion is that preferential treatment for frozen credits,
                                whether we mean by that treatment equal to that accorded to France
                                and other compensation countries or merely a preferential rate as
                                compared with current trade, cannot be secured except by a
                                compensation treaty or by some other form of definite commercial
                                pressure; and that in view of the relatively small size of the
                                genuine frozen credits now remaining and the complicated status and
                                character of these credits, making difficult the calculation of an
                                equitable preferential rate, it would be unwise and impolitic to
                                pursue such a course, since by it we would jeopardize the genuine
                                good will which now exists, and might impair a trade position which
                                appears to be distinctly favorable. If the Department should take
                                this view, there would remain the question whether it wished,
                                possibly after discussion with the American interests at home and in
                                Chile, to acquiesce in the Minister’s request for a list of American
                                frozen credits, to be provided through the Embassy, as the British
                                have done, or would consider that such a list should be provided by
                                the private interests concerned.</p>
                            <p>If this policy were pursued with respect to frozen credits, the
                                broader question would be whether it is still advantageous to
                                negotiate a general agreement respecting current trade. My own view
                                is that in view of the fact that we are now receiving without
                                agreement as good treatment on current trade as could be had by
                                means of an agreement, there is little to be gained by a procedure
                                which would involve a formal relinquishment of our contention for
                                the principle of most-favored-nation treatment with respect to
                                frozen credits. I should therefore be inclined to favor the fourth
                                of the alternatives outlined in section I (pages 23–24<note n="9"

                                officials and American business men as well as our own government
                                representatives. A midday conference with the American Association
                                acting as an American Chamber of Commerce in Montevideo was followed
                                by a round table conference with the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                                the President of the Banco de la Bepublica, the official bank,
                                officials of the Foreign Office, representatives of American and
                                Uruguayan business, and our official representatives. The following
                                day <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0487"/>included conferences
                                with the Minister of Finance and officers of the Banco de la
                                Bepublica and a final conference with the Minister for Foreign
                                Affairs at his home.</p>
                            <p>Our arrival in Uruguay coincided with the announcement of an
                                important modification in the system of exchange control, by the
                                project of law and decree of July 28 (See Appendix 1).</p>
                            <p>Although complete control over exchange has been vested in the Bank
                                of Uruguay since 1931, it has not been thoroughly effective. An
                                artificially high rate of exchange was maintained which operated to
                                delay the attainment of equilibrium in the balance of payments. The
                                artificial rate gave the Government cheap exchange to service the
                                external debt but was too high to check imports or stimulate
                                exports. Also, it gave rise to smuggling and other evasions. Large
                                accumulations of frozen credits have occurred of which to date only
                                some 34,000,000 pesos have been funded through the issuance of the
                                5-year “amortizable obligations” leaving a backlog estimated between
                                20,000,000 and 25,000,000 pesos.</p>
                            <p>Partly, however, as a result of better prices for export products and
                                also by reason of the reduction in outgoing payments, caused by
                                cutting the interest on national external bonds to 3½ percent,
                                equilibrium in the balance of payments (arrearages aside) was
                                reached toward the end of 1933, and has since been maintained,
                                according to the Government.</p>
                            <p>The new system of control is described as a concession to the
                                agricultural interests and exporters, who have demanded freedom to
                                sell their export bills at the “free” instead of the “official”
                                rate.</p>
                            <p>The principal provisions of the new system are: <list>

                            <p>Until the middle of 1933, Uruguay apparently allocated to American
                                interests more than double the amount of exchange made by our
                                purchases <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0488"/>of Uruguayan
                                goods, although the amount was insufficient to prevent the
                                accumulation of large amounts of frozen credits. Of the “amortizable
                                obligations” issued to clear up these blocked balances, some U. S.
                                $6 million represent dollar bonds, and unfunded unpaid balances of
                                Americans now total, it is estimated, an additional U. S. $2.3
                                million.</p>
                            <p>During the past year, however, the Banco de la Bepublica has been
                                restricting its allocation of exchange to American concerns,
                                although it still seems to be allotting more than is created by
                                Uruguayan exports to the United States. American firms received 46
                                percent less “official” and “compensated” exchange during the first
                                six months of this year than during the corresponding period of
                                1933, although Uruguay’s exports to the United States have increased
                                in recent months. In the “free market” established in February of
                                this year, however, American interests have been able to purchase
                                some exchange at a rate averaging 45 percent over the official rate
                                and 5 percent over the rate fixed for compensated exchange.</p>
                            <p>During this time British interests have been able, we are informed,
                                to obtain substantially sufficient exchange for their requirements,
                                much of it at the favorable “official rate.” Exports to Great
                                Britain, Uruguay’s principal foreign market, create enough exchange
                                for British requirements, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                                states that Great Britain has exerted pressure to obtain an
                                agreement whereby all of the exchange created by her Uruguayan
                                purchases be made available to her nationals. Interests of other
                                countries with which Uruguay has “favorable” trade balances are also
                                alleged to have been favored in exchange allocation during this
                                period. We have no recent figures to measure the discrimination in
                                exchange treatment from which American interests suffer, but its
                                existence is freely admitted by Uruguayan officials, who point out
                                that they are being forced towards a bilateral system of exchange
                                allocation by the countries which are Uruguay’s chief markets. In
                                addition, Uruguay also discriminates as between imports which she
                                classes as necessitous and those which she regards as less
                                essential. Thus, American oil companies during the first half of
                                this year received $702,000 in exchange at the official rate whereas
                                only $1,160,000 was allocated for all other American imports, of
                                which one-half was at the favorable official rate and the other half
                                at the 40% higher “compensated” rate.</p>
                            <p>The allocation of exchange to the oil companies is the subject of
                                complaint by other American firms which point out that the allotment
                                is charged by the control against the American quota of exchange
                                although only a part of the petroleum products involved comes from
                                the United States.</p>
                            <p>American bondholders also claim to be the object of discrimination
                                through the action of the Uruguayan Government in 1933 in decreeing
                                    <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0489"/>that interest on all
                                its external bonds shall be paid at the flat rate of 3½ percent
                                irrespective of the original coupon. This rate is full interest on
                                the principal British issue—the Consolidated—whereas it is little
                                more than one-half of the interest on the principal American loans,
                                which bear 6 percent. The sterling loans which were the subject of
                                consolidation, however, bore interest of 5 and 6 percent. It is
                                understood that the Department is already informed that the
                                Uruguayan Government maintains that no discrimination against
                                American bondholders is involved. It is mentioned here because the
                                reasons advanced by the Uruguayan Government for its reduction of
                                interest on external obligations are the scarcity and high cost of
                                foreign exchange.</p>
                            <p>It appears doubtful that the condition of insufficient exchange and
                                discrimination in its allocation, in which American interests find
                                themselves, will disappear under the new system of exchange control.
                                According to our copies of the texts, the new law and regulations
                                definitely provide that not only “import licenses” but “free” and
                                “official” exchange as well will be apportioned according to quotas
                                “for commodities and for countries” to be set up by the Bank of the
                                Republic.</p>
                            <p>Further, the Minister of Foreign Affairs frankly stated that in order
                                to preserve or extend her foreign markets, Uruguay is ready to make
                                agreements offering exchange and tariff concessions. No definite
                                agreements have as yet been made as far as we are informed although
                                negotiations with Great Britain are in progress. The Minister also
                                said that exchange concessions had been offered Italy in return for
                                military purchases of Uruguayan meat.</p>
                            <p>Agreements of this kind, by corralling a greater share of exchange,
                                might result in further restriction of allotments to American
                                firms.</p>
                            <p rend="center">III</p>
                            <p>More dollar exchange is normally required for service of dollar
                                bonds, frozen credit obligations, interest on American investments
                                in Uruguay and imports from the United States than is provided by
                                American purchases of Uruguayan products. A compensation treaty
                                would, therefore, offer no solution of our exchange problem even if
                                such agreements were in line with our general policy. It would be
                                possible to increase the supply of exchange by a reciprocal tariff
                                agreement but it seems doubtful that such an agreement could be
                                decided upon in the near future.</p>
                            <p>There would appear to be no opportunity for effective protest against
                                Uruguay’s system of allocating exchange unless Uruguay should
                                further reduce her American exchange quota and require that the
                                entire sum necessary for interest on her dollar bonds, in addition
                                to the exchange <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0490"/>necessary
                                for imports from us should be derived from the exchange created by
                                our purchases of Uruguayan products. This would leave little
                                exchange for our imports. According to our information, Uruguay has
                                so far been taking a considerable part of the exchange necessary for
                                dollar debt service from the general exchange fund resulting from
                                its exports to all countries.</p>
                            <p>The complaint has been made that the quota of exchange for American
                                requirements is smaller than it should be because exchange for
                                petroleum products brought in by American companies from Venezuela
                                and other Latin American oil fields is charged to it.</p>
                            <p>A report on this question from our representatives in Montevideo
                                would be desirable and, in case their investigation shows the
                                complaint to be founded on fact, also a statement of their views as
                                to the advisability of making representations. There are various
                                angles to this problem. For example, the control authorities might
                                require information as to whether the exchange necessary for payment
                                of the oil really returned to the country of production.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the above possibility of obtaining some increase in our
                                exchange allotment and the possibility of creating more exchange
                                through a reciprocal tariff agreement, there appears to be no
                                special solution of our exchange difficulties’ in Uruguay.</p>
                            <p>Apparently we shall have an exchange problem as long as Uruguay
                                maintains any system of exchange control. Exchange control is
                                inevitably accompanied by discrimination in favor of nations which
                                are good customers for her products. Our problem will disappear
                                when, through the achievement of equilibrium in her international
                                account, exchange control is lifted. Our policy should, therefore,
                                be one of assistance towards this general solution of the country’s
                                exchange difficulties.</p>
                            <p>There has been an improvement in Uruguayan economic conditions and it
                                appears very possible that Uruguay is now working definitely towards
                                substantial freedom of exchange. President Terra has announced that
                                this is the policy of his government. The new system is a step in
                                this direction. The rural interests which are powerful, are pressing
                                for abolition of control. A balance in the international account has
                                apparently been obtained, and a balanced budget is forecast for this
                                year. Uruguay has a relatively large gold reserve, a part of which
                                according to the new exchange legislation she can use as a
                                stabilization fund for the period of transition to exchange freedom,
                                and, if necessary, in paying off a part of her frozen credit
                                obligations. It is also reported that she is considering the use of
                                part of the gold reserves to convert external bonds and thus reduce
                                the outgo of exchange for debt service.</p>
                            <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0491"/>
                            <p>There is, however, a considerable opposition, including the importers
                                and salaried classes, to any breakdown of exchange control which
                                might involve further external depreciation of the peso. Also
                                fearing the impairment of foreign markets for meat, a principal
                                export, Uruguay stands ready to give exchange concessions through
                                compensation agreements, a circumstance which might tend to prolong
                                the period of exchange control.</p>
                            <p>If relaxation of exchange control is to be obtained it appears
                                essential for the government to persuade the owners of the present
                                large accumulation of blocked balances to accept payment over a
                                period of years.</p>
                            <p>The objection of most American owners of blocked accounts to the
                                acceptance of the proposed “frozen credit” bonds is understood to be
                                that, being unmarketable, it is at present impossible to turn them
                                into cash. If through the Import-Export Bank or some other
                                institution these bonds could be discounted or otherwise made
                                bankable on satisfactory terms, we would not only aid the American
                                interests involved but would assist Uruguay in ending exchange
                                control.</p>
                            <p>The new exchange control program provides for the issuance of “frozen
                                credit” bonds to bear not more than 4 percent interest and to be
                                amortized within 20 years. It is assumed that the latter figure is a
                                maximum. If it is really Uruguay’s intention to issue 20-year bonds,
                                it is to be doubted that there will be a very large subscription for
                                them by holders of frozen balances unless a market for the bonds
                                were made. We believe that inquiry should be made as to the
                                Government’s intention with respect to the maturity of the proposed
                                new issue of frozen credit bonds and that we should urge, in
                                Uruguay’s own interest, that it be kept down to the shortest
                                possible period. It is to be noted that Argentina’s endeavor to fund
                                the remaining frozen credits by the issue of 5–year 2% bonds has so
                                far not been successful. While it is possible that Uruguay may
                                before long find it possible substantially to remove exchange
                                control, the long view of her trade and exchange position is not too
                                encouraging. Meat products are an important part of her exports and
                                Uruguayan stock raisers fear that England, the chief market, may
                                restrict her purchases as a result of the policy of Empire
                                preferences and, recently, of protecting the livestock industry in
                                the United Kingdom.</p>
                            <p>During our conference at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Uruguayan
                                officials frequently referred to the effect of our 1930 tariff on
                                Uruguayan exports to the United States. Uruguay was a relatively
                                important customer of the United States prior to the depression and
                                our investments, private and portfolio, yielded a good return.
                                Uruguayan recovery is essentially dependent on her principal
                                customers continuing to give her the same access to their markets
                                that she formerly enjoyed.</p>

                            <p rend="center">IV</p>
                            <p>In conclusion it may be well to record that we were cordially
                                received by the Uruguayan officials, particularly Señor Arteaga,
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs, who represents the agricultural and
                                livestock interests which apparently are exercising increasing
                                control in government. He appeared gratified to learn that our views
                                with respect to the advantage of relaxing exchange control coincided
                                with that of his party. It is clear that the policy of this new
                                group is to permit, through enlargement of the free market, a frank
                                recognition of the external depreciation of the peso while at the
                                same time endeavoring to prevent this depreciation from resulting in
                                internal inflation. In this policy Señor Arteaga’s group has to
                                contend, however, with not only the importing interests but also the
                                heads of the official bank, who are apparently dominated by a
                                conservative allegiance to what might be called preserving the
                                integrity of the old peso. It seems not improbable that our
                                assurance to Arteaga and his friends that in our view he was
                                pursuing the correct policy, may serve in some measure to strengthen
                                his hand. He and other government officials also appeared to receive
                                very favorably our suggestions for the technical improvement of the
                                exchange control, particularly the need for an adequate reporting
                                service which would enable them to know their balance of payments
                                position and to make use of this knowledge in working out the steps
                                for further relaxing exchange control.</p>

                                Martínez Government of El Salvador …”</note> The President informed
                            me this morning that in his opinion no further steps will be taken in
                            connection with proposed conference to be held in February until
                            government of El Salvador is recognized by Government of the United
                            States. As soon as El Salvador is recognized by us he expects that
                            President Ubico will make the move. He said that he personally hopes
                            that conference will be held in “neutral” place and specifically
                            mentioned Panama as desirable, particularly he said because of the
                            possibility that Panama might be included within the terms of the new
                            treaty which it is proposed should be concluded. While he said that the
                            agenda for the proposed conference had not been officially discussed he
                            expressed the belief that the question of the political union of the
                            Central American States (including Panama) might be brought up. He
                            expressed himself as being strongly in favor of such a union because of
                            the economies which could thereby be effected by all the countries and
                            said that the attitude of the United States Government towards such a
                            proposal would have an important effect.</p>

                        <p>14. With reference to telegram from Minister at Managua number 30,
                            January 26, 5 p.m., this morning I had a long talk with the Foreign
                            Minister about the forthcoming Central American conference. He told me
                            that since his return 3 days ago from Montevideo he had not had a chance
                            to consult the President at length and to <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424"
                                facs="0494"/>formulate definitely the Guatemalan viewpoint with
                            respect to the conference. However, he said that he was in a position to
                            give me the following information:</p>
                        <p>President Ubico and Skinner-Klee<note n="3" xml:id="d496fn3">Alfredo
                                Skinner-Klee, Guatemalan Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> are
                            firmly of the opinion that the conference should be held in Guatemala
                            and they would like to have its inauguration on Washington’s Birthday,
                            February 22. They prefer that the invitations should be extended by the
                            Nicaraguan Government in the names of the Governments of Guatemala,
                            Honduras, and Nicaragua. Without suggesting a particular day they feel
                            that the invitations should be extended sometime next week. They will be
                            glad to include Panama in the conference, as well as in any treaties
                            that may be drawn up, as long as the United States approves such
                            participation and does not feel that the obligations assumed are in
                            conflict with the special relationship existing between the United
                            States and Panama. They also agree that the conference will be of such
                            importance that the delegations should comprise at least three members
                            each.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then said that he had not yet obtained the
                            President’s approval of a draft agenda embodying the views of the
                            Guatemalan Government but that he hoped to provide me with such a draft
                            on Monday or Tuesday. However, he said that he plans to propose to the
                            conference a number of measures tending towards a Central American union
                            but not including a specific proposal for political federation. He feels
                            the latter may develop gradually if the various preliminary measures are
                            successful. These measures would include: Uniformity of laws, free trade
                            throughout the Isthmus, a common Central American citizenship, a single
                            diplomatic and consular service for the Isthmus, a unified educational
                            system, and a common monetary system preferably based on the quetzal.
                            Unlike President Ubico, he does not favor revision of the Treaty of
                            Peace and Amity to include sanctions but he feels that the existing
                            provision regarding non-recognition of revolutionary governments should
                            be re-enacted in a new treaty to be subscribed to by all the Central
                            American republics. He said that he hoped to persuade President Ubico to
                            abandon his intention of insisting upon sanctions.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that he felt that Guatemala,
                            Honduras, and Nicaragua should agree beforehand in a general way on the
                            conference agenda and that they should go ahead along the lines
                            indicated above whether or not the other republics joined with them. He
                            also indicated that one of the most important factors for the success of
                            the conference would be the approval and encouragement <pb n="425"
                                xml:id="pg_425" facs="0495"/>of the State Department and he
                            expressed a desire to know whether the suggested plans meet with the
                            approval of the Department and also whether it would view
                            sympathetically the issuance of an invitation to Panama.</p>

                                p.m., from the Chargé in Guatemala, <hi rend="italic"
                                >supra</hi>.</note> President Sacasa told me this morning that he
                            proposes to confer today with Honduran Chargé d’Affaires to inquire
                            regarding President Carías’ views as to the form which invitation to the
                            conference should take and as to the place of meeting. He said that
                            tomorrow he would see Guatemalan Minister and state that he is prepared
                            to join in inviting Costa Rica and El Salvador to conference in the
                            manner which may appear most convenient to Guatemala, Honduras and
                            Nicaragua. (He said he would not mention to Guatemalan Minister the
                            question of meeting place. Ubico’s views in favor of Guatemala having
                            been previously communicated to him by Ubico.) The President expressed
                            himself in substance as follows: He has no objection to meeting in
                            Guatemala and will gladly abide by views of majority of five Central
                            American states on this point. He would prefer Panama, however,
                            (1)—because it is a “neutral” country and (2)—because if conference were
                            meeting there it would be a simple matter to invite Panama to attend,
                            rather than that Panama should send delegates to some far off point
                            after the conference had assembled. If an invitation is sent to Panama
                            it should be sent not merely by Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala but by
                            the other Central American states as well. While agreeable to conference
                            meeting in February he considers it wise not to move too hastily as the
                            delegations should be chosen with care and the agenda fully discussed
                            among the inviting states.</p>
                        <p>He said he would advise me of the results of his conversations with
                            Honduran and Guatemalan representatives.</p>

                            yesterday he told me that he was deferring definite consideration of
                            agenda for forthcoming Central American conference until arrival of two
                            Honduran delegates to Montevideo Conference where they had undoubtedly
                            discussed this subject with the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua and
                            Guatemala at Montevideo. The Honduran delegates are now in New Orleans
                            and are expected here within a few days. The Foreign Minister said he
                            did not know whether President Carías was agreeable to holding the
                            conference in Guatemala but that he, the Foreign Minister, believed
                            Panama the more suitable place in the event that Panama is to be
                            included in the conference as well as in any treaties. He said that
                            questions as to which Government should issue invitations, date for
                            convening of conference, place where conference should be held, when and
                            in what form invitations should be extended to Panama, could be settled
                            promptly by interchange of telegrams between the Governments of
                            Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua but that he thought the drafting of
                            the agenda might be expedited by a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of
                            these countries at Tegucigalpa.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister expressed the hope that something would emanate from
                            the conference that would aid in the settlement of the long-pending
                            boundary dispute between Central American countries especially that

                            communicate his views direct with Ubico. Sacasa told me he would first
                            await reaction from Carías.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he is willing to leave the date of the conference
                            to the President of Guatemala. With respect to the apparent modification
                            of his views regarding the place of conference he said that he now
                            considered it wise to have the conference in the Central American
                            country which has the greatest population and which therefore should
                            naturally have the hegemony in this region.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is my understanding of President Sacasa’s private views
                            which, of course, are not for repetition to officials of other <pb

                        <p>15. My 14, January 27, 3 p.m. The Foreign Minister told me this afternoon
                            that the Guatemalan Government now feels that it would be preferable not
                            to agree beforehand with Honduras and Nicaragua upon the conference
                            agenda. He plans to transmit to the Governments of Honduras and
                            Nicaragua by the next air mail (Saturday) the draft of an invitation
                            which President Ubico will ask President Sacasa to extend to the
                            Governments of Central America and of Panama. The inclusion of Panama
                            will depend upon the desire of President Sacasa and the Department as
                            Guatemala has no objection. Skinner-Klee promised me a copy of the draft
                            invitation as soon as completed and I shall telegraph its substance to
                            the Department and forward copies to the Department and interested
                            missions by air mail. The Foreign Minister said that the invitation will
                            be in the names of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua and will invite the
                            various Governments to participate in a conference to meet in Guatemala
                            February 22 for the purpose of revising the several treaties of
                                1923.<note n="10" xml:id="d501fn10">See <hi rend="italic">Conference

                                Office, 1923), pp. 287 ff.</note> He pointed out that by mentioning
                            all the pacts instead of only the Treaty of Peace and Amity a
                            sufficiently broad scope would be provided to cover any likely
                            developments.</p>
                        <p>Skinner-Klee is fully aware of the probable attitude of Costa Rica to any
                            measures tending towards a Central American union and he has little hope
                            that she can be induced to enter into the arrangements he has in mind.
                            He believes, however, that if the invitation is extended as suggested
                            above and if Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua do not make any
                            preliminary plans among themselves Costa Rica could have no real cause
                            for complaint or for refusing to attend the conference. He remarked he
                            is of the opinion that Salvador will be glad to attend and that she will
                            probably join Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in any measures of
                            common interest that may be adopted at the conference. He is now working
                            on the draft of the proposals he intends to submit to the conference and
                            he promised me a copy as soon as it has been approved by President
                            Ubico. He said <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0499"/>that he would
                            greatly appreciate knowing the Department’s reaction to his plan.</p>
                        <p>Skinner-Klee concluded by saying that since the draft invitation would
                            not be mailed until Saturday the invitations could not be extended until
                            next week but he feels that there will still be ample time for
                            preparations before February 22.</p>

                        <p>6. Your No. 14, January 27, 3 p.m. and 15, January 31, 5 p.m. You may
                            state to the Minister of Foreign Affairs orally and confidentially that
                            as he has pointed out Panama and the United States have a special
                            relationship and special obligations toward each other that do not exist
                            in the case of the United States and the countries of Central America.
                            This circumstance might limit the extent to which Panama would feel that
                            it could enter into a special treaty relationship with the Central
                            American countries and it would also influence the attitude of the
                            United States toward any treaty arrangement which included Panama. For
                            these reasons the Guatemalan Government <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430"
                                facs="0500"/>may wish to consider the wisdom of including Panama in

                            courtesy in speaking to you on these questions, and add that the

                            Minister confidentially about the inclusion of Panama in the proposed
                            conventions. Upon being informed of the Department’s views as set forth
                            in the telegram under reference Skinner-Klee said that his Government
                            would advise President Sacasa to limit the invitations to the five
                            Central American republics. He added that he had been doubtful all along

                        <p>39. My 38, February 5, 1 p.m. The President showed me this evening a
                            protocol delivered to him today by Hernández de León which had already
                            been signed by President Ubico on February 3 and in which provision is
                            made for signature also by the Presidents of Nicaragua and Honduras.
                            Preamble to protocol after referring to generalizations regarding
                            desirability of maintaining friendly Central American relations states
                            that “the five Central American nationalities” are desirous of revising
                            the General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1923. In the body of protocol
                            it is provided that President of Nicaragua shall extend in name of
                            Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua invitations to Governments of
                            Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua (<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>) to meet in Guatemala on February 22 to
                            revise the treaty or treaties of 1923.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he is telegraphing to Ubico tonight suggesting
                            that he (Sacasa) should not extend the invitation for a conference in
                            Guatemala much as he appreciates the honor of speaking for Guatemala and
                            Honduras. He stated that he considered Costa Rica particularly would
                            resent not being invited by Guatemala. He also referred to incorrectness
                            of the three countries speaking (in preamble) for all five.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the President fully understands our attitude (as explained
                            in Department’s circular telegram of January 31, 7 p.m.) and merely
                            wishes to keep us fully informed.</p>

                        <p>14. Carlos Izaguirre now acting as a private secretary to President
                            Carías called at the Legation for diplomatic visa and told me that he
                                <pb n="434" xml:id="pg_434" facs="0504"/>is leaving for Washington
                            on United Fruit Company steamer due to arrive New York February 23d and
                            will consult with Honduran Minister in Washington and Department
                            regarding some understanding with the Department that it would give its
                            support and adherence to some modification at Guatemala City Conference
                            of article No, 2 of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity of 1923. He
                            believes that without this assurance of support from the United States
                            Government any modification of this article would not be agreed to by
                            Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. When he asked me what I thought of
                            the idea I expressed as my own opinion the substance of the Department’s
                            confidential circular telegram of January 31, 7 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Izaguirre said that the Conference at Guatemala City has been
                            definitely postponed until March 15th, that he with Augusto Coello, who
                            was delegate at Montevideo Conference, and Silverio Laínez, now Honduran
                            Minister at San Salvador, will be three of the four delegates chosen for
                            Guatemala Conference, fourth to be selected later.</p>

                        <p>52. My 51, February 16, noon.<note n="13" xml:id="d514fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> The President stated to me that despite his having
                            been requested by Ubico to extend the invitations to the Conference and
                            his having suggested that he be given leeway as to the date, Ubico is
                            now apparently making the question of the date a pretext for the
                            exclusion of Costa Rica from the Conference. He said that if Costa Rica
                            does not attend the Conference he feels that El Salvador will likewise
                            not attend. He requested me to make a suggestion to the Department as
                            coming from him that President Ubico be urged by us to reconsider his
                            attitude so as to avoid certain failure of the Conference. He said that
                            the fact that three of the five countries are in favor of March 15
                            should be a determining factor. He added that he hopes we will say to
                            Ubico that we greatly appreciate the compliment of his wishing to open
                            the Conference on Washington’s birthday, but that we do not wish the
                            Conference to fail because of the desire to fix February 22 as the
                            date.</p>
                        <p>When I reminded him of the Department’s policy (as expressed in the
                            Department’s circular telegram of January 31, 7 p.m.) he said that he
                            understood our point of view; on the other hand he recalled that the
                            initial step regarding a Conference was suggested by the Department <pb
                                n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0505"/>and that he had gladly accepted
                            such suggestion. He expressed the hope therefore that the Department
                            would see its way clear to endeavor to save the project from failure at
                            the outset.</p>

                        <p>17. The Foreign Minister sent for me this morning to say that, in view of
                            the difficulties that have arisen over fixing a date for the Conference
                            and because of the desire of certain of the Governments to know
                            beforehand what proposals are likely to be made, the Guatemalan
                            Government is sending to the four other Central American Governments by
                            air mail tomorrow two draft treaties that its delegation will submit to
                            the Conference. Copies of these drafts and of their covering letter were
                            furnished me this afternoon and I am forwarding them with translations
                            to the Department and the Central American missions by air mail
                            tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>Skinner-Klee indicated that his Government was no longer greatly
                            concerned over the date of the Conference as the decision to make known
                            its draft proposals to the other Governments as well as to the press
                            makes it less important to hurry the opening of the Conference.</p>

                        <p>1. Identical letter sent by Guatemalan Minister for Foreign Affairs to
                            Foreign Ministers of Costa Rica, Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
                            Letter states that Guatemalan Government did not prepare a program to
                            cover the activities of the Conference as it seemed more fitting that
                            each delegation should form its own projects and announce them at the
                            Conference. However, Guatemalan delegation was instructed to draw up a
                            draft treaty of peace and amity that would be simpler than the present
                            one and would not cause differences of interpretation. This draft was
                            prepared and embodies in one instrument most of the provisions of the
                            several treaties of 1923. Letter further states that President Ubico had
                            intended to present his personal views of the needs of Central America
                            to the Conference but that he has embodied them in another pact which is
                            enclosed along with the draft treaty of peace and amity. He feels that
                            with good will the Conference cannot fail to be a success and he sees no
                            obstacle to the meeting of the Conference in the near future at the date

                            anxious that forthcoming Conference shall accomplish something practical

                        <p>19. Foreign Minister sent for me this afternoon and said that President
                            Ubico would greatly appreciate the good offices of the Department in
                            bringing to the attention of the Governments of Nicaragua and Honduras
                            the importance of a new treaty of peace and amity, and especially of a
                            nonrecognition agreement such as that provided by article VII of the
                            draft treaty which the Guatemalan delegation is to submit to the
                            forthcoming Conference. Skinner-Klee apparently feels that similar
                            efforts would not be worth while with respect to the Governments of
                            Costa Rica and Salvador. I replied by explaining the Department’s
                            position, as set forth in your circular telegram of January 31, 7 p.m.,
                            but said that nevertheless I would inform the Department of President
                            Ubico’s request.</p>

                        <p>19. Your 81, March 1, 6 p.m. It seems to us that the present situation in
                            Nicaragua should enhance Nicaragua’s interest in the Conference. If
                            preparations for the Conference on Nicaragua’s part can be hastened and
                            public attention directed thereto, this might well serve to exercise a
                            quieting effect on public opinion. Nicaragua took the initiative in
                            arranging for the Conference and issued the invitations to it, and
                            unless she goes ahead in an appropriate way with her preparations there
                            will obviously be little chance of holding a successful Conference. If
                            you see no objection you may express this as your own view to President
                            Sacasa.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the conversations which
                            you have had with officials of the Department concerning the approaching
                            Central American Conference, there is set forth hereinafter for your
                            information and guidance a statement of the policy of this Government
                            with relation to the Conference.</p>
                        <p>1) The principal concern of the Government of the United States with
                            respect to the Conference of Central American States is that the
                            Conference shall be a success, at least to the extent of continuing a
                            spirit of harmony and cooperation among the Central American States.</p>
                        <p>2) This Government is not a party to the Conference and for this and
                            other reasons will refrain from any participation or interference in its
                            proceedings, but, in line with our traditional policy of friendship with
                            the Central American countries, we will not withhold any informal aid
                            which may be welcome to the Conference and calculated to insure its
                            success.</p>
                        <p>3) The attitude of the Legation in Guatemala will be in conformity with
                            the foregoing. The Legation will keep the Department fully informed of
                            developments that may take place; special situations as they may arise
                            from time to time will be submitted for the Department’s consideration
                            and instructions.</p>
                        <p>4) While the Department cannot commit itself to accept for its guidance
                            any rule or principle for the recognition of governments in Central
                            America before such rule or principle has’ been agreed to by the Central
                            American Governments themselves, and fully considered by the United
                            States, it will view with sympathy any reasonable guide for recognition
                            to which all the Central American countries may agree and which promises
                            to encourage orderly, constitutional government, and a continuance of
                            friendly relations among them.</p>
                        <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0512"/>
                        <p>While the foregoing expresses the Department’s attitude it may not be
                            advisable to make it known to the delegates at the Conference. On the
                            contrary, it would seem more advisable to endeavor to satisfy inquiries
                            from them in this connection by a statement to the effect that any
                            expression of the views of this Government concerning a recognition
                            formula might be interpreted as an attempt to influence the
                            deliberations of the Conference, an interpretation which we desire to
                            avoid.</p>
                        <p>5) Regardless of what may be done in the matter of continuing a guide for
                            recognition, the Conference would make a contribution to the well-being
                            of Central America if it resulted in an agreement subscribed to by all
                            which would insure continued cooperation, a sense of responsibility for
                            the maintenance of stability, non-intervention in each others affairs,
                            et cetera. The United States would be very happy to see such a result
                            achieved.</p>
                        <p>6) As regards the aspiration towards Central American Union, the United
                            States conceives this to be fundamentally a Central American question,
                            but is not unsympathetic.</p>
                        <p>7) The Legation will be advised fully by cable in connection with the
                            question of American assistance for the Central American Highway

                        <p>84. Department’s 19, March 2, 2 p.m. The President told me this morning
                            that Nicaragua is vitally interested in the forthcoming Conference and
                            will lend every possible aid. He said that he is giving serious
                            consideration to the delegates whom he will send but that the present
                            political situation here had to be taken into serious consideration in
                            choosing the delegates. He said that it would be of interest to him to
                            know whom the delegates of the other countries are. I am sending the
                            following telegram to other Central American missions: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“President Sacasa told me this morning that he had not yet
                                    determined whom he will appoint as delegate to Central American

                                    Crisanto Sacasa, would be one of the delegates. Unsettled

                        <p>86. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this morning that while
                            his first reaction to the President’s proposal for postponement was
                            unfavorable he now considered postponement essential in <pb n="445"
                                xml:id="pg_445" facs="0515"/>order to afford time to reconcile, if
                            possible, what he termed the divergent views of Guatemala and Costa Rica
                            regarding the draft convention to be submitted to the Central American
                            states. He said that because of apparent hostility in Costa Rica towards
                            Nicaraguan Government he considers it essential that Nicaraguan
                            representative should proceed to San José and have frank comprehensive
                            talk with appropriate officials there. Repeated to Central American
                            missions.</p>

                        <p>22. Telegram from Managua, 86, March 5, 5 p.m. Foreign Minister informed
                            me this morning that a telegram was received last night from President
                            Sacasa suggesting postponement of Conference until the end of April but
                            that Guatemalan Government was replying that it was opposed to another
                            postponement and that it feels such action on the part of President
                            Sacasa would be considered a sign of weakness.</p>
                        <p>Referring to second paragraph of telegram under reference, in my opinion
                            Nicaraguan representative here gave President Sacasa a false impression
                            of Guatemalan reaction to killing of Sandino. Government circles and
                            entire press regarded him as little better than a bandit and, although
                            the manner of his death was considered unfortunate, his disappearance
                            from the scene is believed an excellent thing for Nicaragua. With the
                            possible exception of isolated opponents of Ubico and a few unorganized
                            students, public opinion shares the views of the Government and
                            press.…</p>

                        <p>22. Your 86, March 5, 5 p.m. We continue to feel, as stated in our 19,
                            March 2, 2 p.m., that it would be in the interest of Nicaragua itself to
                            avoid a further postponement of the Conference. We fully approve the
                            personal suggestions you made to Sacasa and see nothing inconsistent
                            with our hands off policy in your continuing in a personal capacity to
                            point out these considerations to Sacasa and his immediate advisers, if
                            you judge that such action would still be useful. In view, however, of
                            our policy of non-interference in matters relating to the Conference we
                            do not feel that we can with propriety express any official views in the
                            matter, notwithstanding our own opinion that a further postponement will
                            be unfortunate for Nicaragua and Central America in general.</p>

                            Guatemala and Nicaragua and in deference to Sacasa’s apparent political
                            difficulties, Honduran Government has considered it best to postpone
                            opening of Conference at Costa Rica [<hi rend="italic">Guatemala?</hi>]
                            until late in April and that Honduras will not appoint delegates for
                            these reasons. He said that there was little interest in the Conference,
                            that he did not believe it would accomplish anything beneficial for
                            Honduras unless a reciprocal trade treaty could be signed and ratified
                            by all five countries that would replace the present free trade treaty
                            between Honduras and Nicaragua and Honduras and Salvador, and he
                            believes that Honduras would be unwilling to sign any Central American
                            arbitration pact without reservation until Nicaragua abides by the <pb

                        <p>91. My 90, March 7, 1 a.m. When I saw the President last evening he told
                            me that he had received (1) a telegram from President Carías indicating
                            no objection on his part to postponement provided Sacasa considered it
                            necessary and (2) telegram from President Ubico to the effect that it
                            would not be possible again to postpone Conference.</p>
                        <p>Sacasa said that in his telegram proposing postponement he was unwilling
                            to admit that present unsettled situation (that is between the
                            Government and the Guardia) had prevented him from making the necessary
                            preparations. He said that yesterday Crisanto Sacasa had said that he
                            did not wish to be associated with a failure and that he considered it
                            impossible in the short time remaining for the Government to formulate a
                            definitive policy which would be fully understood by the delegates who
                            have not yet been appointed.</p>
                        <p>The President said that his personal view was that it would have been
                            advisable to send a personal representative to Costa Rica, El Salvador,
                            Honduras, and Guatemala, in the order named, in order to endeavor to
                            arrange an accord with them as to policy.</p>
                        <p>He said that in view, however, of Ubico’s telegram and of my personal
                            suggestions he had decided to withdraw from his position of advocating
                            postponement and had telegraphed President Ubico to this effect.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0518"/>
                        <p>He indicated that Nicaraguan delegation would leave by plane March 13 and
                            that there would now be insufficient time to send representatives to
                            other countries.</p>

                        <p>15. My telegram No. 12, March 6, 3 p.m. The Salvadoran delegation to the
                            Central American Conference left today by train for Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>Thus far nothing official has been published to indicate the nature of
                            the proposals which Salvador will present at the Conference.</p>
                        <p>In view of Department’s attitude as described in its circular telegram of
                            January 31, 7 p.m., I have made no endeavor to ascertain the Salvadoran
                            Government’s plans.</p>
                        <p>The appointment of Doctor Molina as chief of the delegation would
                            indicate that this Government is most interested in the economic
                            questions which may be brought up. It is believed that Salvador will
                            support proposals for the outlawing of war and promotion of peace and
                            harmony among the Central American states but will oppose strongly any
                            proposition providing for the withholding of recognition from
                            governments coming into power through revolution.</p>
                        <p>There has been a lack of enthusiasm here in favor of the Conference but
                            most men prominent in public life feel that new modified treaties should
                            be signed.</p>

                                from what he said amelioration of relations with Guatemala is the
                                one definite aim which he has in mind to be accomplished.)</item>

                            of 1923 and added that Costa Rica is especially obdurate on this

                        <p>28. Foreign Minister told me this morning that the Honduran delegates who
                            arrived at Guatemala Sunday last were instructed before leaving that
                            they may agree to a modified treaty of peace and amity if it provides
                            for some sanction when supreme power unconstitutionally assumed and
                            until any revolutionary movement is legalized in a constitutional manner
                            provided by law. This is similar to Ubico proposal. He also mentioned
                            that delegates will urge modification of present free trade convention
                            on the basis of free trade in products only that are not produced in the
                            importing countries.</p>

                                considers that such a provision implies the right of intervention of
                                one state in the internal affairs of another. He added that Salvador

                            the Isthmus. I avail myself of the opportunity to offer to Your

                        <p>31. Skinner-Klee told me this afternoon that the delegates of Costa Rica,
                            El Salvador and Honduras presented their observations concerning
                            President Ubico’s draft treaty of Central American fraternity to the
                            Conference this morning. He said that Costa Rica’s only objection is to
                            the free trade provision while El Salvador suggested minor changes and
                            proposed the inclusion of a provision for a kind of defensive alliance
                            among the Central American countries. He did not consider any of the
                            objections to be of great consequence. Nicaragua he said is ready to
                            accept the treaty in full, and has therefore presented no
                            observations.</p>
                        <p>The Conference agreed to consider the treaty article by article together
                            with the observations referred to and Skinner-Klee predicted that the
                            treaty will be signed within 2 weeks. He expects that the Conference
                            will then proceed to consider President Ubico’s draft general treaty of
                            peace and amity and that El Salvador and Costa Rica <pb n="454"
                                xml:id="pg_454" facs="0524"/>will present objections to the
                            provision in article 7 concerning the recognition of revolutionary

                        <p>34. Article 14 of the draft treaty presented to the Conference by the
                            Honduran delegation reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Arbitration shall be the only method for settling conflicts
                                    which may arise between the Central American states. They shall
                                    observe and fulfill with all their authority and efficacy the
                                    arbitral decisions which terminate controversies.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>When the subject of arbitration came up in the Conference yesterday the
                            Honduran delegation proposed that any agreement for compliance with
                            arbitral decisions should apply to existing arbitral decisions. The
                            Nicaraguan delegation objected insofar as this might apply to the award
                            of the King of Spain in the Nicaraguan-Honduran boundary dispute. The
                            debate on this point became acrimonious between the two delegations
                            mentioned and was terminated by the president of the Conference
                            adjourning the session. Subsequently a telegram was sent to the
                            President of Honduras suggesting that he might give his delegation
                            instructions which would terminate the controversy. Pending his reply an
                            excursion to Antigua was arranged for the delegation today.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has just given me the foregoing
                            information. He expressed the opinion that compliance with the proposal
                            of the Honduran delegation would be equivalent to converting the
                            Conference itself into a court for the settlement of the
                            Nicaraguan-Honduran boundary controversy, and that the proposal did not
                            have the support of the other delegations.</p>

                        <p>36. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has given me confidentially a copy
                            of a draft treaty of peace and friendship which he says the Honduran
                            delegation will present today or tomorrow. Article 7 of the draft
                            provides: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The contracting powers declare their absolute respect for the
                                    provisions of their respective political constitutions and
                                    recognize the form prescribed therein as the only legal form for
                                    the transmission of public power. Express recognition of
                                    governors is unnecessary; but each country may break off
                                    diplomatic communication in case the order of transmission of
                                    power is altered by a revolutionary movement, so long as the new
                                    situation has not been legalized by the respective
                                    constitutional procedure.”</p>

                                            Salazar also invoked it. We objected that Honduras
                                            signed it with reservations which we read. We have
                                            sustained our thesis with much prudence and tact in
                                            order not to specify any exceptional case of a closed
                                            matter. We said that the opinion of the other
                                            delegations will always merit profound respect but if
                                            our thesis is not accepted we will sign with
                                            reservations. Mr. Salazar suggested abolishing article
                                            14 and possibly 15 but made no motion to that

                            copy of a note from the Ecuadorian Minister in Lima relative to the
                            boundary negotiations between Peru and Ecuador and certain protocol
                            formalities involving a possible eventual transfer of negotiations to
                            Washington and arbitration by the President of the United States, with a
                            memorandum attached, both dated January 11, 1934, handed to me during
                            Secretary Hull’s visit at Lima<note n="2" xml:id="d560fn2">Mr. Hull was

                            who also gave me a duplicate copy which the Minister especially
                            requested be given to the Secretary. It was actually delivered to Mr.
                            Cumming for the Secretary by Mr. de Lambert of the Embassy staff on
                            January 11th.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it will doubtless be of interest to the Department to
                            hear that Dr. Polo stated to me, during a visit to the Foreign Office on
                            January 15th, that the negotiations with Ecuador were proceeding
                            satisfactorily. The Peruvian Foreign Minister mentioned that he had been
                            informed by the Ecuadorian Minister, with whom he had had a conversation
                            shortly before my visit, that the technical advisers who were to aid him
                            in the matter were on the point of embarking for Lima. Dr. Polo
                            expressed the feelings that the negotiations in Lima will be successful
                            and stated that the question of transferring the negotiations to
                            Washington will only arise in case the Lima negotiations fail and the
                            arbitration provided for in the Protocol requires the transfer of the
                            negotiations to Washington. He stated that he had that day instructed
                            the Peruvian Ambassador in Washington to get in touch with his
                            Ecuadorian colleague and simultaneously with him to approach our

                            viz: the transfer of the negotiations to Washington and the arbitration
                            of the President of the United States in case the Lima negotiations
                            fail.</p>

                        <p>I may add that the atmosphere here seems rather improved through the

                            Ecuador who are to aid the local Ecuadorian Minister in the

                            to Ponce–Castro Protocol, to send to Washington their respective
                            delegations to discuss in a friendly manner their boundary matter in
                            order that, if unable to fix a definitive line by common consent, they
                            may determine those zones which are reciprocally recognized as belonging
                            to each of the two parties as well as a zone to be submitted to the
                            arbitral decision of the President of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The notes from the Peruvian and Ecuadoran representatives go on to state
                            that, after receiving the desired permission from this Government and
                            while the respective delegations are being constituted in Washington,
                            the two Governments will proceed immediately to initiate negotiations in
                            Lima in order, if possible, to arrive at a fair and equitable agreement
                            regarding their boundary dispute.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me highly desirable that we offer to these two Governments
                            our friendly assistance in the manner requested in order that they may
                            arrive at a peaceful solution of their long standing controversy. I
                            therefore hope that you will agree that the request of the two
                            Governments should be granted. Should you coincide in this belief, I
                            feel sure that the Governments of Ecuador and Peru would be deeply
                            gratified should you consent to receive the Ambassador of Peru and the
                            Minister of Ecuador for a brief interview at the White House in order
                            that they may be advised by you that we are glad to comply with their
                            request and to express the hope of this Government that the negotiations
                            now commencing may meet with complete success. I am confident that this
                            personal expression of interest on your part would be greatly
                                appreciated.<note n="7" xml:id="d561fn7">A photostatic copy of this

                                1924, the Governments of Ecuador and Peru, in their desire to reach

                                Quito, by their respective representatives, a protocol according to
                                which the two Governments, with the assent of the United States of
                                America, would send their respective Delegations to Washington
                                amicably to discuss there the question of boundaries, in order that,
                                if they should not succeed in establishing a definitive line, they
                                might determine by common agreement the zones which are recognized
                                reciprocally by each of the two parties and the zone which would

                            <p>Further, His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Relations of Peru
                                invited, by a note of October 18, 1933, the Government of Ecuador,
                                through our Minister at Lima, to initiate direct negotiations
                                regarding the said boundary matter, in accordance with the Protocol
                                alluded to, and the Government of Ecuador accepted the said
                                invitation in a note of November 21, 1933, stating that it was well
                                to proceed to comply with the provisions of Art. 1 of the Protocol
                                mentioned, for which reason, in compliance with instructions from my
                                Government, I am requesting the assent of the Government of the
                                United States of America, so that in due time the Government of
                                Ecuador may send its Delegation to Washington to discuss the
                                boundary question amicably with the Delegation which the Republic of
                                Peru will send at the proper time, notifying Your Excellency that
                                without prejudice to what has been requested, and until the said
                                Delegations are organized at Washington, the two Governments are
                                going to proceed to negotiations at Lima immediately, to see if they
                                can reach a just and equitable settlement of their old boundary
                                dispute.</p>

                            Government and that of Peru, with a view to an equitable delineation of

                        <p>6. Some time ago the Department was advised by the Minister of Ecuador
                            merely as a matter of information that his Government had been informed
                            by the Minister of Brazil in Quito that the Brazilian Government
                            believed that no permanent solution of the boundary controversy between
                            Peru and Colombia could be found without taking into account the rights
                            of Ecuador in the Amazon region and that the Brazilian Government was
                            disposed to favor the participation of Ecuador in any final adjustment
                            of this problem.</p>
                        <p>On April 20 the Minister of Ecuador transmitted orally an official
                            instruction from his Government requesting the good offices of the
                            United States in obtaining the participation by Ecuador in the
                            negotiations now proceeding in Rio before any final agreement was
                            reached by Peru and Colombia. He has been informed that this Government
                            is not advised whether any definite agreement in principle has been
                            reached as yet between those two governments and that it is felt that
                            the injection of a new problem into the discussions at this moment might
                            merely serve to complicate the controversy and retard the solution we
                            all hope for. In a very general way the Minister has been further told
                            that we urgently desire a permanent and just and final settlement of
                            this boundary controversy as well as of all boundary controversies on
                            the continent, which have been responsible for so many tragic disputes
                            between the American republics, and that if at any time in the future
                            our friendly assistance can be offered in a manner which, in our
                            judgment, would be productive in furthering a permanent settlement of
                            this particular dispute, we would, of course, be glad to lend our aid
                            should such be agreeable to all of the nations involved in the
                            question.</p>

                        <p>The Ecuadoran Chargé d’Affaires, Dr. Carbo, came in, having been referred

                        <p>He said that he had instructions from his Government to inquire whether,
                            in view of the fact that President-elect Velasco Ibarra, of Ecuador, is
                            now in Lima for a few days, this Government would not send a message to
                            the President of Peru and also to President-elect Velasco Ibarra,
                            expressing the hope that advantage may be taken of Dr. Velasco Ibarra’s
                            presence in Lima to reach an agreement on the “whole question of
                            frontiers in the Amazon valley”. Dr. Carbo said that he believed it was

                            result of the Leticia settlement of last May; however, he said that if
                            this could not be done it would, of course, be helpful if Peru and
                            Ecuador could reach a direct agreement on their frontier.</p>
                        <p>I recalled that the Ecuadoran Government had sent a commission to Lima,
                            which had been there for some time, to negotiate regarding the frontier
                            matter, and asked what progress had been made. Dr. Carbo said that he
                            felt practically nothing had been accomplished since meetings had been
                            postponed at the request of the Peruvian Government pending a settlement
                            of the Leticia matter, and that Ecuador was encountering some resistance
                            in obtaining a resumption of the meetings now.</p>
                        <p>I said that we of course wanted to do everything we appropriately could
                            to be helpful in connection with these boundary disputes, provided that
                            both parties desired us to be of such assistance. I reminded him that
                            last February President Roosevelt had made a public statement<note

                            his consent to the request made by the Governments of Peru and Ecuador
                            that under the terms of the Ponce Castro Protocol between the two
                            countries of 1924, this Government consent to the sending of delegations
                            from the two countries to Washington to discuss the adjustment of their
                            frontier. I said that the matter was now under negotiation in Lima and
                            that we most sincerely hoped that the two Governments would come to an
                            agreement there. If they failed to do so there was then the possibility
                            that they would come to <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0535"

                            last February. I said that it seemed to me that for us to intervene now
                            with a suggestion that President Benavides and President-elect Velasco
                            Ibarra try to reach an agreement on the frontier might cause
                            misunderstanding and resentment and prove to be <hi rend="italic"
                                >contraproducente</hi>. I asked Dr. Carbo if he did not feel that
                            there was very real risk, if we should take any such action as had been
                            suggested, that it might turn out to have the very opposite effect of
                            what we all desired, namely, a satisfactory solution by mutual agreement
                            of this matter. Dr. Carbo said that he appreciated the force of what I
                            had said, that he agreed that there was this risk of causing
                            misunderstanding and resentment, and that he would report to his
                            Government what I had said.</p>

                                    >Supra.</hi></note> Dr. López, during his recent visit to
                            Washington, told me that the Colombian Government was entirely willing
                            that the Ecuadoran claims for territory and for an outlet to the Amazon
                            should be taken up before any final adjustment of the respective claims
                            in the Amazon region on the part of Brazil, Colombia and Peru. He said,
                            however, there were two practical difficulties. One was that the Leticia
                            agreement provided for direct negotiations between Peru and Colombia,
                            which would make it impossible in those negotiations to bring Ecuador
                            into the picture; second, that the Peruvian Government had definitely
                            stated to him that they would not agree to participation by Ecuador in
                            such discussions.</p>
                        <p>I remarked to Dr. López that it would seem the part of common sense that,
                            when an adjustment of the various claims for territory in the Amazon
                            headwaters region was disposed of, it be disposed of in an equitable and
                            permanent manner, and that I did not see how any satisfactory and
                            permanent solution could be found if Ecuador were completely
                            disregarded. If the latter course were followed, I said it seemed to me
                            that we would once more be confronted on this continent with a question
                            similar to the Tacna-Arica<note n="13" xml:id="d565fn13">See <ref

                            create a dangerous outbreak and which, pending such time, would

                            she would allege were her just rights. Dr. López said that he agreed
                            completely with this point of view and that we here might feel sure that
                            he would do everything possible to prevent the Government of Peru from
                            continuing in the course upon which they had embarked with regard to
                            Ecuador. I understood that he had discussed this matter very much the
                            same way with the President-Elect of Ecuador upon his recent visit to
                            Bogotá.</p>

                            forthcoming Central American Conference,<note n="2" xml:id="d566fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#pg_423">pp. 423</ref> ff.</note> to be held
                            probably in Guatemala City, for the various Republics of the Isthmus to
                            reach an agreement on plans for constructing their portion of the
                            Inter-American Highway. Among the items which the Guatemalan Foreign
                            Minister has confidentially told me that he intends to bring up at the
                            Conference is a proposal for cooperative action in highway development.
                            He favors unifying the national highway programs for the sake of greater
                            efficiency and in order to lay the foundations for one Central American
                            system with connecting links between the states. It would seem that the
                            Inter-American Highway should fall within the scope of any discussions
                            on highways at the Conference and that it should be specifically
                            mentioned in any agreement that may be reached on the subject.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, I have had no instructions as to encouraging the interest
                            of the Guatemalan Government in the Inter-American Highway project; nor
                            am I acquainted with any new plans that the American Government may have
                            made with respect to that enterprise. Under the circumstances I have not
                            felt that I could bring up the subject in my conversations with the
                            Foreign Minister; but I am of the opinion that he would be readily
                            responsive to any suggestions for advancing this project at the
                            Conference.</p>

                        <p>28. Octavio Beeche, Chargé of the Costa Rican delegation, in a
                            conversation with Lawton last night brought up the subject of the
                            Central American highway. He seemed to think it a noncontroversial
                            subject on which the Conference should be able to reach an agreement and
                            expressed interest in learning what assistance the United States might
                            give toward the construction of the highway. Lawton referred him to me.
                            The Minister of Foreign Affairs has expressed a similar interest to me
                            and I told him I might have something to communicate to him in the near
                            future.</p>

                        <p>30. My 25, March 13, 11 a.m., and 28, March 16, 11 a.m. In my
                            conversations with the delegates I am concurring with the view which has
                            been expressed that the present Conference furnishes an opportunity for
                            the Central American Governments to demonstrate their interest in the
                            inter-American highway by taking some positive action calculated to
                            expedite its construction through Central America. I have added that my
                            Government continues in its desire to be of assistance and have given as
                            my opinion that the extent and character of such further assistance it
                            might find possible to extend would depend Very largely upon the
                            interest displayed by the Central American Governments themselves.</p>
                        <p>I hope that the initiative in obtaining the further assistance of the
                            United States may thus come from the Central American Governments since
                            for us to express a willingness to furnish material assistance in
                            advance of any such initiative might lead to misinterpretation and
                            mistrust of our motives and might actually prejudice the chances of
                            completing the highway through Central America.</p>
                        <p>I hope I may be instructed to inform the delegates at an appropriate time
                            before the Conference closes of the character of the assistance <pb
                                n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0539"/>the United States is prepared
                            to extend to the Central American countries, but for the reasons given
                            herein I deem it desirable that until some positive action favoring the
                            construction of the highway is taken by the Conference I should limit my
                            observations to those outlined in the first paragraph above.</p>

                        <p>33. Costa Rica delegation called on me today and inquired whether the
                            Government of the United States would give material assistance towards
                            the construction of the Central American highway. Dr. Beeche said he had
                            instructions to present the subject of the highway to the Conference. I
                            discussed the matter with them in the sense set forth in my telegram No.
                            30, March 19, 6 p.m. Both delegates said that they considered the
                            furtherance of the highway project to be one of the most useful things
                            that the Conference could accomplish.</p>

                            portion of the route (between Panama and Mexico) for which the
                            reconnaissance survey and report have been made.</p>
                        <p>I am attaching a paragraph for the consideration of the State Department
                            which would simply provide the authority for the Secretary of
                            Agriculture to continue the surveys authorized under Public Resolution
                            No. 104 at the request and under the direction of the Secretary of
                            State, and to pay the cost from the administrative funds provided under
                            the Federal aid highway legislation. These funds are adequate to absorb
                            any additional costs without the necessity for an additional
                            authorization. The Secretary of Agriculture is in sympathy with the
                            project and agrees to this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>The paragraph attached would be germane to the subject matter of the
                            highway legislation now pending in the Senate, known as H. R. 8781.
                            Since it only provides authority to use funds now authorized, I think it
                            might properly be carried in the Deficiency Appropriation Measure.</p>

                                    of the Pan American Union, expressed its interest in the
                                    proposed Inter-American Highway, and in evidence of that
                                    interest has already defrayed most of the cost of a
                                    reconnaissance survey of the proposed route through Central

                            of Agriculture,<note n="7" xml:id="d577fn7">Not printed.</note> in which
                            he invites attention to the fact that Congress has recently appropriated
                            $1,000,000 to enable this Government to render assistance in connection
                            with the survey and construction of the proposed Inter-American Highway
                            and has authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to expend $75,000 in
                            continuing surveys already begun. The Acting Secretary of Agriculture
                            points out the desirability of enlisting the cooperation of the Mexican
                            Government in furtherance of the project and requests that an effort be
                            made to ascertain whether that Government would be interested in joining
                            the United States, the five Central American Governments and Panama in
                            reorganizing the Inter-American Highway Commission and in being

                        <p>You are accordingly requested to take up this matter with the Mexican
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs on the basis of the information contained
                            in the letter from the Department of Agriculture and request Dr. Puig to
                            advise you at as early a date as may be convenient of the Mexican
                            Government’s views in the premises. In case you deem it advisable to do
                            so, you may furnish Dr. Puig with a copy of Mr. Gregg’s letter. I am
                            hopeful that the Mexican Government may see its way clear to join in the
                            proposal to reorganize the Commission and be represented thereon and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that President
                            Sacasa spoke to me at some length yesterday about his aspirations for
                            extension and improvement of communications in Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>His most important topic of conversation was the proposed Inter-American
                            Highway. The President stated that he felt that this would be a bond of
                            the greatest value for the furtherance of real Pan Americanism, of which
                            he had ever been one of the most sincere and tireless exponents. He
                            said, however, that in studying the copy of the report on the
                            reconnaissance survey of the Inter-American Highway through Central
                            American countries delivered to his Government by the Legation (the
                            Department’s instruction No. 81 of May 28, 1934<note n="9"

                            that the proposed route through Nicaragua could be improved upon.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Sacasa remarked that he realized that the engineers who undertook
                            the survey had undoubtedly considered all possible routes carefully and
                            chosen that which seemed best to them with due consideration <pb n="474"
                                xml:id="pg_474" facs="0544"/>of all factors bearing on the
                            advisability of one location over another but that he thought undue
                            stress had probably been laid on ease of construction rather than the
                            opening up of regions now inadequately served by roads and railroads. He
                            pointed out that the route described in the report paralleled the
                            existing Pacific Railway and was consequently not as useful as another
                            might be.</p>
                        <p>He said that he hoped it would eventually be possible to locate the
                            Nicaraguan section of the highway so as to pass through Nandaime,
                            Jinotepe, Diriamba, Managua, Tipitapa, Matagalpa, Jinotega and Ocotal
                            instead of through Nandaime, Granada, Masaya, Managua, León and
                            Chinandega as contemplated in the reconnaissance report (It is believed
                            that these routes can be easily traced on maps in the Department’s
                            files). This would give two important portions of Nicaragua, the Sierra
                            coffee district south of Managua and, of greater moment, the
                            Matagalpa–Segovia region in which Sandino and his bands had operated,
                            adequate means of communication with the Managua–León–Granada center of
                            the Republic, the principal cities of which are now connected by rail,
                            whereas the suggested route would merely duplicate, for the most part,
                            existing rail facilities.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that the route he mentioned would not be
                            materially longer than that recommended by the reconnaissance survey
                            report, that, in his opinion the added cost entailed by the more
                            difficult nature of the terrain would be justified by the increased
                            benefits received, and that it would enable the placing of Tegucigalpa
                            on the main line of the Highway instead of on a feeder thereto as
                            contemplated by the report. He said that he felt the economic
                            development of the Segovias which would result from opening them up
                            would serve to do away with the poverty and ignorance which had made
                            that region such an easy prey to bandit movements; furthermore, the
                            existence of a modern highway through them to replace the difficult mule
                            trails by which they are now reached would make their control and
                            policing a simple matter.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious from Doctor Sacasa’s remarks that they were based on the
                            premise that a large share of the cost of the Highway would be borne by
                            the Government of the United States. He said that he had tried to get
                            funds to construct a satisfactory highway from Tipitapa to Matagalpa
                            since the beginning of his administration and had twice succeeded in
                            interesting American companies but that on each occasion a catastrophe,
                            the explosion of the arsenal at the Campo de Marte on August 1, 1933,
                            and the assassination of Sandino on February 21, 1934, and the resulting
                            political uncertainty had aroused their caution.</p>
                        <p>President Sacasa also spoke of his hopes that a railroad to connect
                            western Nicaragua with the Caribbean coast “where we have vast and
                            untouched resources” could be built at some time in the near future. <pb
                                n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0545"/>He stressed the need from the
                            Nicaraguan point of view of bringing that “remote region into intimate
                            contact with our culture” and remarked that unfortunately Nicaragua does
                            not have financial resources to make this dream a reality without aid.
                            The President stated that he hoped it might eventually be possible to
                            secure a loan in the New York market for the purpose although he gave no
                            indication that any <hi rend="italic">démarches</hi> to this end had
                            been undertaken.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Sacasa then mentioned the advantages which he thought such a
                            railroad would have for the United States in “giving it another means of
                            communication across Central America, since I realize that the
                            Nicaraguan Canal is probably not an immediate possibility in view of the
                            crisis.” He apparently did not take into consideration the fact that
                            there are already three transcontinental railroads in Central America,
                            in Panamá, Costa Rica and Guatemala. I consider the President’s ideas
                            concerning the proposed Atlantic Railway largely chimerical although
                            there seems to me to be much to be said for his thoughts in regard to
                            the location of the Nicaraguan section of the Inter-American
                            Highway.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Sacasa explained that he was doing his best with the limited
                            facilities at the Government’s disposal to improve and extend existing
                            roads. He referred in particular to plans for the building of a road
                            from Chinandega to Nacascolo, a port on the Estero Reál, leading into
                            the Gulf of Fonseca, which the Government intends to develop, and to
                            improvement of the Managua–Tipitapa road and other roads in the vicinity
                            of the capital. From my own observations, the latter efforts seem
                            largely ineffective as the “improvement” consists of filling in ruts
                            with soft dirt. As the roads have no proper bed or crown heavy rains
                            quickly make them again practically impassable.</p>

                            in regard to the reorganization of the Inter American Highway

                            August 24, 1934, I have the honor to report that in a conversation this
                            morning with the Foreign Minister, who has just returned from a ten
                            days’ leave of absence, he told me that, after consultation with the
                            President, he was authorized to say that the Mexican Government would
                            prefer not to take any action on the suggestion at this time. <pb
                                n="476" xml:id="pg_476" facs="0546"/>Doctor Puig explained that as
                            the project involved the expenditure of funds voted by the American
                            Congress, he felt that this presented a question which might more
                            suitably be left open for the administration of General Cárdenas. He
                            added that he was informing me of the attitude of the Mexican Government
                            informally and not in writing as he did not wish to take a public stand
                            on the matter which might embarrass Central American countries disposed
                            to agree to the reorganization of the Commission and to accept funds for
                            the execution of the survey.</p>
                        <p>Apparently the position taken by the Mexican Government is in a measure
                            attributable to national sensitiveness and not, I believe, to lack of
                            sympathy with the proposed Inter American Highway.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 146, of October 17,
                                1934,<note n="17" xml:id="d582fn17">See footnote 11, <ref
                                    target="#pg_476">p. 476</ref>.</note> in regard to the proposed
                            expenditure of funds appropriated by the Congress on June 18 and 19,
                            1934, respectively, for the continuation of the cooperative
                            reconnaissance surveys for a proposed Inter-American Highway and for the
                            survey and construction of this highway.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the Department’s instruction under reference I
                            addressed a note to the Nicaraguan Minister for Foreign Affairs under
                                <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0549"/>date of yesterday, setting
                            forth the substance of the instruction insofar as it concerned the
                            Nicaraguan Government, and delivered it in person. The Minister
                            expressed marked interest in the readiness of the Government of the
                            United States to continue cooperation on an increased scale in
                            connection with the proposed highway but did not make any comments of
                            note.</p>
                        <p>I also informed President Sacasa orally yesterday of the intentions of
                            the Government of the United States and of the limitations on the manner
                            in which the funds available will be expended. Doctor Sacasa also
                            expressed gratification but commented that “one million dollars
                            distributed over several countries will hardly be enough to more than
                            scratch the surface.” To this I replied that material and equipment to
                            that value carefully distributed would be of great assistance and reduce
                            in large measure the expenditures of cooperating countries which could
                            be concentrated in some measure on labor costs. The President then
                            remarked that this was, of course, true. It was my impression from
                            Doctor Sacasa’s statements that, unfortunately, he had previously shared
                            the erroneous idea of some of the local newspapers that the United
                            States would in effect pay the cost of the proposed highway in Nicaragua
                            (the Legation’s despatch No. 533, of October 9, 1914<note n="18"
                                xml:id="d582fn18">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>Doctor Sacasa said that he would be glad to give his personal attention
                            to the question of Nicaraguan cooperation in the instrument survey and
                            would immediately request the copy of the report on the reconnaissance
                            survey through Central American countries which was transmitted to the
                            Nicaraguan Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Legation on June 26, 1934,
                            in compliance with the Department’s instruction No. 81, of May 28,
                                1934,<note n="18" xml:id="d582fn19">Not printed.</note> in order
                            that he might once more study the route. His comments on this were,
                            however, quite different from those reported in the Legation’s despatch
                            No. 438, of August 29, 1934, when he suggested a relocation of the line
                            surveyed from the air. President Sacasa said that, in view of the
                            poverty of his Government and the comparatively small amount
                            appropriated by the Congress of the United States for construction
                            purposes, the original route through the western and southern plains of
                            Nicaragua seemed to him offhand more practicable than one through the
                            more difficult and mountainous country around Matagalpa and in the
                            Segovias although the latter would open up more country.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that it would be even better were
                            construction in Nicaragua to be restricted to the stretches from
                            Chinandeg to the Honduran border and from Granada to the Costa Rican
                            border as there is a railroad from Chinandega to Granada. Making <pb
                                n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0550"/>it clear that I had no
                            instructions on the point, I told the President that it was my
                            impression that the general intention in regard to the proposed
                            Inter-American Highway was that it should be purely a highway and not a
                            combination of highway and railroad and that, while I had not recently
                            studied the various recommendations made at recent Pan American
                            Conferences, I thought reference to them would show this to be the fact.
                            President Sacasa agreed that this was probably true and said that he
                            understood the logic of such a policy. He remarked parenthetically that
                            the Guatemalan Government had not yet furnished the Nicaraguan
                            Government with a copy of the document (<hi rend="italic">acta</hi>)
                            concerning the Inter-American Highway signed at the recent Central
                            American Conference in Guatemala City (the Legation’s despatch No. 332,
                            of July 17, 1934<note n="21" xml:id="d582fn21">Not printed.</note>) and
                            that he wondered whether there could be any ulterior motive behind this
                            failure.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Sacasa ended his comments on the question by assuring me that he
                            would have the Minister for Foreign Affairs advise me formally at the
                            earliest possible date whether the Nicaraguan Government was prepared to
                            accept the route laid down in the reconnaissance survey report with the
                            understanding, of course, that the line as shown in the report is not a
                            located line but is subject to deviations and revisions which might be
                            agreed to between the engineers in charge of the final instrument survey
                            and the engineers representing the Government of Nicaragua.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have received the
                            Acting Secretary’s letter of October 9, 1934,<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d583fn21">Not printed.</note> in which he suggests that
                            early steps be taken toward continuing beyond the Panama Canal the
                            cooperative reconnaissance surveys for the proposed Inter-American
                            Highway under Section 15 of the Act (Public No. 393, Seventy-third
                            Congress) approved June 18, 1934.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that this Act provides also that the fund, the expenditure of
                            which is authorized therein, may be used “for making location surveys”.
                            I am of the opinion that its expenditure as well as that of the fund of
                            $1,000,000 appropriated by the Act of June 19, 1934, should be confined
                            to the area north of the Panama Canal Zone, where <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0551"/>a reconnaissance survey of the proposed
                            route has already been completed.</p>
                        <p>Before assistance in the construction of a highway north of the Panama
                            Canal Zone can be given under the authorization contained in the Act of
                            June 19, cited, it will be necessary, of course, that the instrument
                            survey be completed, at least in those portions where assistance is to
                            be rendered. It is my understanding that the $75,000 which your
                            Department is authorized to expend would meet only a small part of the
                            cost of a complete survey of the Central American section.</p>
                        <p>From the point of view of our relations with the countries of Latin
                            America, also, I believe it preferable to confine assistance at this
                            time to the countries in which the reconnaissance survey has already
                            been completed.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons I have suggested, I prefer not to take at present the
                            suggested steps looking toward continuing the reconnaissance survey
                            beyond the Canal Zone.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Supplementing my despatch No. 396 of
                            October 25, 1934,<note n="22" xml:id="d584fn22">Not printed.</note> I
                            have the honor to report that in conversation with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs he informed me that President Ubico was pleased with the
                            Department’s offer of cooperation in building the Inter-American Highway
                            and desired to take advantage of it. He stated that he had asked the
                            Minister of Agriculture for his recommendation with regard to the route,
                            although he did not anticipate any desire on the part of the Government
                            of Guatemala to make more than minor changes.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said that this Government would be interested mainly in
                            road-building machinery and bridge material, and he seemed to be
                            interested in devising some practical procedure for starting work on the
                            Highway. I told him this might be facilitated and hastened if his
                            Government could submit some concrete proposal concerning what it is
                            prepared to do in the way of cooperation. He indicated the possibility
                            that there might be a desire here to commence operations on that section
                            of the Highway leading from Guatemala City to the Salvadoran frontier
                            rather than the section from the capital to the Mexican <pb n="482"
                                xml:id="pg_482" facs="0552"/>frontier. I told him that if this plan
                            or idea should develop his Government might wish to prepare a project
                            for carrying it out which would be the basis for a specific request for
                            the machinery and bridge material desired.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the foregoing, I venture to add that should the project
                            for the construction of the highway to the Salvadoran border materialize
                            it would be one which would be essentially beneficial to this country
                            and which might encourage the other governments of Central America to
                            take action upon the highways in these countries. Last April, just prior
                            to the rainy season, I made the trip from San Salvador to Guatemala City
                            by motor in about ten hours running time. I believe that, with the
                            building of bridges and a reasonable amount of improvement of the
                            roadbed and surface, the road would be opened to year-around traffic and
                            the time between the two capitals would be reduced to from six to seven
                            hours.</p>
                        <p>One of President Ubico’s special interests is the improvement of roads in
                            Guatemala and he as well as many local officials are rapidly becoming
                            conscious of the value of the tourist traffic. Approximately one hundred
                            tourists are landed at San José by each north and south bound vessel of
                            the Grace Line for a hurried visit to Antigua and Guatemala City. The
                            United Fruit Line is about to offer special inducements to increase its
                            tourist traffic through Puerto Barrios to the capital. The tourists
                            generally are highly satisfied with the experience and many of them
                            express regret that they cannot remain longer in the country. I feel
                            quite certain that if and when the road linking the capitals of El
                            Salvador and Guatemala is completed the number of tourists who would
                            visit the two countries, as well as remain in them a more appreciable
                            length of time than at present, would be greatly increased, and that
                            their visits would prove of value in furthering and cementing the
                            friendly sentiments which those countries now entertain for the United
                            States, and would be of great economic and social benefit to Guatemala
                            and El Salvador.</p>

                            translation of the note of the Foreign Minister in reply to my note No.
                            134 of October 22, 1934, wherein I transmitted to this Government the
                            instructions of the Department of State with reference to contemplated
                            assistance to countries which are cooperating in the construction of the
                            proposed highway.</p>
                        <p>The Department will observe that Mr. Gurdián acknowledges “the very great
                            importance” of the highway and anticipates the benefits which will
                            accrue from its construction. At the same time the Foreign Minister—and
                            his viewpoint is transmitted after conversations, to my knowledge, with
                            President Ricardo Jimenez and other officials of the Government—very
                            frankly points out the financial difficulties immediately confronting
                            actual construction. On this subject Mr. Gurdián says: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“…<note n="25" xml:id="d585fn25">Omission indicated in the
                                        original.</note> Costa Rica’s difficult situation has
                                    obliged my government to effect inevitable economies in its
                                    expenditures in order to avoid budgetary deficits, and to
                                    suspend, through a prior arrangement with its American and
                                    European creditors, the service on its foreign debt. Under these
                                    conditions, the country finds it impossible to assume new
                                    obligations, which according to the estimates of the cost of the
                                    Inter-American Highway in the country, would mean an increase of
                                    one hundred per cent in the external debt of Costa Rica.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This debt is now approximately twenty-four million dollars upon which no
                            interest is being paid, and upon which the resumption of interest
                            payments and amortization of principle is not even being discussed.</p>
                        <p>In an informal conversation with Señor Gurdián on October 22, the day I
                            personally presented the note embodying the Instruction No. 96 of the
                            Department, the Foreign Minister emphasized the financial difficulties
                            confronting construction and he asserted at that time that while the
                            Government is considering all possible solutions of the problem no
                            particular plan of financing up to now has been regarded as feasible. In
                            his conversation Mr. Gurdián said that the Government has considered the
                            revenues to be derived from increased gasoline taxes; from the granting
                            of a concession to an outside corporation for the construction of the
                            road; from proposed bond issues; from toll charges, et cetera, but no
                            plan up to now has been considered feasible.</p>
                        <p>In this connection may I direct the Department’s attention to the
                            estimated costs for the proposed highway in Volume 2 of the
                            Reconnaissance Surveys made under the direction of the Bureau of Public
                            Roads of the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
                        <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0554"/>
                        <p>These estimates contemplate the construction of 312.7 miles (503.2
                            kilometers) of road in Costa Rica.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>Table 19, planning merely the grading and surfacing of the road
                                with local materials and the construction of the necessary bridges,
                                estimates the cost at $11,145,206.25.</item>
                            <item>Table 20, contemplating the use of an oil surface, estimates the
                                cost at $11,516,693.85.</item>
                            <item>Table 21, contemplating the use of concrete and the construction
                                of a thoroughly modern highway in every respect, estimates the cost
                                at $25,907,156.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This is a sum, as I recall, greater than the estimated cost of
                            construction in any of the other Central American countries. May I point
                            out at this point that all of the new highway construction in Costa Rica
                            made with current revenue funds is of concrete and that this Government,
                            whether rightfully or wrongfully, is of the opinion that nothing but
                            concrete will survive the terrific downpours which are almost daily
                            occurrences during the eight and a half months of the annual rainy
                            season. It is also true that the United States Bureau of Public Roads
                            contemplates a 20-foot highway as the minimum width for safety and
                            anticipated traffic, whereas most of the present Costa Rican highway
                            construction is confined to the dangerously narrow width of 12 to 16
                            feet which makes it difficult for speeding cars to pass in safety.</p>
                        <p>The Department will agree, therefore, that the estimated cost of
                            $25,907,156, for a properly constructed highway in Costa Rica presents a
                            real problem to this country and one which the Government of a necessity
                            must consider regardless of its desire for the highway. As a matter of
                            fact, construction of a concrete highway through the mountainous terrain
                            of Costa Rica with all modern safety devices and with increased
                            utilities on curves, would unquestionably double Costa Rica’s national
                            debt.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand the report of the engineers properly emphasized the
                            great increase of Costa Rican wealth which would result from the
                            construction of the highway and I find myself in complete accord with
                            conclusions which hold that the highway will more than pay for itself
                            through the additional prosperity and the increase in agricultural and
                            economic resources which should result from the opening up of hundreds
                            of miles of territory north of San José toward the Nicaraguan border and
                            south of the capital in the direction of Panamá.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this view is not held by a sufficient number of Government
                            officials and leading citizens to stimulate a real public enthusiasm in
                            Costa Rica for the highway. In addition there exists the unquestioned
                            suspicion—and this feeling prevails in official as well as unofficial
                            circles—that the United States Government is keenly interested in <pb
                                n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0555"/>the proposed highway because of
                            its desire to further increase the defenses of the Panama Canal. An
                            important section of Costa Rican public opinion anticipates that
                            economic and political developments will some day force a war between
                            the United States and Japan and that the United States is pushing the
                            highway in order to have an overland means of transportation for our
                            troops. Even such an enlightened Costa Rican as President Ricardo
                            Jimenez has had this suspicion in the back of his mind.</p>
                        <p>The note of the Foreign Minister calls attention to the fact that the
                            survey as recommended by the United States engineers routes the highway
                            between the towns of Naranjo and Las Cañas (Plates Nos. 23, 24 and 25 of
                            Volume 2 of the Reconnaissance Survey) too closely parallel to the line
                            of the Government-owned Pacific Railroad, and would thereby create a
                            source of competition for the railroad. The Foreign Minister suggests
                            substitution of a different route, if technically possible, to eliminate
                            this proximity to the railroad. He does not, however, say that Costa
                            Rican engineers will be directed to make a new instrument survey to
                            discover a substitute route.</p>
                        <p>May I direct the Department’s attention also to this paragraph of Mr.
                            Gurdián’s note: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Having set forth the economic conditions of the country in
                                    relation to the great undertaking referred to in your note, my

                                    offered by the Government of the United States, and accepts it
                                    if Costa Rica is found to meet the situation which the American
                                    Congress had in view in passing the appropriation laws cited in
                                    the note under reply.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>By way of further exposition of the Costa Rican viewpoint may I call
                            attention to a recent letter by the editor of <hi rend="italic">El
                                Diario de Costa Rica</hi> to the Foreign News Editor of the
                            Associated Press, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d585fn26">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In accordance with the statement in the Department’s Instruction No. 96
                            to the effect that it will be glad to receive any recommendations I may
                            care to submit, which invitation I assume is inclusive of the entire
                            subject, may I respectfully offer the following thoughts;</p>
                        <p>First; I do not believe it will be advisable for the United States
                            Government at this time either directly or indirectly to appear to be
                            hurrying Costa Rica into a decision on the project which will involve a
                            great outlay of cash, or a further increase in the public debt.</p>
                        <p>Second; I feel that as the work progresses in other countries of Central
                            America and in Mexico that Costa Ricans of their own accord will come to
                            the conclusion that they are missing something and that they then will
                            manifest more interest in the project than at present and will show a
                            greater desire to participate in its proposed benefits. In other words,
                            I feel that the ultimate success of the project, insofar <pb n="486"
                                xml:id="pg_486" facs="0556"/>as Costa Rica is concerned, will be
                            greater if the decision to go forward is one that is dictated by a
                            genuine public and official enthusiasm, and at present no such
                            enthusiasm exists.</p>
                        <p>Third; I feel that it will be very inadvisable for the United States
                            Government at this time, and perhaps in the future, to assist directly
                            in the payment of the cost of construction other than is contemplated in
                            the acts of Congress referred to in Instruction No. 96.</p>
                        <p>Unquestionably there does prevail in Costa Rica a desire on the part of
                            many people, including land owners, for the very generous United States,
                            as an act of good neighborliness, to come along and say in effect:
                            “Don’t worry Costa Rica, we will build the road for you.” Nothing would
                            please some Costa Ricans better than this, but even if the United States
                            was so generously inclined there are sufficient politicians in the Costa
                            Rican Congress who would not only look such a gift horse in the mouth
                            but would denounce the alleged motives of the United States for such
                            generosity. In such a gesture the Nationalists would again visualize
                            “Yankee Imperialism”.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the only justification which might exist for the expenditure
                            by the United States Government in Costa Rica of a sum sufficiently
                            large to finance all or the greater part of the highway in this country,
                            would be the construction of a military highway wherein the ends would
                            justify the means and the question of cost would not be a factor. In
                            such an event the United States could then afford to turn a deaf ear to
                            the protests of the Nationalists, but otherwise I am confident our
                            motives would not be appreciated and would always be questioned.</p>
                        <p>Fourth; I do not believe it would be advisable for title United States to
                            make available to Costa Rica any portion of the funds or materials
                            contemplated in the acts of Congress until this Government of its own
                            accord negotiates or commences a definite instrument survey as a
                            substitute for that portion of the highway between the towns of Naranjo
                            and Las Cañas to which objection has been made.</p>
                        <p>Fifth; if and when the United States Government should ever extend
                            material assistance to the Government of Costa Rica, and if and
                            when,—should this be done—American capital is employed to assist in the
                            construction of the highway, I would stipulate that all materials
                            purchased and all scientific assistance employed be American.
                            Unfortunately, in the past Costa Rica has been know[n] to finance
                            construction projects with American money (electrification of the
                            Pacific Railroad) and turn right around and expend these dollars in
                            material and equipment purchased in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Sixth; in the light of Costa Rica’s present default on its outstanding
                            bonds, and in the light of the apparently indefinite date of resumption
                            of payments of interest on and amortization of these bonds, I feel that
                            the financing of this highway in Costa Rica by the sale of a bond issue
                            to American investors as has been suggested by some people, even if
                            permitted by the Department of State, would be a very risky and perhaps
                            dubious financial venture. I would suggest that if ever the day comes
                            when the Department feels inclined to favor the raising of funds in the
                            United States to finance this project, the transaction be hedged with
                            such restrictions that not only the security of the American investors
                            is assured but the self-respect of the United States Government be also
                            maintained in reference to inevitable subsequent outbursts of political
                            leaders.</p>
                        <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0557"/>
                        <p>In conclusion may I respectfully summarize my reactions to the Costa
                            Rican participation in the Inter-American Highway project based on
                            observations during my 13 months in Costa Rica, and they are that Costa
                            Rica will some day construct its sections of the Inter-American Highway
                            and thereby furnish a complete road from Laredo, Texas, to the “Panama
                            Canal but the impetus should be supplied by the Costa Ricans themselves
                            from the standpoint of their selfish economic interests, and that in no
                            way should the impression prevail that the “Yanquis of the North” are
                            forcing Costa Rica either to accept or to build the road.</p>
                        <p>The Department may feel, as a result of my conclusions, that I am not in
                            sympathy with the proposed construction of the Inter-American Highway.
                            If, unfortunately, this opinion should prevail may I enter a denial in
                            advance and say for the record that I not only visualize the actual
                            highway as the greatest prospective economic and cultural development
                            pending in Costa Rica but that I have neglected no occasion to
                            informally and properly convey my enthusiasm to officials of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I can not help but feel, however, that the United States Government will
                            make a great mistake if it appears in the light of a philanthropist
                            giving to Costa Rica a gift of all or part of the cost of construction
                            of this highway until such time as Costa Rica shows a determined spirit
                            of effective cooperation in the execution of the project which will
                            justify the financial aid of the United States Government in accordance
                            with the intent of the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                acknowledge receipt of your kind note No. 134, dated October 22nd,
                                last, in which you had the kindness to transcribe the text of the
                                laws voted by the Congress of the United States, and approved by His
                                Excellency President Roosevelt, authorizing disbursements to defray
                                the expenses which the President in his discretion may deem
                                necessary to cooperate with the several governments, members of the
                                Pan American Union, in the survey and construction of the proposed
                                Inter-American Highway, this expenditure being subject to the
                                receipt of assurances satisfactory to the President from such
                                governments, of their cooperation in the survey and construction
                                referred to. You add that your government is now considering the
                                places where these funds will be spent and the form of their
                                application in the work planned, with the intention of <pb n="488"

                                now carrying out or intend to initiate work on the highway, which
                                when completed will unite all the American countries. That for the
                                said purpose, the Government of the United States intends to donate
                                to the governments cooperating in the carrying out of the work,

                                to be acquired with the fund of one million dollars voted in the law
                                first referred to above.</p>
                            <p>Your government desires to know if the route marked out in the report
                                given to this government would be accepted by its engineers, and our
                                intentions toward initiation of the instrument survey of the road,
                                in order that my Government may take advantage of the generous offer
                                of the Government of the United States.</p>
                            <p>In reply, I have the honor to inform you that my Government, as much
                                as any other, is convinced of the very great importance of the
                                construction of the Inter-American Highway, which, uniting all the
                                sister nations, will permit the greatest intellectual and commercial
                                “rapprochement” between them, will facilitate a mutual acquaintance
                                and will strengthen the ties of sympathy now existing, at the same
                                time being a factor of great importance in the development of
                                agriculture, industry and commerce in each and every one of the
                                American countries. Nevertheless, Costa Rica’s difficult situation
                                has obliged my government to effect inevitable economies in its
                                expenditures in order to avoid budgetary deficits, and to suspend,
                                through a prior arrangement with its American and European
                                creditors, the service on its foreign debt. Under these conditions,
                                the country finds it impossible to assume new obligations, which
                                according to the estimates of the cost of the Inter-American Highway
                                in the country, would mean an increase of one hundred per cent in
                                the external debt of Costa Rica.</p>
                            <p>It is the firm intention of the Costa Rican Government to continue
                                carrying out a plan of highway construction in accordance with its
                                economic capacity, following the definitive route fixed for the
                                construction of the Inter-American Highway.</p>
                            <p>Having set forth the economic conditions of the country in relation
                                to the great undertaking referred to in your note, my government
                                expresses its thanks for the very valuable cooperation offered by
                                the Government of the United States, and accepts it if Costa Rica is
                                found to meet the situation which the American Congress had in view
                                in passing the appropriation laws cited in the note under reply.</p>
                            <p>The route planned for the highway in Costa Rican territory, according
                                to the plans submitted, holds for this government the obligation of
                                passing through places very near to the port of Puntarenas, and its
                                construction would mean that traffic between this point and San José
                                would go preferably over the highway, with serious prejudice to the
                                Pacific Railway, a public enterprise which represents a large
                                investment for the country.</p>
                            <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0559"/>
                            <p>For this reason I take the liberty of suggesting a change in the
                                highway route between the towns of Naranjo and Cañas at a distance
                                from the Pacific Railway line, and substituting for it, if
                                technically possible, a different route which would open up
                                magnificent areas to the north of the “Cordillera Central”.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 631 of October 17,
                                1934,<note n="30" xml:id="d587fn30">See footnote 11, <ref
                                    target="#pg_476">p. 476</ref>.</note> directing this Legation to
                            inform the Honduran Government of the appropriations made by the
                            Congress of the United States toward cooperation with other governments
                            in connection with the survey and construction of the proposed
                            Inter-American Highway and inviting recommendations as to the ways in
                            which these funds may be expended to the best advantage.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with this instruction, the Foreign Office has been advised
                            of these appropriations and the Legation has inquired whether the
                            Honduran Government will accept the route through Honduras laid down in
                            the reconnaissance survey report, a copy of which, in accordance with
                            the Department’s instruction of May 28, 1934,<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d587fn31">Not printed.</note> was furnished the Honduran
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>From a cursory study of the proposed highway in Honduras and the general
                            reaction to it here, I feel that the best recommendation would be for
                            the United States Government to carry out what the Department states it
                            intends doing, that is to expend the appropriations in the United States
                            for road building machinery and other equipment which could not be
                            purchased by Honduras but which is essential for the construction of
                            such a highway. The public interest felt in Honduras for the highway
                            cannot be called great, particularly as not more than ninety miles will
                            be through Honduran territory, and due to the present condition of the
                            finances, even were the interest greater, the appropriation of any funds
                            for materials is out of the question. The construction of an all weather
                            highway, eighteen feet wide, across swampy, low-lying territory with
                            numerous bridges and trestles made necessary by the broken nature of the
                            country is therefore impossible without abundant assistance in the way
                            of building materials and skilled engineers from outside sources.</p>
                        <p>This need for road building equipment of all kinds was explained to
                            Minister Lay by President Carías some eight months ago and it was
                            pointed out by him at that time that with such a contribution Honduras
                            would supply the labor which would expedite the building of the Honduran
                            section.</p>

                                        Mexico, Central America and Panama, especially to that part
                                        which refers to the Honduran section; and with the object of
                                        learning the opinion of our Government as to the most
                                        acceptable choice which said route should take in so far as
                                        it concerns our country, I have the honor to inform you that
                                        in the said study it is seen that the United States
                                        Commission contemplated two routes for the Honduran section:
                                        one that crosses the country from East to West passing
                                        through Tegucigalpa and the other Central Departments to the
                                        frontier of El Salvador and the other close to the Gulf of
                                        Fonseca, passing through the cities of Nacaome and
                                        Choluteca. This Ministry thinks that for reasons of a
                                        economic nature, we must consider as practicable only the
                                        Gulf route; a route which agrees in general terms with that
                                        recommended by our Department of Roads. In regard to the
                                        type of pavement, which includes the Highway to the South, I
                                        judge that the second type should be adopted, to which the
                                        report that we are discussing refers, or macadam with
                                        superficial oil treatment. With all consideration, I am,
                                        Very Sincerely Yours, (signed) Salvador Aguirre. To the
                                        Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Office.”</p>

                        <p>The object of the conference was to reach a decision between the
                            Departments of State and Agriculture regarding the next step to be taken
                            in extending the cooperation to be given by the United States in the
                            advancement of the Inter-American highway project.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the instrument survey through Central America should
                            be undertaken and that assistance in the form of bridges to be placed at
                            points along the route in Central America where they might be of
                            immediate use was desirable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MacDonald said that he was very anxious, however, not to go ahead
                            with the work contemplated until another effort had been made to bring
                            Mexico into the picture. He had recently returned from the Mexican
                            border and had the impression that there was a real desire on the part
                            of the Mexican highway officials for our assistance. He thought perhaps
                            an acceptance from Mexico of our proffered assistance might be better
                            obtained by working through the highway officials there than by making a
                            direct approach to the Mexican Government. Upon being asked whether or
                            not Mexico was not already doing all it could be expected to do and more
                            than any other Latin American country on the highway project, Mr.
                            MacDonald replied that this was true as far as the section between the
                            American border and Mexico City was concerned. There would be more
                            obstacles in the way of completing the route between Mexico City and the
                            Guatemalan border, however, and we should always remember that Mexico
                            has it within her power to prevent the completion of the highway by
                            failing to construct its southern section. For this reason he thought it
                            highly desirable that we get Mexico’s cooperation in the very
                            beginning.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles said that sounded highly reasonable and that he would begin by
                            speaking to the Mexican Ambassador on the subject the same
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MacDonald said he would also like to continue the Reconnaissance
                            Survey south of Panama. He said that the time element was always the
                            most important in executing such a project. If the Reconnaissance Survey
                            south of Panama is not undertaken now it will mean that the highway
                            project will be delayed by one or two more years. He would like to start
                            the Reconnaissance Survey right away and was certain that there was a
                            desire for the survey to be made on the parts of the South American
                            countries.</p>
                        <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson questioned the advisability of approaching the South American
                            Governments at this time. He suggested that in addition to the
                            desirability of concentrating the work to be done with the limited
                            amount of funds available in the Central American area where some
                            results of our work might become apparent, there was reason to doubt the
                            advisability of approaching Colombia, for example, the first country
                            south of Panama. He was not at all sure that Colombia wanted our
                            engineers down there at the present time. Mr. Welles said he saw no
                            reason why Colombia should object if Colombian engineers accompanied
                            American engineers. Mr. MacDonald agreed that it would be preferable
                            from his point of view if they did this.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles agreed that steps should be taken to extend our offer to
                            conduct a Reconnaissance Survey to the countries south of Panama. If all
                            countries did not accept, the survey could be made through those
                            countries accepting. At least it could be begun and Mr. MacDonald said
                            that he had received assurance from members of the next Congress that
                            additional funds for this survey would be made available, if needed. He
                            explained that no appropriations were necessary, that the Bureau of
                            Public Roads had an administrative fund which it was accumulating and
                            that all that was needed was an authorization to make expenditures out
                            of this fund.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed in conclusion that another approach would be made to
                            Mexico, that steps would be taken to offer to make a Reconnaissance
                            Survey in the countries south of Panama, and that until Mexico’s reply
                            had been received no work on the highway should be undertaken in Central
                            America.</p>

                            instruction No. 470 of August 24, 1934, and to your despatch No. 1805 of

                            reorganizing the Inter-American Highway Commission. In your despatch you

                            favorable response from the Mexican Government in order to accelerate
                            the development of this important project. The <pb n="494"

                            who promised to bring it to the attention of his Government after his

                                be followed by them in entering these countries. They have in some
                                instances approached the representatives of countries parties to the
                                Habana Convention with a view to having them take up directly with
                                their governments the matter of obtaining permission for American
                                aircraft to be flown to these countries. This procedure is not
                                required under the Convention.</p>
                            <p>The Department has refrained from taking up these cases through
                                diplomatic channels for the reason that under the terms of the
                                Habana Convention it is not required that the government of a
                                contracting state; shall make a request through diplomatic channels
                                for permission for such flights to be made over the territory of
                                another contracting state.</p>
                            <p>The Department desires to reach an understanding with the governments
                                of countries parties to the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation
                                by which it will be recognized that, in accordance with the clear
                                intention of the Convention, private American aircraft engaged in
                                pleasure or tourist flights may enter these countries and that
                                private aircraft of these countries making the same kind of flights
                                may enter the United States under the general authorization
                                contained in this Convention, subject to compliance with technical
                                requirements regarding entry and clearance and with the regulations
                                in force in the country to be visited, but without the necessity of
                                requesting for a flight formal permission through the diplomatic
                                mission <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0566"/>of the country
                                whose nationality the aircraft possesses or through the diplomatic
                                mission of the country to be visited.</p>
                            <p>It will be recalled that Article 4 of the Convention referred to
                                contemplates that each contracting state shall in time of peace
                                accord freedom of innocent passage above its territory to the
                                private aircraft of another contracting state. It has been the
                                general practice to incorporate a similar provision in all
                                multilateral or bilateral air navigation treaties or agreements.
                                Such a provision obviates the necessity for obtaining for aircraft
                                of a country which is a party to such treaty or agreement, special
                                authorization for flights to be made over the territory of another
                                country also a party to the treaty or agreement.</p>
                            <p>In view of the fact that the United States and Chile are parties to
                                the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation, the Department will be
                                glad to have you endeavor to reach an understanding with the Chilean
                                authorities to the effect that private aircraft of United States
                                registry making pleasure or tourist flights shall, under the general
                                authorization contained in the Habana Convention on Commercial
                                Aviation, be permitted to enter Chile subject to compliance with the
                                technical requirements of the Government of Chile regarding entry
                                and clearance and the laws and regulations in force in that country,
                                and that private aircraft of Chilean registry making pleasure or
                                tourist flights shall, under the general authorization contained in
                                the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation, be permitted to enter
                                the United States subject to compliance with similar requirements of
                                the Government of the United States and the laws and regulations in
                                force in this country, without the necessity in either case of
                                requesting through diplomatic channels that the flights be
                                authorized. If this course is found to be agreeable to the Chilean
                                Government, the Department will be glad to have you obtain from the
                                Chilean authorities, for communication to the Department, a
                                statement in duplicate outlining the requirements of the Government
                                of Chile concerning the entry and clearance of aircraft, and to
                                request that the appropriate Chilean authorities be notified of the
                                procedure agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>In connection with flights made in accordance with the provisions of
                                the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation, the Department
                                encloses copies in duplicate of Aeronautics Bulletin No. 7–C in
                                regard to requirements of different agencies of this Government
                                concerning the entry and clearance of aircraft. You may furnish a
                                copy of the bulletin to the Chilean authorities.</p>
                            <p>Aliens desiring to enter the United States should consult an American
                                consular officer in regard to the visa requirements for entry of
                                aliens into this country. Under the regulations of the Internal
                                Revenue Bureau, aliens are required to show before departing from
                                this country that they have paid any income taxes due this
                                Government <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0567"/>These matters
                                are not mentioned in the enclosed bulletin but should be called to
                                the attention of the Chilean authorities when the bulletin is
                                delivered to them.</p>
                            <p>The Department hopes that any requirements that may be imposed by the
                                Chilean authorities on the entry and clearance of aircraft will be
                                as simple as possible, in order that international flights between
                                the United States and Chile may not be impeded any more than is
                                necessary. Should you see no objection, you may make such discreet
                                use of this statement as may appear advisable.</p>
                            <p>As you are aware, an air navigation arrangement has been in force
                                between the United States and Canada since 1929.<note n="3"

                                this arrangement, the aircraft of each country are, subject to
                                compliance with the terms of the arrangement, permitted to enter the
                                other country without the necessity of obtaining formal permission
                                from the government of the country to be visited. In this respect
                                the arrangement is like the Habana Convention on Commercial
                                Aviation. The Department understands that the arrangement with
                                Canada has been very satisfactory in its operation. An arrangement
                                similar to the one with Canada has been concluded by this Government
                                with the governments of several European countries.</p>
                            <p>A similar instruction has been sent to the American diplomatic

                                also parties to the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation. The
                                Governments of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras,
                                Nicaragua and Panama have informed the Government of the United
                                States that they concur in the interpretation of the Habana
                                Convention on Commercial Aviation given in this instruction.</p>
                            <p>For your information, it may be stated that this Government does not
                                contemplate entering into formal agreements with the governments of

                                Convention itself. It merely desires to reach an understanding with
                                these governments in regard to the interpretation of the Convention
                                so far as concerns the right of private aircraft of one of the
                                parties to enter territory of the other parties on pleasure or
                                tourist flights without the necessity of obtaining an authorization

                                the interpretation of the Convention on Commercial Aviation adopted
                                at Havana on February 20, 1928, so far as concerns the right of
                                private aircraft of one of the parties to enter the territory of the
                                other parties on pleasure or tourist flights without the necessity

                                    courteous note, No. 138 of August 28th last, in which the
                                    Embassy referred to the interpretation which the Government of
                                    the United States of America had given to the Convention on
                                    Commercial Aviation signed at Havana on February 20, 1928, I
                                    have pleasure in informing you that the competent national
                                    authorities are in accord with the interpretation given that

                                Legation under date of September 9, 1933, informed the Guatemalan
                                Government of the Department’s interpretation of Article IV as
                                defined in the instruction under reference. The Ministry for Foreign
                                Affairs by a note dated September 23, 1933, informed the Legation
                                that the question had been referred to the competent authorities for
                                consideration and the submission of data in the premises.</p>
                            <p>During the past few months I have reminded the Minister for Foreign
                                    Affairs<note n="8" xml:id="d592fn8">Alfredo Skinner-Klee.</note>
                                that we have been making little or no progress in reaching an
                                understanding concerning the interpretation of Article IV of the
                                Convention. I saw him again this morning at the Ministry and took up
                                the subject with him in more detail and with somewhat more
                                insistence.</p>
                            <p>I pointed out once more that it is not the intention of the
                                Government of the United States to insist upon any procedure which
                                would render it difficult for the Government of Guatemala to
                                maintain a check upon the entry of foreign aircraft, but that it
                                would seem that a method of obviating such difficulty is embraced in
                                the Legation’s note in this connection based on the Department’s
                                instruction under reference in which it was stated that we would not
                                be disposed to raise any question with respect to a requirement of
                                Guatemala that in the case of civil aircraft entering Guatemala the
                                aviator must obtain clearance from a Guatemalan consular officer
                                provided, of course, that the aviator should not be required to
                                obtain through the Consul a special authorization from the
                                Government of Guatamala to enter Guatemalan territory. I told the
                                Minister that this requirement would appear to <pb n="500"
                                    xml:id="pg_500" facs="0570"/>give this Government, acting
                                through its consular officers, the control it desires in order to
                                maintain a check upon the entry of foreign aircraft coming from
                                neighboring countries. The Minister appeared to agree with me on
                                this point.</p>
                            <p>I judged from what the Minister told me that the Ministry of Fomento
                                has not yet given up its contention that the Habana Convention may
                                be interpreted as not applying to private aircraft, and I invited
                                his attention again to the Department’s analysis of the Convention
                                in support of the contrary view. I told him, moreover, that I had
                                served on the Committee which drafted the Habana Convention and that
                                I have a very definite and clear recollection that the discussions
                                in the Committee clearly established the intention of the Convention
                                as interpreted by the Department. The Minister did not appear to be
                                in full accord with the opinion of the Ministry of Fomento.</p>
                            <p>Licenciado Skinner Klee told me that another matter that is worrying
                                him somewhat in this connection is the desire of the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Lineas Aereas Occidentales</hi> to obtain
                                permission of this Government to carry passengers, mail and express
                                into Guatemala. This subject was reported upon in the Weekly
                                Economic Report of the Consulate General of June 25 of this
                                    year.<note n="9" xml:id="d592fn9">Not found in Department
                                    files.</note> It was pointed out in that report that the <hi
                                    rend="italic">Lineas Occidentales</hi> are owned by the “Varney
                                Speed Lines” which I understand to be an American Company now
                                operating between the United States and Mexico. Licenciado Skinner
                                Klee is opposed to an extension of this service into Guatemala in
                                competition with the Pan American Airways. His position appears to
                                be that under existing circumstances the most advantageous aerial
                                service for Guatemala as well as for this entire region is to be had
                                through protecting the Pan American Airways from competition for the
                                time being. He seemed to think that the acceptance by this
                                Government of the Department’s interpretation of Article IV of the
                                Habana Convention might force this Government to grant entry to the
                                    <hi rend="italic">Lineas Occidentales.</hi></p>
                            <p>Finally, the Minister told me he would not delay longer in taking up
                                the matter more vigorously and he held out the hope that it might be
                                arranged along the lines suggested by the Department. I shall not
                                fail to follow the question closely and to report further
                                developments to the Department.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                                have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the Government of
                                Guatemala is in accord, in part, with the interpretation that the

                                previous official permission; but subjecting themselves to the laws
                                and regulations in force in each country concerning passage over its
                                territory or landing thereon or landing on its waters; and to give
                                advice in writing and before making the flight to the Legation or
                                Consulate nearest the place from which such flight is begun and

                                transmitted with your despatch, reference is made to the conditions
                                under which commercial aircraft operated by companies may enter
                                Guatemalan territory. The Department desires to have you make it
                                clear that in taking up with the Guatemalan Government the matter of
                                obtaining an interpretation of Article 4 of the Habana Convention on
                                Commercial Aviation, the Department had in mind the necessity of
                                reaching an understanding with the Guatemalan Government with
                                respect to rights of entry so far as pleasure or touring aircraft
                                are concerned. This Government has no desire at this time to go into
                                the question as to what may be the status of aircraft engaged in
                                international commerce, and so far as it can see, nothing has arisen
                                to require consideration of this point. It is believed that any
                                discussion of commercial aircraft would only tend to confuse the
                                issue and complicate the discussion now under way in an effort to
                                reach an understanding concerning the right of entry of pleasure or
                                tourist aircraft.</p>
                            <p>The Department understands from the note which you have received from
                                the Foreign Office that the Guatemalan Government now agrees that it
                                is not necessary for an aviator to request formal authorization for
                                permission to enter Guatemalan territory under the terms of the
                                Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation. While the Department is
                                pleased to note that progress has been made in efforts to reach an
                                understanding with Guatemalan authorities, it regrets that the
                                Guatemalan Government has stipulated that advance notice of each
                                flight must be given by air mail ten days prior to making the flight
                                and by radiogram five days prior to the date of the flight. It is
                                believed that a requirement that Guatemalan consular officers must
                                be notified ten days in advance of the flight would work a
                                considerable hardship on the aviator as it might mean a serious
                                delay in his plans for a flight over Guatemalan territory. Leaving
                                the aviator uncertain during this period as to the attitude of the
                                Guatemalan authorities concerning the flight might even be found to
                                be tantamount to requiring him to obtain special authorization for
                                the flight, which is not required under the Convention. The object
                                of the Convention was to facilitate air traffic <pb n="503"
                                    xml:id="pg_503" facs="0573"/>among the contracting states, and
                                it would therefore be unfortunate if the Guatemalan Government
                                should insist upon a requirement that may to a great extent impede
                                such traffic.</p>
                            <p>The requirement proposed by the Guatemalan Government would seem to
                                be especially onerous so far as the aviator is concerned, for the
                                reason that he would be required to send two separate notices to the
                                Guatemalan consular officer, and by a form of communication which
                                the aviator may find to a great extent to be impracticable. It is
                                suggested in this connection that as the aviator would probably be
                                desirous of leaving on his trip as soon as possible, the Guatemalan
                                Government would not be inconvenienced should it leave the method of
                                communication with the consular officer to the judgment of the
                                aviator.</p>
                            <p>It is the apparent desire of the Guatemalan authorities to guard
                                against the entry of undesirable persons. It is suggested that this
                                might be considered an immigration question. You may, in your
                                discretion, state informally that the Convention, while according a
                                general right of entry, does not interfere with the right of a
                                contracting party to enforce its immigration requirements. You may
                                in this connection call attention to the last paragraph of Article
                                18 of the Convention, which reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“… the aircraft, aircraft commander, crew, passengers and
                                        cargo shall be subject to such immigration, emigration,
                                        customs, police, quarantine or sanitary inspection as the
                                        duly authorized representatives of the subjacent state may
                                        make in accordance with its laws.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The paragraph quoted would seem to relate to aircraft that have
                                entered the territory of a contracting state. However, as indicated
                                in its instruction No. 296 of August 25, 1933,<note n="13"
                                    xml:id="d594fn13"><ref target="frus1933v04#pg_620"><hi

                                Department is not disposed to raise any question with respect to any
                                reasonable requirement of the Guatemalan Government that the aviator
                                get in touch with a Guatemalan consular officer prior to departure
                                for Guatemalan territory. It is understood that under the Guatemalan
                                regulations, a passport and visa are not required for a stay of one
                                month or less in Guatemala and that instead, a tourist card is
                                issued without fee by a Guatemalan consul. You may, in this
                                connection, suggest informally in your discussions with the
                                Guatemalan authorities that they may desire to consider the adoption
                                of a form of tourist or identification card applicable to aviators
                                entering Guatemala on tourist or pleasure flights under the Habana
                                Convention on Commercial Aviation. Such a card, it is suggested,
                                might contain data supplied by the aviator and be signed by the
                                Guatemalan consular officer. Such a document should not, however, be
                                regarded as an <hi rend="italic">entry permit</hi> in the sense that
                                the aviator would be considered to be obtaining special
                                authorization to enter Guatemala and should not place a limitation
                                on the length of stay of <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0574"
                                />the airplane in Guatemala in view of the fact that the Habana
                                Convention on Commercial Aviation provides for the entry of aircraft
                                without imposing any limitation on the period in which the aircraft
                                is to remain in the country entered. If the tourist or
                                identification card should not be issued by the Guatemalan consul to
                                the aviator as soon as the consul received the data from the aviator
                                and there should be unnecessary delay in the matter, such delay
                                would, in the Department’s opinion, be apt to cause serious
                                interference with the plans of the aviator and tend to impede
                                international air navigation, particularly in view of the fact that
                                there would doubtless be many cases where the aviator would be
                                residing at a considerable distance from the place where the
                                Guatemalan consular officer is stationed. It is suggested, in this
                                connection, that the Guatemalan Government may be willing to
                                consider that a telegram sent by the Guatemalan consul to the
                                aviator would answer the purpose of a tourist or identification card
                                when the aviator desires to enter Guatemala on short notice.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the statements of the Foreign Office concerning
                                commercial flights by companies under the terms of the Habana
                                Convention on Commercial Aviation, the Department is glad to make
                                the following comment for the information of the Legation but not
                                for communication to the Guatemalan Government.</p>

                                state or states in which the lines are to be operated. A similar
                                provision has generally been incorporated in bilateral air
                                navigation agreements.</p>
                            <p>It is not stated in the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation,
                                also a multilateral agreement, that permission must be obtained by a
                                contracting state for its air transport companies to operate regular
                                air routes over the territory of other contracting states. It was
                                undoubtedly the intention of the framers of the Convention to
                                encourage and facilitate as much as possible the establishment and
                                operation of international air transport lines over the territories
                                of the contracting states, and it seems to be reasonable to consider
                                that the Habana Convention was designed to further a general
                                international obligation to admit such enterprises. However, from a

                                    which an airplane registered in the United States would have
                                    permission by virtue of the general authorization contained in

                                    registered in Haiti will have permission by virtue of the
                                    general authorization contained in the Havana Convention on
                                    Commercial Aviation, to enter the United States, submitting to
                                    similar conditions of the United States Government and to the
                                    laws in force in that country, without making it necessary, in

                                the Foreign Office dated May 24, 1934, on this subject, transcribing
                                the views of the Ministry of Communications, in which the suggestion
                                is made that in order to regulate private flights of an
                                international character the most practicable means is to conclude an
                                economic agreement between the two Governments which shall result in
                                the publication by each country of identic regulations, this
                                procedure being suggested in order to avoid a delay inherent in the
                                conclusion of a convention or treaty.</p>
                            <p>The Mexican Foreign Office in its letter states that it will be glad
                                to receive the opinion of the United States Government in the

                                        <p>“The provisions of the Pan American Convention on
                                            Commercial Aviation refer to and are applicable only to
                                            the regulation of international aerial commercial
                                            traffic.—As regards countries with whom Mexico has not
                                            concluded Conventions or Treaties relative to
                                            international aerial commerce, as well as in regard to
                                            internal aerial commerce and private aviation, the
                                            precepts of the Law of General Lines of Communication
                                            are applicable.—So that there are no provisions covering
                                            pleasure or touring flights, nor private flights of a
                                            business or other nature which may be made across the
                                            American border, flights which should be classified as
                                            private flights of an international character; and
                                            therefore, in order to set the procedure which should be
                                            followed in these cases, it is indispensable to
                                            legislate in the matter, the most practical means being
                                            to conclude an economic agreement between the two
                                            Governments which shall result in the publication in
                                            each country of identic regulations, so as to avoid
                                            having to conclude a Convention or Treaty, since the
                                            latter course would cause a great loss of time.”</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received the
                                Legation’s despatch No. 1468 of June 1, 1934, in further relation to
                                the interpretation of Article IV of the Habana Convention on
                                Commercial Aviation.</p>
                            <p>You transmit a copy of a communication dated May 24, from the Foreign
                                Office expressing the view that the Habana Convention on Commercial
                                Aviation applies only to the regulation of international aerial
                                commercial traffic, and proposing that an agreement be concluded
                                between the United States and Mexico regulating noncommercial
                                flights by aircraft between the United States and Mexico.</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States does not agree with the view
                                expressed by the Foreign Office that the convention referred to
                                applies only to commercial traffic. It is believed the texts of
                                Articles II and III of the convention clearly show that the view of
                                the Foreign Office is not correct. These articles are as follows:

                            <p>It is believed to be clear from the text of Article III, taken in
                                connection with Article II, that the convention applies to all
                                aircraft except military, naval, customs, and police aircraft.</p>

                                the convention.</p>
                            <p>A special agreement with Mexico regarding the entry of aircraft would
                                be unnecessary, in the estimation of this Government, in view of the

                                be inconsistent with the action taken by this Government in reaching
                                an understanding regarding the interpretation of the convention with
                                the Governments of Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Honduras,
                                Nicaragua and Panama.</p>
                            <p>The Department is especially desirous of reaching an understanding
                                with the Mexican Government at this time concerning pleasure or
                                tourist flights. It would, therefore, have no objection to an
                                exchange of notes between the Embassy and the Foreign Office,
                                interpretive of the Habana Convention on Commercial Aviation, in
                                which it would be stated that, subject to compliance with technical
                                requirements as to entry and clearance and laws and regulations in
                                force in the country to be visited, pleasure or tourist aircraft of
                                each country will be permitted to enter the other country without

                                the Government of the country to which the flight is to be made.</p>

                        <p>The Argentine Ambassador<note n="2" xml:id="d598fn2">Felipe A.
                                Espil.</note> called to inquire about possibilities of progress in
                            the reciprocal commercial treaty negotiations between his Government and
                            that of the United States. I told him that many of us here were much
                            more anxious to liberalize, if possible, commercial policy and to
                            restore international trade than any other government in this
                            Hemisphere; that I had not neglected the slightest chance to advance
                            such general program since my return from South America; that mine along
                            with other countries had practically gone wild in the practice of
                            extreme economic nationalism and isolation, and a vast amount of blind
                            or selfish sentiment had been created in its support. I stated that time
                            and patience were really necessary on the part of all Governments
                            interested; that we might make more rapid progress from time to time
                            than was expected, or progress might be slower than was expected; but
                            that we should continue in every possible way to advance this policy and
                            program. I told the Ambassador we were hoping that soon the President
                            would ask Congress for authority to negotiate and place in operation the
                            proposed reciprocal commercial treaties without ratification by the
                            Senate.</p>

                            desires of the Argentine Government regarding modifications in the

                                facs="0581"/>in the United States. Studies have been made of these
                            proposals by the competent agencies of this Government and the
                            conclusion has been reached that it will probably be possible to go
                            sufficiently far in meeting the desires of the Argentine Government to
                            permit the negotiation of a trade agreement which will be mutually
                            advantageous to the two countries.</p>
                        <p>It is regretted that a reply to the Embassy’s memorandum of October 5 has
                            been delayed so long. The delay has seemed unavoidable owing to the
                            necessity of moving forward upon a new commercial policy, securing the
                            necessary legislation to make this possible, formulating a comprehensive
                            program based upon this policy and studying the special problems of
                            Argentine trade in the light of this new program.</p>
                        <p>The competitive nature of the Argentine export trade as compared with
                            production in the United States renders the problems raised by a trade
                            agreement between the two countries more complex and difficult than is
                            the case with many other countries; and it therefore seems wise to defer
                            the commencing of active negotiation until additional time can be given
                            to study every phase of the situation in the greatest possible detail in
                            order to make certain of a favorable outcome to the negotiations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the general
                            subject of exchange operations between the United States and Argentina,
                            a subject with which the Department is already well and wearisomely
                            familiar, and in this connection to attach an enlightening memorandum
                            relating thereto prepared by Dr. Dye, the Commercial Attaché of the
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Dye’s statements are thought pretty well to cover the subject in its
                            present aspects and to leave little to be said. However, I venture to
                            refer to my despatch No. 77 of November 2, 1933,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d600fn6">Not printed.</note> in which I quoted the then
                            opinion of a prominent American business man in which, <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0582"/>referring to the old Exchange
                            Commission, he said that there could be no doubt that discrimination was
                            being practised against American importers to Argentina but that he felt
                            this was a policy originating in the highest government circle.</p>
                        <p>The opinion cited is thought to be eminently true today; in other words,
                            the existing Exchange Commission in its discriminatory attitude toward
                            American exporters to Argentina but echoes instructions given it by the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Dye’s report synthesizes a condition of such gravity as to warrant
                            and to counsel a firm attitude on the part of our Government, and in all
                            the circumstances I am wondering if this might not primarily be
                            manifested toward the Argentine diplomatic representative at Washington,
                            or at least concurrently with any steps to be taken here, preferably the
                            former. I incline to this preference in view of the fact that Argentine
                            exports to the United States have more than doubled during the past year
                            and have an increasingly upward tendency, while any pressure brought by
                            exchange restrictions here against American imports into Argentina might
                            lead to counter restrictions there tending to slow down this increasing
                            tendency in the northward movement of Argentine products.</p>

                            <p>Importers of American products in Argentina are experiencing
                                increasing difficulties in securing dollar exchange to pay for their
                                imports. The evidence seems conclusive that the Argentine
                                Government, through the Minister of Finance, has issued instructions
                                to the Exchange Control Commission to allow import permits for
                                American goods only to the extent to which dollar exchange is
                                provided by Argentine exports to the United States.</p>
                            <p>There is also apparent a marked tendency in the Exchange Control
                                Commission to influence importers to purchase in Europe any goods
                                which can be supplied from Europe instead of the United States.</p>
                            <p>Among concrete evidences upon which the above statement is based are
                                a personal conversation which I had with the Argentine Minister of
                                Agriculture, Luis Duhau, on an occasion recently when he asked me to
                                come and see him with regard to wine shipments to the United States.
                                In the course of discussing the question of wine, I asked him if
                                they had settled on the policy of giving exchange to the United
                                States only in proportion to the amount of Argentine products sold
                                to the United States and his reply was: “Yes, we are automatically
                                    <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0583"/>forced to that position
                                by the requests of other countries who demand under the ‘most
                                favored nation’ clause the same treatment we are giving to Great
                                Britain under the Roca Agreement”.<note n="7" xml:id="d600fn7">For
                                    representations of the United States regarding this agreement,

                                        pp. 722</ref> ff.</note>. I called his attention to the fact
                                that Argentine exports to the United States the past year had
                                increased over 100 per cent and his reply was: “Yes, that is true,
                                but the trade is still on a very low level as compared to our trade
                                with Europe.”</p>
                            <p>On January 31, 1933, Mr. Norman G. Buxton, General Manager of the
                                Otis Elevator Company in Buenos Aires, came to me and protested with
                                some vehemence against the attitude of the Exchange Control
                                Commission and told me that he had asked for import permits for Otis
                                elevators and for the steel rope, sheeting, oil and other
                                accessories, which go with Otis elevators. The Exchange Control
                                Commission had granted his request for the importation of the
                                elevators but had told him quite frankly that they would not give
                                him permits for the rope, oil, etc., and gave as a reason that he
                                could buy that in Europe. He stated that he wished to import these
                                from his own company and that he would not want to import these
                                products from Europe but he was told that the above instructions
                                came direct from the Minister of Finance and that if he did not like
                                it, he could go and talk to the Minister of Finance. The attitude of
                                the Exchange Control Commission as given to Mr. Buxton was that they
                                would give permits for only the absolute necessities which had to
                                come from the United States but that everything else would be
                                diverted to Europe as far as possible. Mr. Buxton is an English
                                subject, is a fellow member of the Rotary Club and I believe that
                                his statement is correct as given to me.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Henry L. Jones, Manager of the Latin American Department of the
                                U. S. Steel Products Company, 30 Church Street, New York, is now in
                                Buenos Aires investigating the question of exchange for his company.
                                He tells me that it is practically impossible for the U. S. Steel
                                Products Co. to get any exchange. His local manager has been advised
                                by the Exchange Control Commission along the same lines as reported
                                by Mr. Buxton. In view of the fact that the U. S. Steel Products
                                Co., furnishes large quantities of steel to a number of Government
                                departments, Mr. Jones has asked for an interview with the Minister
                                of Finance, at which he has asked him definitely for his position
                                with regard to exchange. The Minister of Finance has stated that he
                                wants to prepare the answers to Mr. Jones’ questions in writing as
                                he wishes to consider them very carefully before making a reply. Mr.
                                Jones has promised to give me the result of his interview with the

                            <p>As further specific evidence, I enclose herewith a memorandum<note
                                    n="9" xml:id="d600fn8">Not printed.</note> of a conversation
                                between the Under Secretary of Agriculture, Dr. Carlos Brebbia, and
                                Mr. Charles Waterman, representing the firm of E. Waterman &amp; Co.
                                of New York. This memorandum was dictated personally by Mr. Waterman
                                to my secretary in this office.</p>
                            <p>I also enclose copy of a letter received from F. Plata y Plata, La
                                Rural 176, Buenos Aires,<note n="9" xml:id="d600fn9">Not
                                    printed.</note> from which you will note that this company,
                                which represents the Albemarle Paper Mfg. Co., of Richmond, Va.,
                                have practically been forced to suspend imports of blotting paper
                                due to inability to get exchange; that they have hitherto supplied
                                about 75 per cent of the general consumption with this brand of
                                blotting paper.</p>
                            <p>These specific instances quoted are merely samples of urgent appeals
                                which are made to this office daily to intervene to try to secure
                                more exchange for importers of American products.</p>
                            <p>For practical purposes, it may be stated that the market for foreign
                                exchange consists of two categories:</p>
                            <p>The first consists of all the exchange which is supplied by the
                                export of Argentine produce. This exchange is sold to Argentine
                                importers at a rate fixed daily by the Exchange Control Commission
                                based on competitive bids received the day before. However, there
                                are some exceptions in that markets which are being opened for new
                                products abroad are given the right to sell their exchange in the
                                open market. For instance, Argentine grapes which are sold in the
                                United States are allowed to sell the dollars received from those
                                sales in the open market.</p>
                            <p>The second category of exchange is this “open” market and means that
                                all exchange which does not come from the sale of Argentine exports
                                or which comes from exports which are exempted, as indicated above,
                                is sold in the open market; that is, subject to free
                                competition.</p>
                            <p>There is a third category for which exchange is granted for amounts
                                under 1,000 pesos but this may be left out of consideration as it
                                does not affect the larger transactions.</p>
                            <p>The difference between the two rates is usually between 20 and 25 per
                                cent. On January 31, 1933, in the first category 100 U. S. dollars
                                were worth 323.57 Argentine paper pesos and in the second category,
                                388 pesos, a difference of about 20 per cent.</p>
                            <p>The advice given by the Exchange Control Commission to Mr. Buxton was
                                that if he did not like their restrictions, that he could buy the
                                exchange for his steel rope in the “open” market but his reply was
                                that in that case he would have to pay 20 per cent more than his
                                competitors. <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0585"/>I find, in
                                questioning the trade, that many importers of American products are
                                simply basing their imports on the open market rate. This can be
                                done where imports are not so strongly competitive but what they can
                                add this 20 per cent extra to the cost of the goods and pass it on
                                to the consumers.</p>
                            <p>There is felt through all of this a definite tendency on the part of
                                the Argentine Government to bring pressure on the United States to
                                conclude a reciprocal treaty, and on that account of [<hi
                                    rend="italic">sic</hi>] this matter should be called to the
                                attention of the Department of State as it has a direct bearing on
                                that question.</p>
                            <p>Unless a commercial treaty is concluded, which may modify the above
                                position, two conclusions seem evident: <list>
                                    <item>First, that our exports to Argentine will be restricted to
                                        the amount of our imports from Argentina;</item>
                                    <item>Second, that pressure will be exerted to substitute
                                        European goods for American goods wherever possible by
                                        giving exchange for the purchase of such goods if ordered
                                        from Europe but refusing it if ordered from the United
                                        States.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>We, therefore, must firmly and frankly oppose the position of the
                                Argentine Government that trade must be strictly bilateral. Since we
                                have kept records in good years and bad, U. S. exports to Argentina
                                have practically doubled Argentine exports to the United States. In
                                normal times such excess of imports is provided for by an excess of
                                Argentine exports to Northern Europe, principally Scandinavia,
                                Holland, Belgium and in some years Germany and Italy. Considering
                                the large investments in Argentina of the United Kingdom and the
                                invisible balances, the large excess of exchange which comes from
                                the sale of Argentine products to Great Britain, which purchases
                                roughly 35 per cent of Argentina’s exports, has been used to
                                purchase British exchange to be used for the remittance of invisible
                                balances coming from purchases of the British-owned Argentine
                                railways and other public utility companies, dividends on British
                                investments, interest on foreign loans held in England, etc. It is
                                not, therefore, so much the triangular theory of trade between
                                England, Argentina and the United States, which we must sustain as
                                it is the multiangular theory of all world trade which must be kept
                                in mind.</p>
                            <p>A copy of this report is given to the Ambassador for such comment as
                                he feels should be made.</p>

                            not yet received any exchange for any of its pending drafts, discussed
                            the matter with the head of the Exchange Control Commission who advised
                            him that the Commission held that the exportation of grapes to the

                            derived from the sale thereof could be sold in the “free market”. The
                            head of the Commission promised Dr. Dye to review the correspondence
                            with Messrs. E. Waterman &amp; Company, but stated that he could not say
                            whether any further decision would be given, or if so, when it would be
                            rendered. He added that the application of this firm would have to await
                            its turn.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Dye has informed the representative of Messrs. E. Waterman &amp;

                            that the attitude of the Exchange authorities has not changed and that
                            they are as non-committal as ever with regard to the exchange

                            <p>The correspondence of Messrs. Holtorf &amp; Lindner, Inc., taken as a
                                whole assumes the position that the United States Government should
                                insist that the exchange derived from the sale of Argentine fruit to
                                the United States should be set aside for the payment of American
                                fruit shipments to Argentina and more specifically, that the
                                exchange derived from the shipment of grapes to the United States
                                should be set aside to pay for the shipment of American apples to
                                Argentina, and that the United States Government should insist
                                strongly upon this being done.</p>
                            <p>It also suggests that in order to enforce this position, an embargo
                                should be placed on shipments of Argentine grapes to the United
                                States’ until such time as the Argentine Government agrees to
                                compensate fruit shipments in one direction with fruit shipments in
                                the other.</p>
                            <p>In my opinion, while this might be satisfactory to the exporters and
                                importers of fruit, particularly grapes and apples, it would damage
                                our export trade to Argentina as a whole. The Argentine Government
                                has definitely assumed the position that the exchange which derives
                                from the sale of Argentine products to any country will be devoted
                                to the imports from that country but that no more exchange will be
                                given than derives from such sales. It is a position into which the
                                Argentine Government was practically forced when it concluded the
                                Roca Agreement with the United Kingdom, whereby they agree to give
                                Great Britain all the exchange which derived from the sale of
                                Argentine products to Great Britain except a certain sum which was
                                to be set aside for service on their public debt. Other nations
                                having “most favored nation” clauses in their treaties with
                                Argentina, thereupon demanded the same treatment and agreements have
                                successfully been made with the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland
                                and other countries on the same basis. Therefore, by the process of
                                elimination the exchange position has reached the point where only
                                the exchange is left which derives from the sale of Argentine
                                products to the United States’ to be utilized for imports from the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>For the past twenty-five years, as a general average, our exports to
                                Argentina have been almost double our imports from Argentina. If we,
                                as a government, assume the position that we will be willing to
                                accept the arrangement that the exchange derived from the sale of
                                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0588"/>Argentine products in
                                the United States will be devoted to the purchase of American
                                products and no more than that, we must immediately resign
                                ourselves’ to a considerable decrease in our export trade to
                                Argentina. Consequently, I do not believe that the United States
                                Government should agree in principle to the balancing of our trade
                                with Argentina.</p>
                            <p>The position evidently assumed by Holtorf &amp; Lindner, however, is
                                that the trade as a whole should not be taken into consideration but
                                that only the exports of fruit and that we should insist on fruit
                                shipments to the two countries’ balancing. However, if we were to
                                take that position and take up commodity by commodity, there would
                                be a large number of commodities for which no protection would be
                                available.</p>
                            <p>They also suggest that an embargo should be placed on Argentine
                                grapes in case the Argentine Government does not agree to this
                                arrangement. However, at the present time, the State Department has
                                no power to place such an embargo and only Congress has the
                                power.</p>
                            <p>All of the above merely presents well-founded objections to the
                                procedure suggested by Messrs. Holtorf &amp; Lindner but they have a
                                right to ask what specifically we propose to do about it as to
                                present merely negative arguments is not sufficient. The immediate
                                reply is that there is only one thing under the present
                                circumstances which can be done, and that is for Congress to give
                                the President of the United States the power to adjust international
                                trade by means of treaties and leave in his hands the power to put
                                an embargo if such should be necessary, or to raise or lower tariffs
                                in an endeavor to secure a world-wide adjustment of our
                                international trade.</p>
                            <p>As I see it, that is the only specific remedy which can be applied at
                                the present moment. Whether such a remedy is to the interest of the
                                United States as a whole is for the Congress of the United States to
                                decide and it is quite possible that before a reply could be
                                received by Messrs. Holtorf &amp; Lindner in the United States, the
                                Congress will already have decided the matter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Wilson</hi>: Yesterday we received five reports
                            from the Commercial Attaché in Buenos Aires, all chiefly concerned with
                            the exchange problem.</p>
                        <p>Summarized, they indicate:</p>
                        <p>1. That the serious situation of American interests, as regards the
                            allotment of official exchange, has become worse: That, contrary to its
                            announcement that exchange necessary for debt service would be <pb
                                n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0589"/>deducted from all sources, the
                            Argentine Government is apparently taking the exchange to service its
                            American borrowings chiefly from Argentine exports to the United States,
                            thereby reducing the amount of official exchange available for American
                            exporters to Argentina. Practically all official exchange is understood
                            to have gone to British, Belgian and Dutch exporters.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Commercial Attaché reports that the amount of free
                            exchange is apparently increasing and that American exporters are
                            becoming reconciled to using the more expensive free market.</p>
                        <p>2. A possibly encouraging sign is that the Argentine Government is
                            apparently giving consideration to the question of American blocked
                            balances. The Minister of Finance is said to have offered 5 year 2%
                            bonds at rates of 10% below official rates to certain American holders
                            of peso balances but this offer was refused. The Ministry of Finance has
                            sent a questionnaire to the banks to ascertain the total amounts of
                            blocked accounts. Also the question is rumored to be about to have an
                            airing in the Argentine parliament and Dye hopefully reports that there
                            is considerable agitation amongst Argentine importers against
                            restrictions on sale of dollar exchange.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Veatch<note n="11" xml:id="d603fn11">Roy Veatch, an assistant in the
                                Office of the Economic Adviser.</note> is finishing his study of the
                            Argentine exchange situation. I understand that his conclusion—in which
                            I concur—is that to get concessions from Argentina in exchange matters
                            we must be prepared to offer something in return. Possibly a reciprocal
                            tariff agreement. The Commercial Attaché reports that Argentine pressure
                            for a reciprocal tariff agreement is continuing.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit for the
                            Department’s information the substance of reports given me
                            confidentially this week by the management of American banks in
                            Argentina.</p>
                        <p>Unblocking arrangements to free foreign exchange that began with the Roca
                            Agreement in October and afterwards with importers of British, American,
                            Spanish, Italian, German, and Dutch nationalities, released
                            approximately four hundred million paper pesos in bonds, ranging from
                            fifteen to twenty years maturity and at conversion rates much more
                            favorable than current official exchange.</p>
                        <p>There is a strong and increasing demand in Argentina for imported goods.
                            Importers of all nationalities still have frozen something more than one
                            hundred million paper pesos, partly representing peso credits frozen
                            before agreements were made and partly accumulated in the <pb n="520"
                                xml:id="pg_520" facs="0590"/>last three months. There is not
                            sufficient exchange available, either at the official rate permitted by
                            the Finance Ministry, or at the free bank rate under import license, to
                            relieve the accumulated pressure.</p>
                        <p>Under the auspices of the Buenos Aires Exchange (<hi rend="italic">Bolsa
                                de Comercio</hi>), importers of all nationalities have made
                            representations to Dr. Pinedo, the Minister of Finance, that they plan,
                            within the next ten days, to stage a demonstration of protest against
                            exchange restriction unless the Government suggests remedial action
                            immediately available.</p>
                        <p>It is reported to me confidentially that the Minister has under
                            consideration and is prepared shortly to announce, a plan that will be
                            available to all importers without respect to nationality. It consists
                            in a scheme to unblock all remaining frozen exchange, attributable to
                            imports, in five year Argentine Government notes, guaranteed as to
                            interest, amortization, and maturity by this Government. The notes are
                            to be offered in all denominations over one thousand pesos and are to be
                            amortized ten per cent each six months until maturity, with interest at
                            two per cent. The exchange conversion is proposed at the current
                            official rate, which is now fluctuating widely with the growing weakness
                            of the peso and the prospect of further official inflation.</p>
                        <p>It is not possible to report at this time the probable date the Minister
                            will make public his proposal, nor the probabilities of its acceptance
                            by the importing interests, in view of the fact that the arrangement is
                            not yet generally known in the market.</p>

                            amount of American blocked funds which would be affected by the
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Is reported opposition of American and other Chambers of Commerce in
                            Buenos Aires a result of belief that they can eventually obtain a more
                            favorable arrangement? If so, how soon and on what basis?</p>

                        <p>76. Your telegram No. 48, May 11, noon. No further details available
                            until return of Minister of Finance about May 21st, see report 3 of
                            Commercial Attaché air mail May 8th. No action by Government appears
                            desirable now. If intimation or declaration made that no official
                            exchange will be available to those who do not accept Government’s
                            proposal then question of Government action would arise. Amount of
                            American blocked funds affected would probably not exceed 35 million
                            paper. Rates will depend on form of definite announcement by the
                            Minister of Finance. No opposition of American or other Chambers of
                            Commerce has been offered because no official decree has been issued and
                            they await developments.</p>

                            instruction No. 49 of May 16, 2 p.m. concerning blocked peso balances, I
                            hereby submit the following report on each of the five points raised in
                            the Department’s telegram. This report has been prepared in
                            collaboration with Consul General A. M. Warren, as well as with the
                            Commercial Attaché, Dr. Dye, and has the approval of both of them. An
                            additional report will be submitted shortly.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>1:</label>
                            <item>The best estimates of the total sums blocked are from 150,000,000
                                to 200,000,000 paper pesos. Any estimate as to the total held by
                                principal nationalities is very difficult. Estimates of the balance
                                held by Americans range from 35,000,000 to 60,000,000 pesos. It is
                                probable that 40,000,000 is a fair figure. It is not believed that
                                the British hold very large balances, although they do hold some
                                blocked pesos. The estimate of the Italian blocked pesos is from
                                15,000,000 to 18,000,000 pesos.</item>
                            <label>2:</label>
                            <item>The percentage of the American total represented by accumulated
                                earnings on investments in Argentina and the principal holders of
                                blocked accounts in this category, together with the approximate
                                amounts held by them, can be determined only after patient and long
                                continued personal investigation. The principal holders are the West
                                India Oil Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph
                                Company, the Westinghouse Electric Company, and possibly the
                                International Harvester Company, the Ford Company and General
                                Motors, although it is believed that recently the latter Companies
                                have been clearing out their frozen accounts by buying in the open
                                market. However, the Managers of these Companies in Argentina object
                                to making known, even in a confidential way, the exact amounts of
                                their holdings. A quicker and more definite way of ascertaining this
                                total would be to consult the head offices of the larger Companies
                                operating in Argentina, and a practical method of beginning would be
                                to take the list of those who subscribed to the last issue of frozen
                                pesos, which can be secured from the Foreign Trade Council in New
                                York.</item>

                                committee was a fact-finding committee which has investigated the
                                subject and made its report and is taking no further action. No
                                action has been taken by groups representing other nationalities
                                except the Association of Importers, which comprises many
                                nationalities. Their action was primarily directed to secure relief
                                from the Government’s decree of November 28, 1933, depreciating the
                                peso and causing <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0593"/>tosses to
                                importers who had already sold goods imported on the basis of
                                contracts made at the rate of exchange in force prior to November
                                28, 1933. That committee was not primarily a committee for the
                                unfreezing of peso balances. As a matter of fact, the members of
                                this committee do not, except in part, represent the holders of
                                frozen balances.</item>

                                the Argentine Government’s latest proposal are held in suspense

                                what is proposed to other nationalities, as there is no basis for
                                action at present except an official statement issued to the press
                                by the Ministry of Finance, a copy of which was sent in the
                                Commercial Attaché’s report of May 8. In this statement outlining
                                the operation proposed to the Italian Government by the Ministry of
                                Finance, it will be noted that the Ministry states its intention to
                                grant similar offers to other importers. The Embassy is endeavoring
                                to secure a copy of the actual agreement signed between the Italian
                                Embassy and the Ministry of Finance.</item>
                            <label>5:</label>
                            <item>In my opinion, no action can be taken at present and this is the
                                consensus of opinion of all bankers and business men who have been
                                consulted. While this is a personal opinion, I do not believe that
                                our own Government should take any position at all until it is
                                determined in Congress whether the President shall be given powers
                                to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements. Certainly no position
                                should be taken until we have more definite information from the
                                Argentine Ministry of Finance, which will probably be forthcoming
                                within a few days.</item>

                            May 18, 1934, concerning blocked peso balances, I have to report that no
                            further developments have occurred. The Commercial Attaché, Dr. Dye, is
                            awaiting further information from the Minister of Finance concerning the
                            Government’s recent declaration of intention to offer to convert the
                            frozen balances of other nationalities, besides the Italian, into a five

                                    the exchange control situation, and to put you in touch with the

                                    You in turn are instructed upon your arrival in each of these

                                    find that these missions have given very considerable thought to
                                    the subject and have kept themselves closely advised.”</p>

                            by Mr. Donald R. Heath of the Division of Latin American Affairs of the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The mission will remain in Rio de Janeiro for a week or longer and then
                            will sail for Buenos Aires. It is requested that you transmit to the
                            American Embassy in Rio de Janeiro copies of all despatches and
                            telegrams regarding exchange sent to the Department after June 15 so
                            that the members of the mission may be informed of the latest
                            developments before their arrival in Buenos Aires.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Williams and Mr. Heath are fully informed of the course of
                            developments in Argentina on the basis of the excellent despatches with
                            relation to exchange matters which have been prepared by you, by the
                            Commercial Attaché and by the Consul General. There are a number of
                            questions of fact, however, which they will wish to be advised upon when
                            they arrive in Buenos Aires. It is requested, therefore, that you have
                            prepared a report, to the extent that material may be available, with
                            regard to the following points: <list>

                        <p>You may find it desirable to enlist the cooperation of the banking and
                            business community in securing information on at least some of these
                            points. The Department is informed that useful information with respect
                            to certain exchange matters was collected by the American Chamber of
                            Commerce in Brazil through the use of a questionnaire to the members of
                            the American business community.</p>
                        <p>The Department trusts that the dispatch of this mission will indicate to
                            the Argentine governmental authorities the importance attached to it
                            here. Please plan to take full advantage of the visit of the mission to
                            try to work out a suggested satisfactory understanding with the
                            Argentine Government for submission to the Department, or
                            recommendations to the Department as to the line of policy this
                            Government should pursue.</p>

                            Americans. These inquiries seek some intimation from the Department as
                            to the probable future policy of this Government with respect to these
                            accounts. Specifically, two questions have been asked repeatedly: <list>

                                    or an improvement of the situation, in connection with the
                                    negotiation of a reciprocal trade agreement with the Argentine
                                    Government?</item>

                                <item>Is this Government considering or will it consider extending
                                    assistance to Americans holding these accounts through the
                                    Reconstruction Finance Corporation or an Export-Import

                            </list></p>
                        <p>The desire of holders of blocked accounts to learn something of the
                            proposed future policy of this Government with respect to this matter is
                            quite understandable. These people must determine whether to hold their
                            peso accounts in the hope that this Government <pb n="526"
                                xml:id="pg_526" facs="0596"/>will come to their assistance, directly
                            or indirectly, or whether it is wise for them to clear their accounts,
                            either through taking their losses by purchase of exchange on the open
                            market, or through acceptance of bonds which may be offered by the
                            Argentine Government.</p>
                        <p>Up to the present time the Department has taken no position regarding
                            blocked accounts in the Argentine and it has, of course, carefully
                            refrained from offering advice as to the disposal of blocked balances by
                            the American holders. The Department desires, however, to give further
                            careful consideration to this problem in the light of recent
                            developments, and for this purpose it has formulated the following
                            questions for its own consideration. It will be appreciated if you and
                            Mr. John H. Williams will bear these questions in mind during the
                            latter’s visit in Argentina, and give the Department the benefit of your
                            advice with respect to them: <list>

                                    desirable to clear the blocked accounts by some other means than
                                    the use of dollar exchange currently available?</item>

                            No. 107 of June 30, 1934, Mr. John H. Williams, Mr. Donald R. Heath and
                            Mr. Eric Lamb arrived in Buenos Aires from Montevideo on Sunday, July
                            29. As the Embassy has already reported, a fact-finding Committee was
                            formed some time ago of Americans in business here, who are in close
                            touch with the present exchange situation, to assist Mr. Williams during
                            his stay in Buenos Aires. This Committee, headed by Mr. C. C. Batchelder
                            of the General Electric Company, is composed of the American Consul
                            General and representatives of the two American banks and other business
                            concerns.</p>
                        <p>On July 30 there was a conference at the Embassy between Mr. Williams and

                            situation were explored. Following this meeting I presented Mr. Williams
                            to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to Dr. Manuel R. Alvarado, the
                            Minister of Public Works, who is Acting Minister of Finance in the
                            absence of Dr. Federico Pinedo. The Ministry of Finance is endeavoring
                            to arrange a private meeting between Mr. Williams and Dr. Pinedo as well
                            as put him in touch with Government officials in charge of exchange
                            matters.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Ambassador</hi>: During our stay in
                                Buenos Aires we have interviewed various Argentine officials,
                                including especially Dr. Pinedo, Finance Minister, Dr. Duhau,
                                Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Prebisch, the economic and financial
                                advisor of the government, and Dr. Gagneux, the Exchange Controller.
                                We have had two meetings with the American Chamber of Commerce and
                                individual meetings <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0599"/>with
                                American importers and bankers; and have discussed our problem with
                                the American Government representatives.</p>
                            <p>Under the Exchange Control system now in force, Argentina allocates
                                to us more than twice as much exchange as is created by our imports.
                                But since the greater part is required for debt service, we receive
                                only about half enough official exchange to cover our exports to
                                Argentina. To put it another way, Argentina allocates to us as cover
                                for our exports about as much official exchange as is created by her
                                exports to us, and in addition supplies official exchange for dollar
                                debt service; but this means that for about half of our exports to
                                Argentina we must have recourse to the “free market” at a premium
                                over the official rate, which has recently been around 15 per cent.
                                In allocating the exchange Argentina discriminates as between
                                imports from us which she regards as more essential and imports
                                which she regards as less essential. It seems clear also, though on
                                this we have had no definite admission, that as between similar
                                imports from different countries, she discriminates in favor of
                                countries, notably England, with which she has concluded special
                                exchange agreements. But it was stated at the meeting with the
                                Exchange Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce that the
                                range of such products is not great. The method of discrimination as
                                between different imports from us is the requirement of a prior
                                exchange permit, imports receiving such a permit being entitled to
                                official exchange and those not receiving such a permit being forced
                                for cover into the free market. Action on the application for permit
                                can and should be had before the import leaves the country of
                                origin, unless the importer is prepared to provide the exchange
                                cover through the free market.</p>
                            <p>Our current exchange position could be improved by inducing Argentina
                                to provide more official exchange or by the removal, or narrowing,
                                of the spread between the official and the free market rates. We
                                have, in addition, the problem of how to release unpaid
                                balances.</p>
                            <p>Means of inducing Argentina to allocate to us more official exchange
                                seem unpromising. We have not the trade position to press for, or to
                                benefit by, a compensation arrangement, like the Roca Agreement, and
                                have not favored such a policy even in countries in which our trade
                                position is strong. We could create more dollar exchange by a
                                bilateral trade agreement, but will probably not wish to do so in
                                the near future. An advance of capital or credit would create more
                                dollar exchange, but we have seen no evidence that Argentina wishes
                                to borrow or the United States to lend; and except possibly in
                                connection with freeing blocked funds (discussed below), which would
                                provide no additional current exchange, there does not appear to be
                                any sound reason, on either side, for recommending this type of
                                solution at present.</p>
                            <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0600"/>
                            <p>Termination of the special exchange agreements with other countries
                                would also help our position, though the Roca Agreement probably
                                impairs our position less than one might in principle assume; but
                                the Argentine officials state frankly that they have responded
                                unavoidably to pressure in making these agreements, and emphasize
                                the fact that the agreements are terminable upon the termination of
                                exchange control. We have received the impression that they have
                                little enthusiasm for the Roca Agreement but see no way out of it at
                                present. They also appear to feel, somewhat resentfully, that these
                                agreements have not given them the assurance of their foreign market
                                for beef which they expected. It would appear, however, to be both
                                impolitic and futile to raise any questions respecting these
                                agreements with Argentina, though it does appear that the United
                                States has good ground, in logic at least, for pointing out to Great
                                Britain the inconsistencies of her policy as between countries like
                                Chile and Brazil in which her trade position is weak and countries
                                like Argentina and Uruguay in which her trade position is strong,
                                the policy being, as it now seems to us, to plead in the former
                                countries for avoidance of compensation agreements, on broad
                                economic grounds, and to press for such agreements in the latter, on
                                narrower grounds of special advantage.</p>
                            <p>The remaining method of solution of our exchange problem lies in the
                                achievement of equilibrium in the Argentine balance of payments,
                                such as would permit the removal of exchange control and the
                                emergence of a single exchange rate, equally applicable to all
                                exporting countries, in a free market. The members of the Exchange
                                Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce expressed themselves
                                in favor of this solution, as both the most feasible and the most
                                desirable. Whether, and when, this solution can be achieved depends
                                upon a number of factors. The chief is world prices of Argentine
                                exports, which have in recent months advanced substantially,
                                materially improving the trade balance and giving rise to a
                                distinctly optimistic atmosphere. This improvement has been
                                accompanied by a narrowing of the spread in the exchange rates in
                                the past two months, which appears to mean that more exchange is
                                becoming available in the free market. By reason of her internal
                                policy, which has resulted in a substantial fall in farm costs,
                                Argentina is in a very strong position to take advantage of any
                                improvement in world prices for her products, and does not require a
                                return of prices to the pre-depression level. This matter of
                                internal prices and costs in relation to external we have
                                investigated in some detail, and have discussed with the Minister of
                                Agriculture and with Dr. Prebisch.</p>
                            <p>The Argentine Government is also endeavoring to improve its balance
                                of payments position by applying a priority list on imports and by
                                effecting conversions of its foreign debt at a lower rate of
                                interest. <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0601"/>It is in a strong
                                position to achieve the latter, as security markets strengthen,
                                owing to its record of maintaining the full debt service during the
                                depression. Two British loans have already been converted, and
                                discussions are now proceeding with respect to others. The Argentine
                                officials have not omitted pointing out to us that a conversion of
                                their six per cent dollar bonds into five per cents would help their
                                position considerably, but it will probably be some time before such
                                an operation in our market could be successful.</p>
                            <p>The Argentines have also stated that under a system of free exchange
                                they might not think it prudent to relax at once their system of
                                import permits since there appears to be a strong tendency for
                                imports to increase when control is relaxed or exchange conditions
                                improve; they would have to be guided by actual experience.</p>
                            <p>One possible obstacle to a nearby removal of exchange control may be
                                the fact that at present the Government makes a substantial profit
                                in the official market by buying the exchange created by the
                                exporters at a considerably lower rate than that at which it is
                                auctioned off to importers having prior exchange permits. This
                                profit has been used in part to buy grains from the farmers at an
                                official minimum price. The Minister of Agriculture has informed me
                                that the Government has now sold all its grain holdings and realized
                                a substantial profit, but he took obvious pride in explaining how
                                the spread in the exchange rates provided funds to finance such
                                operations, and outlined a policy of building up reserves of this
                                character to aid in supporting any agricultural production which
                                might experience temporary market weakness. So long as these
                                operations persist, they may provide a strong motive for retaining
                                the present system of exchange control; but this possibility must be
                                weighed against the counter-possibility that the producers, once
                                they feel their foreign market is assured, may demand that the full
                                price of the exchange, as in a free market, should come to them.
                                This is the development which in Uruguay has resulted (last week) in
                                a new exchange policy substantially enlarging the free market.</p>
                            <p>On the whole, I have received the impression that the Argentine
                                situation is substantially improving, and that if the improvement
                                continues it will result in a narrowing of the spread of exchange
                                rates, the expansion of the free market, and eventually the removal
                                of exchange control. How quickly this will occur cannot be
                                estimated. One recent piece of evidence was the removal (August 1)
                                of exchange control on small private (mainly immigrant) remittances,
                                estimated at about 40,000,000 pesos a year, and the transfer of
                                these operations to the free market. Another may be Dr. Gagneux’s
                                statement to us that the present exchange control mechanism,
                                established last November, was designed to permit an easy and rapid
                                transition to a free <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0602"/>market
                                when and as conditions permit. Apart from such straws as these, the
                                Argentine officials have carefully avoided making any definite
                                statements or commitments respecting their future policy.</p>
                            <p>Two remaining questions are the attitude of the American business
                                community in Buenos Aires, and the problem of blocked funds. We have
                                the impression that American export interests and bankers in this
                                market feel that the treatment being accorded them is as
                                satisfactory under the circumstances as can reasonably be expected.
                                In their view the system of prior exchange permits combined with
                                freedom of access to the free market after notice is served that
                                permits will not be granted is acceptable until such time as
                                conditions permit the removal of exchange control. Thus far, the
                                Chamber of Commerce Exchange Committee has supplied us with no
                                complaints of discrimination or citations of cases of unfair
                                treatment, and on the other hand several of its members have stated
                                expressly that we were being accorded fair and reasonable treatment,
                                all things considered. On the other hand, they point out that the
                                exchange control has undoubtedly been injurious to many of our small
                                exporters, and that the present comparative absence of complaint is
                                in part due to the fact that only the fittest now survive.</p>
                            <p>In the Chamber’s view, the most serious problem at present is that of
                                liquidating the unpaid balances. We understand that the Chamber
                                intends to supply us with an estimate of the amount of these funds.
                                Dr. Gagneux, the Exchange Controller, gave us an estimate of
                                25,000,000 pesos (the American part only), and points out that
                                creditors have now the option of liquidating through the free
                                market. The Chamber of Commerce Exchange Committee stated that to
                                some extent liquidation was occurring in this way, though this
                                method involves a substantial loss in the exchange difference. The
                                Government has offered to pay off blocked funds with five-year notes
                                (similar to the arrangement offered Italy) but these are not
                                acceptable, according to the Chamber, unless they can be discounted
                                for cash (dollars) in the United States. The Exchange Controller is
                                anxious to clear up the unpaid balances, and points out that the
                                removal from the market of this potential pressure would be of great
                                assistance. Both he and the Chamber’s Exchange Committee have raised
                                the question whether the Export-Import Bank could be interested in a
                                transaction of this character.</p>
                            <p>Our two main conclusions are: <list>

                                        balances. This may now be done through the free market and
                                        to some <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0603"/>extent is
                                        being done, but this method involves an exchange loss. The
                                        alternative method of payment in five year notes depends
                                        upon the discounting of such notes by the Export-Import Bank
                                        or some other American institution. Anything we can do to
                                        facilitate the liquidation of these balances will
                                        undoubtedly assist Argentina in her general solution of the
                                        exchange problem, and will thereby improve our own treatment
                                        on current trade account.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s confidential instruction No. 117 of July 28,
                            1934, containing a series of questions with respect to Argentine blocked
                            peso accounts held by Americans, regarding which the Department wished
                            the Embassy to consult with Dr. John H. Williams during his visit to
                            Buenos Aires. As this instruction reached here on August 5, the day
                            after Dr. Williams’ departure for Santiago, the Embassy communicated the
                            questions raised therein to him through the American Embassy in
                            Santiago, and now encloses a copy of Dr. Williams’ report dated August
                            10, 1934, in reply.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that in his covering letter to the Embassy<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d614fn13">Not printed.</note> Dr. Williams states that he
                            expects to be in Washington on or about August 30 at which time he will
                            discuss the question of blocked peso accounts in Argentina with the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>As the Department has already been informed through confidential report
                            dated August 10, 1934, entitled “Argentine Foreign Exchange Situation”,
                            of the American Consulate General, as well as through confidential
                            report No. 311–C, dated August 10, 1934, from the Assistant Trade
                            Commissioner in Buenos Aires,<note n="14" xml:id="d614fn14">Neither
                                found in Department files.</note> the question of blocked peso
                            accounts has been radically affected by the marked appreciation of the
                            peso during the past few weeks. On Friday, August 10, the exchange rate
                            in the free market was quoted as low as 3.50 Argentine pesos to the
                            dollar, with a spread only of roughly ten centavos between the free rate
                            and the official rate. As pointed out in the report from the Consulate
                            General under reference, this difference is so small that no great loss
                            is suffered by the holder of blocked funds awaiting official permits if
                            he should purchase in the free market at recent prevailing rates.</p>
                        <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0604"/>
                        <p>While it seems highly desirable that the American Government should
                            extend all reasonable assistance and cooperation to American holders of
                            blocked funds in foreign countries, it is felt that the change in the
                            exchange situation in this country described above may relieve the
                            Government from taking action with regard to peso balances now | blocked
                            in Argentina. In this connection it is known that numerous holders of
                            blocked balances have during the past two weeks liquidated their
                            accounts and with the continuation of the prevailing rates in the free
                            market it is a fair assumption that the bulk of the holders of blocked
                            accounts will take advantage of the situation and clear up their
                            outstanding deposits awaiting transfer. American banks informed the
                            Embassy this morning that according to rough estimates thirty per cent,
                            of their blocked balances have been liquidated in the last two weeks,
                            and that liquidation shows a progressive volume. It would appear
                            accordingly that the question of a bond issue for balances now blocked
                            has diminished in importance, since it is apparent that conversion at
                            the free market rates prevailing at this time is more favorable than the
                            terms of the proposed bond issue.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the United States Government in Argentina are
                            endeavoring wherever possible to assist individuals or private
                            organizations in this matter. As already reported, the American Chamber
                            of Commerce formed an Exchange Committee to collaborate with Dr.
                            Williams during his visit here; this Committee gave Dr. Williams
                            valuable assistance on the subject of blocked funds, and I have
                            expressed the hope that I may be able to call upon its members for
                            further assistance should the occasion arise.</p>
                        <p>If the situation should change, and it is found that United States
                            Government agencies should be able to assist in financial operations of
                            this type, it is suggested that they might explore the position of the
                            holders of the fifteen-year Treasury bonds issued in 1933 which have no
                            ready market. However, I believe the opinion must be advanced that the
                            holders of these bonds accepted the Argentine obligation voluntarily,
                            and, in effect, were utilized by the Argentine Ministry of Finance to
                            carry out a program of primary interest to this country rather than to
                            the United States. Any action taken by the American governmental
                            agencies or semi-official banks to grant relief to these bondholders, it
                            is suggested, might establish a basis of encouragement to the Argentine
                            Ministry of Finance to repeat this operation if at some future time the
                            exchange problem of this country is again under pressure.</p>
                        <p>It is believed the best interest of the United States will be served by a
                            constructive, general policy to be applied to all Latin America for the
                            encouragement of the ultimate release of exchange quotas on any
                            bi-lateral basis. A policy of encouragement based on the general <pb
                                n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0605"/>situation in Latin America with
                            appropriate evaluation of the efforts made in separate countries to
                            fight the depression and strengthen their financial position will give
                            the soundest advantage to American trade in this continent.</p>
                        <p>The alternative to a general American policy of constructive assistance
                            is a strict bargaining that cannot help arousing resentment where the
                            United States holds a favorable balance of exchange and will undoubtedly
                            restrict further such consideration as is now given to American
                            importers where our exchange position is unfavorable, as in Argentina
                            and Uruguay, on the basis of a possible future treatment measured by
                            American imports of Argentine agriculture and meat products.</p>
                        <p>The Consul General has collaborated in the preparation of this despatch,
                            and the foregoing represent our joint conclusions.</p>

                            <p>In reply to the Ambassador’s inquiry, based on an instruction from
                                the State Department and transmitted by telephone this morning, my
                                report of August 3 handed to the Ambassador contains our views in
                                general on the blocked pesos question. Our investigation in Buenos
                                Aires brought out that the blocked funds situation does not now
                                constitute a pressing problem. The amount pertaining to American
                                interests, placed by Gagneux at 25 million pesos, has been
                                diminishing as exchange has become available in the free market. The
                                latter has been greatly expanded in recent months. The results of an
                                inquiry recently conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in
                                Buenos Aires and received just prior to our departure, indicates
                                that American firms in Argentina, omitting public utilities, are
                                obtaining approximately 75 per cent, of their dollar exchange in the
                                free market. New accumulations would not seem to be a factor since
                                under the prior import system effective at the beginning of the
                                year, importers are advised in advance whether official exchange
                                will be available to them. In other words, American business
                                interests in Argentina for the most part appear to have adjusted
                                their current operations to meet the existing exchange
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>The substantial improvement in the external position of Argentina
                                during the past few months has an important bearing on the question
                                of blocked pesos. The probabilities are that if the recovery
                                continues, the spread in rates will narrow as it has already begun
                                to do, the free <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0606"/>market will
                                be further expanded and the amount of blocked pesos will
                                dwindle.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the specific questions brought forward, <hi
                                    rend="italic">Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4</hi> it is felt that the
                                Department and its representatives in Argentina should, of course,
                                assist and cooperate with individuals or private concerns but since
                                the Argentine Government has established as definite policies both
                                the maximum amount of current exchange which it will furnish to
                                American commercial interests and the terms upon which it will fund
                                blocked pesos, I should not expect that treatment accorded us on
                                either current or past due trade account could be bettered by
                                negotiation whether conducted by State Department representatives or
                                by American concerns acting alone.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Numbers 5, 6</hi>. Both the American interests and
                                the Argentine Government recognize the desirability of clearing up
                                the blocked accounts by a funding operation rather than by waiting
                                for them to be liquidated gradually through current availabilities.
                                The Argentine Government has made a definite offer, similar in all
                                important respects to that made to the Italians (five year two per
                                cent. Treasury dollar bonds), which it is my impression will not be
                                substantially modified. If accepted, the detailed arrangements could
                                presumably be handled by a representative body such as the Chamber
                                of Commerce.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Number 7</hi>. It is extremely doubtful whether the
                                obligations which would be offered by the Argentine Government in
                                exchange for blocked peso balances could be discounted or otherwise
                                negotiated through the private commercial banks in the United States
                                in such a way as to enable the owners to realize a large percentage
                                in cash, because there is no market in our country for this type of
                                paper. Therefore, acceptance of the offer really hinges on whether
                                our Government, through either the Reconstruction Finance
                                Corporation or the Export Import Bank, decides that it is feasible
                                to make a market for the bonds.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Numbers 8, 9, and 13</hi>, bring in pertinent
                                aspects of the case which the Government banking institution
                                concerned would have to analyze in the light of its own policy. That
                                a blocked funds problem, of course, is found in all the countries
                                which we have visited would be one of the factors for consideration.
                                With respect to the Brazilian desire to secure a dollar loan, the
                                fact of a decision to grant facilities through official channels, to
                                American holders of blocked funds bonds or notes would not establish
                                a precedent or basis for a loan, directly or indirectly, from our
                                Government to the Brazilian Government.</p>
                            <p>With respect to possible concessions to the United States (<hi
                                    rend="italic">Question 12</hi>), in exchange for our
                                Government’s making these bonds acceptable to owners of blocked
                                pesos, the Argentine Government might be likely to take the stand
                                that the problem is purely American and that, therefore, it can
                                discern no particular basis for granting concessions to us.</p>

                            one to be delivered to the Consul General, of the report of Dr. John H.
                            Williams of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of his mission of
                            investigation of American foreign exchange problems in Brazil,
                            Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. These copies should be kept in the
                            confidential files of the Embassy and the Consulate General, and
                            precaution should be taken to prevent any material in the report from
                            reaching unauthorized persons.</p>
                        <p>The Department would appreciate receiving by air mail any comments or
                            expression of views which you may care to make on the matters treated in
                            the report. It would be helpful to the Department in its consideration
                            of the exchange problem if the Embassy, possibly in connection with the
                            Commercial Attache and Consul General in Buenos Aires, were to prepare a
                            study of the balance of payments between Argentina and the United States
                            in 1933 and an advance estimate of the balance for 1934.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have delayed replying to the
                            Department’s Instruction No. 143 of October 5, 1934, in order to forward
                            at the same time a report on the balance of payments between Argentina
                            and the United States, which was being prepared by the Consulate
                            General.</p>
                        <p>Before reporting to the Department on American foreign exchange
                            difficulties in Argentina, Dr. Williams freely discussed the problem
                            with both the Embassy and the Consulate General. In my despatch No. 380
                            of August 13, 1934, on “Argentine Blocked Funds Held by Americans”, I
                            reported that shortly after Dr. Williams’ departure from Buenos Aires,
                            the exchange situation had improved to a considerable extent by the
                            marked appreciation of the peso at that time, permitting many holders of
                            blocked funds to liquidate their accounts with no great loss to
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>I further advanced the view that the best interests of the United States
                            would be served by a constructive general policy to be applied to all
                            Latin America for the encouragement of the ultimate release of exchange
                            quotas. The alternative to such a policy, it was stated, <pb n="538"
                                xml:id="pg_538" facs="0608"/>was a strict bargaining which might
                            arouse resentment where the United States holds a favorable balance of
                            exchange, and which would undoubtedly restrict further such exchange as
                            is now given to American importers where our exchange position is
                            unfavorable, as in this country.</p>
                        <p>The yardstick for future exchange treatment accorded American importers
                            would doubtless be the amount of United States imports of Argentine
                            agricultural and meat products. Argentina has used its exchange
                            restrictions as a means of exacting trade agreements with other
                            countries, and I can see no reason to doubt that it is similarly using
                            them vis-à-vis the United States. In the Embassy’s despatch No. 454 of
                            October 19,<note n="15" xml:id="d616fn15">Not printed.</note> I pointed
                            out that in the opinion of one of the leading American banks here the
                            Argentine authorities are making no effort to facilitate American
                            imports to this country, presumably for the purpose of putting pressure,
                            through American commercial interests, on Washington to conclude a
                            reciprocal trade agreement beneficial to Argentina. This point of view
                            is shared by many Americans in business in this country. And, as
                            reported in the Embassy’s confidential despatch No. 471 of November
                                2,<note n="15" xml:id="d616fn16">Not printed.</note> an official of
                            the Ministry of Finance, recently admitted as much to a member of the
                            Embassy staff.</p>
                        <p>The interest taken by Argentine officials in the forthcoming trade
                            discussions in Washington is self-evident. Both the President and the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, knowing that I shall be leaving shortly
                            for the United States, have within the past few days expressed their
                            lively hope that the coming months may see the conclusion of a mutually
                            satisfactory reciprocal agreement, especially one which would admit to
                            our markets a modicum of Argentine meat.</p>
                        <p>There is enclosed a statistical statement on the balance of payments
                            between the United States and Argentina for the first nine months of
                                1934,<note n="15" xml:id="d616fn17">Not printed.</note> which the
                            Consulate General has obtained from the Argentine Exchange Control
                            Commission. The latter office stated that these figures represented such
                            facts as were now available. The Consul General has informed me that the
                            American banks in Buenos Aires, which were approached for an estimate of
                            the amount of free exchange provided in order to arrive at the real as
                            opposed to the apparent balance of payments, advised that they are
                            unable to make an estimate on the grounds that there has been arbitrage
                            in considerable amounts in dollars and that requests for official
                            exchange in substantial amounts are still pending while the actual
                            exchange has been purchased in the open market so that in effect some
                            amounts of official exchange may be said to represent anticipations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that the Naval Attaché of this Embassy, Commander Strother, today
                            informs me that in a quite recent conversation with a high-ranking
                            Argentine naval officer, he stated that in naval circles was being
                            discussed the possibility of engaging two naval officers of a friendly
                            power to come to Argentina for a period of three years for the purpose
                            of giving instruction in the proposed Naval War College; that sentiment
                            among Argentine naval officers was in favor of securing this technical
                            assistance from the United States, and that in any event, only British
                            or American officers were under consideration. He has authorized
                            Commander Strother to discuss the matter with me.</p>
                        <p>Commander Strother is reporting this matter to the Navy Department,
                            having especially in mind its naval aspects as well as its practical
                            repercussion on American interests.</p>
                        <p>Commander Strother tells me further that his informant went so far as
                            even to intimate to him the advisability of my speaking to the President
                            of the Republic on the subject!</p>
                        <p>I have deemed it appropriate to bring this immediately to the notice of
                            the Department for consideration in its broader international
                            aspects.</p>
                        <p>Commander Strother thinks that it may be some months before the subject
                            takes practical shape, and is meanwhile keeping in close touch with the
                            situation.</p>

                            afternoon, delivered your message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
                            He said that since this was the first offer received he thought its
                            acceptance likely although similar proposition would probably be made by
                            Great Britain. At his request I have handed him a memorandum for

                        <p>98. For Secretary and Under Secretary. Referring to Department’s No. 55,
                            June 21, 7 p.m. Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me last night that
                            offer contained therein was accepted in principle but not as a mission
                            but as a simple contract between the Argentine Government and officers
                            selected and that Argentine Ambassador had been telegraphically advised
                            to this effect. Foregoing has been confirmed at Navy Department today by
                            Commander Strother.<note n="19" xml:id="d621fn19">Commander Edmund W.

                            in the course of instruction at the Argentine Naval War College, for a
                            period ending 1 January, 1936, with the proviso that, by mutual consent,
                            the contract may be extended to 1 January, 1937. Copies of these

                            April 9, 1934,<note n="4" xml:id="d625fn4">Not printed.</note> in which
                            you inquire whether the following provision in the pending tariff bill
                            is to be interpreted as meaning that no duty might be placed on
                            Brazilian coffee: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“No proclamation shall be made increasing or decreasing by more
                                    than 50 per centum any existing rate of duty or transferring any
                                    article between the dutiable and free lists”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Under the above provision the Executive would not be permitted to
                            transfer articles from the free to the dutiable lists, but this does not
                            mean that Congress might not do so. It is recognized, however, that a
                            provision for transferring articles from the free to the dutiable list
                            by Executive action would have a certain persuasive value in negotiating
                            with such countries as Brazil, and careful consideration has been given
                            to recommending the inclusion of such a provision in the bill. Such a
                            recommendation has not been made for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>The policy of the United States is to seek reciprocity by reductions in
                            trade barriers and not by increases in them. One of the principal
                            obstacles to the successful execution of a tariff bargaining program is
                            the tendency on the part of countries with which negotiations may be
                            undertaken to pad their rates for bargaining purposes. Experience has
                            shown that, owing to this tendency, the policy of tariff bargaining has
                            in some cases not only failed to reduce trade barriers but has resulted
                            in an actual increase in them owing to the failure to consummate the
                            expected bargains. In any case if rates are padded for bargaining
                            purposes the result of negotiations tends to be merely the removal of
                            bargaining increments without effecting real reductions in trade
                            barriers. It has therefore seemed inadvisable to frame the pending bill
                            in such a way as to imply an intention to indulge in practices which, if
                            resorted to by other countries, would defeat the object of the proposed
                            legislation.</p>
                        <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0614"/>
                        <p>A further consideration is that if the proposed legislation proves
                            successful in its operation during the three years in which the
                            authority to conclude agreements may be exercised, the authority may
                            conceivably be renewed for an indefinite period. It is not considered
                            desirable to frame the legislation in such a way as to facilitate
                            increases in trade barriers by future administrations.</p>
                        <p>You will doubtless have noted that despite the considerations above set
                            forth the provision in the bill to which you have referred seems to
                            contemplate increases in rates as well as decreases. However, your
                            attention is called to the fact that increases can not be effected
                            except pursuant to agreements with foreign countries and the latter are
                            unlikely to consent to increases which have the effect of decreasing the
                            volume of trade. The provision regarding increases in rates takes
                            account of the possibility that in certain circumstances increases in
                            rates might be agreed upon as a part of an arrangement having in view
                            the expansion of trade, as for example when a reduction in the present
                            rate is offered on a specified quantity of imports annually and an
                            increased rate is made applicable to importations in excess of this
                            amount. Such an arrangement would be designed to permit an expansion of
                            trade but to confine such expansion within certain limits.</p>

                        <p>The current trends in commercial policy throughout the world present
                            peculiar difficulties for countries such as the United States and Brazil
                            which customarily have large favorable merchandise balances <pb n="550"

                            large section of the world is moving more and more toward a close
                            regulation and control of foreign trade. Under these tendencies, the
                            principle of equality is rapidly being superseded by preferential
                            treatment and special advantages.</p>
                        <p>In particular, clearing and compensation agreements tend toward the
                            bilateral balancing of trade and the destruction of the surplus exports
                            of countries normally having favorable balances. They tend to reduce the
                            volume of triangular trade, and have thus contributed to the disastrous
                            decline in total world trade. Moreover, they tend to divert purchases
                            from the best markets and to force the import of goods which are less
                            urgently required, or altogether unnecessary. Such a diversion of trade
                            tends to engender international ill-will, and has profoundly disturbed
                            international economic relations.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances the Government of the United States would
                            welcome the cooperation of the Brazilian Government in an effort to
                            check the present tendency toward such agreements.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States proposes as a basis for discussion
                            with the Brazilian Government, first, that there be written into the
                            trade agreement, or be made the subject of a separate agreement, clauses
                            reciprocally safeguarding the interests of the nationals and commerce of
                            the two countries in so far as they are now or may be affected by the
                            operation of any exchange control system, and all arrangements involving
                            the provision of exchange; and, second, that upon the conclusion of the
                            trade agreement, the two Governments join in a declaration of policy
                            with respect to clearing, compensation, and other similar
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the clauses regarding the operation of exchange control
                            to be written into the trade agreement, this Government suggests
                            provisions to the following effect: That the customs concessions and
                            other benefits provided for in the agreement are reciprocally granted on
                            the understanding that steps will be taken to insure that such
                            concessions and benefits will not be nullified by discriminations,
                            inequalities, or inequities in either country against the nationals or
                            trade of the other in connection with the operation of any exchange
                            control system or of any arrangement involving the provision of
                            exchange; and that in order to formulate the necessary measures to
                            insure the effectiveness of the preceding provision and to review the
                            operation of this section of the trade agreement, representatives of the
                            two Governments shall meet immediately on conclusion of the trade
                            agreement and quarterly thereafter, the Governments agreeing to make
                            available to each other all pertinent records and information.</p>

                        <p>With respect to the joint declaration referred to above, it is suggested
                            that the Governments of the United States and Brazil set forth therein
                            their intention to bend their best efforts to direct their commercial
                            policies in such a way as to discourage the multiplication of clearing,
                            compensation and other special agreements.</p>
                        <p>This Government recognizes that the policy reflected in these two
                            proposals is distinctly divergent from the policies recently pursued by
                            many important trading countries, which in many cases are endeavoring to
                            force upon countries with which they have an unfavorable balance of
                            trade provisions for offsetting purchases, which require that all or
                            part of the exchange proceeding from their imports be used for
                            reciprocal purchases within their territories. From the standpoint of
                            this country, the curtailment of imports into Brazil from the United
                            States, as a result of the limited amounts of foreign exchange allotted
                            for the purchase of American goods, and the long delays in payment now
                            being suffered by those who sell goods in Brazil, are regarded by many
                            American exporters and bankers as particularly onerous, in view of the
                            circumstance that American imports of Brazilian products, principally
                            coffee, create a volume of dollar exchange far in excess of the amount
                            required to pay in full all obligations due to American interests.
                            American holders of Brazilian bonds upon which service has been reduced
                            or suspended altogether, have vigorously asserted similar views.<note

                            therefore, the Government of the United States has explored fully the
                            possibility of proposing an agreement which would ensure prompt and full
                            payment for all merchandise shipped to Brazil and for the service of
                            Brazilian debts held by Americans. There can be no doubt that such an
                            agreement would be of immediate advantage to American exporters and
                            bondholders whose interests are preponderantly in Brazil. Nevertheless,
                            realization of the undesirability of the system of clearing and
                            compensation agreements as a long-run policy has caused the Government
                            of the United States to decline to adopt such a policy, as long as there
                            is any other solution of safeguarding the interests of the United States
                            such as that embodied in the proposal presented in the fourth paragraph
                            of this memorandum.</p>
                        <p>If satisfactory progress toward such a solution should prove to be
                            impossible, the United States, in order to secure itself against
                            inequality of treatment, might be compelled to seek arrangements whereby
                            exchange created by the sale of products in the United States would be
                            applied to the purchase of American goods and to the service of debts
                            owed to Americans. This it does not wish to do.</p>

                        <p>By refraining from such arrangements in connection with

                            the Governments of the United States and Brazil may help to check the
                            present tendency toward such agreements. A joint declaration to this
                            effect would, it is hoped, help to reverse the present trend of
                            international commercial policy by furnishing an example of
                            international agreement, between two of the most important countries in
                            this hemisphere, on a policy which looks toward the progressive removal
                            of the existing network of restrictions on international commerce—a
                            policy consistent not only with the best long-run economic interests of
                            the parties to the agreement themselves, but also of those of the whole
                            world.</p>
                        <p>This Government would ask the Brazilian Government to give most
                            sympathetic consideration to the judgments expressed above and to the
                            two proposals which have been submitted. It wishes to proceed with the
                            negotiations of a commercial agreement with Brazil with all expedition
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Aranha, the Brazilian Ambassador, called on Mr. Welles. Mr. Sayre,
                            Dr. Feis<note n="23" xml:id="d634fn23">Herbert Feis, Economic
                                Adviser.</note> and Mr. Wilson were present. (Mr. Sayre and Dr. Feis
                            part of the time).</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had not contemplated a formal meeting with a
                            large group to discuss the Department’s memorandum which he had received
                            only the day before, had cabled to his Government, and had, of course,
                            not yet heard from his Government in the matter. He had come in merely
                            to express certain views which had occurred to him.</p>
                        <p>First, as regards the trade agreement proper, Dr. Aranha said that he saw
                            no difficulties: Brazil already enjoyed practically all she desired in
                            the way of treatment of her goods by the United States; Brazil is
                            disposed to give the United States preferential treatment for American
                            goods if the United States so desires, or if the United States wishes
                            duties lowered on certain commodities, Brazil will do so, it being, of
                            course, understood that careful study should be made to determine that
                            any concession granted would in fact inure to the benefit of the United
                            States and would not place other countries in a position to increase
                            their sales to Brazil without benefit to the United <pb n="553"
                                xml:id="pg_553" facs="0623"/>States. It was explained to the
                            Ambassador that our program is based on the unconditional
                            most-favored-nation treatment which rules out preferences, and that the
                            concessions we are asking relate to products of which we are the
                            principal furnishers; our list of requests will be ready in a day or
                            so.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then turned to the other aspect of the problem between
                            Brazil and the United States, namely, the “financial” problem, as
                            described in our memorandum urging liberal policy in exchange matters.
                            Dr. Aranha said that this proposal was wholly in line with his own ideas
                            and policies; if the two countries, however, are to make a declaration
                            of liberal policy, they must in fact establish and carry out a liberal
                            policy, and he would be unwilling, and also certain the United States
                            Government would not desire, that after making such declaration Brazil
                            should in fact continue measures contrary thereto which would make the
                            declaration a meaningless gesture. He said that in his view a liberal
                            policy in Brazil would be inconsistent with governmental control over
                            exchanges and over coffee (the latter in relation to governmental
                            taxation on coffee which artificially maintained high prices); for
                            Brazil to enter in good faith into a declaration of liberal policy it
                            would be necessary for her to abolish these governmental controls. In
                            order to achieve this, there were certain problems which Brazil must
                            resolve, and these problems he understood as follows: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Exchange control;</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>

                                <item>Foreign debt.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Regarding (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) exchange control, Brazil must
                            abandon such control if she is in fact to pursue a liberal policy in
                            exchange matters; in other words, Brazil must divest herself of any
                            possibility of employing illiberal methods. To abolish exchange control
                            without risk to Brazil’s economy and finance, credits will be necessary.
                            Dr. Aranha said that he was not thinking in terms of a large
                            governmental credit, but solely in terms of credits extended by American
                            commercial banks. Prior to the depression American banks such as the
                            National City, Guaranty Trust, and Chase extended credits to the Bank of
                            Brazil and to other Brazilian banks, which facilitated trade between the
                            two countries. A resumption of such credits he regards as essential in
                            order to lift exchange control. During discussion of this point Dr.
                            Aranha said that with Brazilian exchange free to all countries, if any
                            country, such as Germany, impounded Brazilian credits, Brazil would
                            resist and would break off trade relations with that country—as Brazil
                            had done with France while he was Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>As regards (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) coffee, Dr. Aranha explained that
                            the Brazilian Government assesses taxation against each bag of coffee
                            exported in <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0624"/>the amount of
                            fifteen shillings: 5 shillings pledged to service of the coffee loan
                            (half of which, according to the Ambassador, is held in the United
                            States), and ten shillings for “coffee defense”. Governmental control
                            over coffee, as represented by the ten shilling taxes for “coffee
                            defense”, Dr. Aranha regards as inconsistent with a liberal policy: to
                            compensate, however, for revenue which would be lost to Brazil through
                            elimination of this tax, he proposed the following: The United States,
                            he said, imports annually a large amount of “deleterious” coffee, which
                            is harmful to the health; most of this comes from the Dutch East Indies,
                            although Brazil herself provides a considerable part of our imports of
                            this “harmful” coffee; this type of coffee is so bad that Brazil
                            prohibits its use in that country and Dr. Aranha was confident that
                            scientific tests would prove its noxious effect and that it should not
                            be admitted to this country. His thought was that if imports of such
                            coffee were prohibited, the added amount of good coffee to take its
                            place would come from Brazil and would compensate to Brazil what she
                            would lose by doing away with the ten shilling tax.</p>
                        <p>As regards (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the foreign debt, Dr. Aranha said
                            that Brazil would have to find, in order to carry out the general debt
                            plan, ten million pounds annually, which would have to be taken from the
                            commercial market. This, however, he recognized as a Brazilian
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Aranha said that, as would be indicated by his statements, he was
                            placing his cards on the table and speaking as frankly to us as he would
                            to his own people. Mr. Welles thanked him for his extremely interesting
                            statements, said that we would wish to consider them fully, and would
                            communicate with him, arranging for another conference to go further
                            into these matters, within the next few days.</p>

                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador called this morning accompanied by Dr.
                                Muniz.<note n="25" xml:id="d636fn25">João Carlos Muniz, Counselor of

                            who invited him to commence discussions on commodity schedules for the
                            new Trade Agreement. I handed the Ambassador the memorandum containing
                            the tariff concessions on commodities requested by the United

                            observed that we had increased our list materially over the list
                            presented last year. He said he preferred to study our memorandum and to
                            enable Dr. Muñiz to talk with Dr. Grady before presenting the
                            concessions requested by the Brazilian Government, which he remarked, in
                            any event, he had not yet received in final form from Rio.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador read me portions of a letter which he had received under
                            date of October 30th, from the President of Brazil regarding the
                            discussions with the German Mission in Kio.<note n="28"

                            stated that Mr. Souza Dantas<note n="29" xml:id="d636fn29">Exchange
                                Director of the Bank of Brazil.</note> was energetically supporting
                            the suggestion of the German Mission on the ground that if the agreement
                            proposed was not concluded, Brazil would lose a very important market
                            for certain Brazilian exports which the United States did not take,
                            particularly hides and cotton. The German Mission had likewise informed
                            the Brazilian Government that agreements similar to the one proposed had
                            been completed by Germany with almost all of the most important
                            countries of the world. The Ambassador remarked that he doubted this
                            assertion and I told him that Dr. Grady would be glad to give him such
                            information on this point as the Department had available. The letter
                            from President Vargas seemed to indicate considerable hesitancy as to
                            the policy which Brazil should pursue, namely, whether to go ahead with
                            Germany or to go ahead with the United States. It was obvious from this
                            letter that Dr. Aranha had been energetically upholding the American
                            point of view in his communications with President Vargas.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador referred to a statement published yesterday in the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, alleging that the Brazilian
                            Government had issued a communiqué to the press announcing the
                            conclusion of an agreement with Germany. He said that this was
                            completely untrue and gave me a copy of the official statement by the
                            Brazilian Government, which reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Brazilian and German Delegations have finished the studies
                                    which they have been carrying out respecting the best method of
                                    enhancing commercial intercourse between Brazil and Germany. The
                                    Delegations have informed their respective Governments of the
                                    results of their labors in order that the two Governments might
                                    reach a decision with regard thereto. The German Delegation will
                                    continue its journey within the next few days to Uruguay and to
                                    Chile. Meanwhile, commerce between the two countries will not be
                                    interrupted; commercial procedure continuing as at present
                                    without difficulty or impediments on either side.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I expressed my gratification to the Ambassador that the report in the <hi
                                rend="italic">New York Times</hi> was incorrect and that no decision
                            had as yet been reached by Brazil.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he hoped to receive, today or tomorrow, the decision
                            of his Government with regard to our proposal and that he would let me
                            know as soon as possible what this decision was.</p>

                        <p>Upon instruction of the Brazilian Ambassador, Mr. Muniz came in to see me
                            to get a statement of the American proposals in regard to the treatment
                            of the exchange control situation in the commercial treaty with Brazil.
                            I explained to him the general American attitude as summarized in the
                            memorandum presented to the Brazilian Ambassador, explaining the nature
                            of the provisions to be written into the agreement, and the nature and
                            purpose of the joint declaration. In regard to the provisions to be
                            written into the agreement, I explained that they would leave Brazil a
                            choice. If Brazil decided not to enter into any special agreements
                            providing immediate exchange (such as has been under discussion with
                            Germany) this country would ask no such treatment; if however Brazil
                            would enter into agreements conferring special exchange opportunity to
                            the trade of any other country, Brazil would be pledged to accord the
                            same treatment to American trade. Mr. Muniz professed to understand the
                            whole approach, to consider it very fair, and to favor it.</p>
                        <p>He then stated that he understood that we had proposed to the Brazilian
                            Government that they end the exchange control and had said that if they
                            did we would arrange any financial support that was necessary. I stated
                            that such was not my understanding. We would not want to accept the
                            responsibility of taking the initiative in this matter. Our hope was
                            that the course of Brazilian affairs and the drift of decision on the
                            part of the Brazilian Government would lead to the termination of the
                            exchange control. If the Brazilian Government wished to take such action
                            and wanted to ask this Government to facilitate the action, I was sure
                            we would be glad to examine the possibilities with care.</p>
                        <p>Since this different emphasis continued to puzzle him, I checked the
                            statement over with Mr. Welles in his presence, and Mr. Welles,
                            confirmed it saying, however, that as a matter of fact in conversation
                            with the Brazilian Ambassador during the past day or two he had gone a
                            bit further and stated he had felt hopeful we would be able to give
                            financial facilitation. This I told Mr. Muniz. The matter was left that
                            he would communicate with me as soon as decision had been reached by his
                            Government.</p>

                            it is the hope and intention of the Brazilian Government to proceed as
                            rapidly as the difficulties of the problem permit with the gradual
                            relinquishment of exchange control. It will be the hope of the
                            Government of the United States that, upon the satisfactory conclusion
                            of the present negotiations, the Government of Brazil will be willing,
                            by means of a note addressed to the Government of the United States, to
                            indicate its intentions in this regard.</p>

                            <head><hi rend="italic">Draft Joint Declaration of Policy With Respect
                                    to Clearing and Compensation Agreements</hi></head>
                            <p>The current trends in commercial policy throughout the world are
                                indicative of the disorganization of the international price
                                structure and of the maladjustments that prevail in international
                                financial and trade relations. The difficulties of maintaining a
                                balance of international payments, the breakdown of fixed exchange
                                relations incident to the deepening of the depression, and the lack
                                of equilibrium in international costs and prices have caused
                                countries to develop direct measures of control of trade and foreign
                                exchange. These measures have not been consciously designed as a
                                general or ultimate solution of international economic relations.
                                They have been resorted to in order to deal with concrete problems
                                such as the disturbance to trade balances, unemployment, and falling
                                prices. Nevertheless the effect has been that through quota
                                restrictions, governmental trading monopolies, import licensing,
                                exchange control, clearing and compensation agreements, the
                                principle of equality is rapidly being superseded by preferential
                                treatment.</p>
                            <p>In particular, clearing and compensation agreements tend to reduce
                                the volume of triangular trade, and have thus contributed to the
                                disastrous decline in total world commerce. Moreover, they tend to
                                divert purchases from the best markets and to force the importation
                                of goods which are less urgently required. This diversion of trade
                                from its established channels has not only intensified the
                                disturbance to international economic relations but also tends to
                                engender international ill-will.</p>
                            <p>In these circumstances, the Governments of the United States and
                                Brazil, in cooperation with each other, desire to direct their
                                commercial policies in such a manner as to discourage the
                                multiplication of agreements of this character. They recognize that
                                the policy herein reflected is distinctly divergent from the
                                policies recently pursued by many important trading countries, and
                                that the line of action proposed may involve some sacrifice of
                                immediate interest. Nevertheless, realization of the defects of the
                                system of clearing and compensation agreements as a long-run policy
                                has caused the Governments of the <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568"
                                    facs="0638"/>United States and Brazil to refrain from adopting
                                such a policy, as long as there is any other solution in terms of
                                non-discrimination, equality, and most-favored-nation treatment such
                                as that embodied in the trade agreement which they have just
                                concluded.</p>
                            <p>By refraining from clearing or compensation arrangements in
                                connection with Brazilian-American trade, and in their relations
                                with other countries, the Governments of the United States and
                                Brazil hope to facilitate the progressive removal of the existing
                                network of restrictions on international commerce. They venture to
                                declare this policy in the belief that it is consistent not only
                                with the best long-run economic interests of the parties to the
                                agreement themselves, but also of those of the whole world. They
                                believe that the general interest will be served if, as rapidly as
                                circumstances will permit, nations cooperate in an effort to
                                reestablish the functioning of an international price system, with
                                freedom from exchange control and from quantitative restrictions,
                                and with tariffs considerably reduced below the abnormally high
                                level established in nearly all countries in recent years.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Muniz, who is serving as special assistant to the Brazilian
                            Ambassador in connection with the commercial agreement negotiations,
                            came in to see me yesterday in order to discuss informally various
                            topics connected with commercial negotiations.</p>
                        <p>First of all he asked for information in connection with the reported
                            deal for the sale of American cotton to Germany.<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d640fn31">See <ref target="frus1934v02#pg_400">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, pp. 400</ref> ff.</note> He said
                            that this transaction was of certain interest to the Brazilian
                            Government because as we knew they had been in discussion with the
                            German Government, and had deferred any agreement pending the outcome of
                            our discussions with them. If we were going to enter into such an
                            agreement it naturally would have an effect on their action.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I was not informed as to the standing of the particular
                            proposal, and since the matter seemed to bear so directly on all of our
                            proposals to Brazil, I thought it advisable that he talk directly to Mr.
                            Sayre. The talk was therefore continued in Mr. Sayre’s Office, Mr. Grady
                            joining it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre stated that while a proposal had been formulated and was under
                            discussion between groups in the two countries it had not yet been
                            agreed upon or put into effect. He added that for Mr. Muniz’s own
                            information, this proposal had not originated in the Department, and it
                            was not the type of trade arrangement which seemed to the <pb n="569"
                                xml:id="pg_569" facs="0639"/>Department to fit into its trade
                            policy; but he could not say at the present moment whether it would or
                            would not be effectuated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Muniz explained that it seemed to him the same type of transaction
                            the Brazilian Government was being pressed to enter into by various
                            European countries. The talk broadened from this matter to the general
                            questions of policy formulated in the drafts presented by us to the
                            Brazilian Government of a commercial agreement (especially with regard
                            to the exchange control provision of the agreement) and the joint
                            declaration of policy which it was proposed to issue after the signature
                            of the agreement. Mr. Muniz implied that such a transaction as this one
                            dealing with cotton would seem to contradict the leading idea in the
                            proposed joint declaration. It was admitted by us that this was the
                            case, and the thought was expressed that there might have to be a few
                            actions in the opposite direction from the policy which might still be
                            maintained as a main principle.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Muniz then continued to reiterate, though always with courteous
                            regret, that it seemed to him that the policy that would be embodied in
                            the joint declaration would make it very difficult if not impossible for
                            Brazil to maintain its trade with Europe, and that what would seem to
                            suit Brazil best was an arrangement that would protect American
                            interests fully and still permit Brazil to maintain its European
                            markets. Mr. Sayre and Mr. Grady both admitted a certain difficulty and
                            risk for Brazil in entering upon the policy represented by the joint
                            declaration. They pointed out, however, and Mr. Muniz understood, that
                            the declaration represented an attempt to check the spread of the
                            European policy of clearing and compensation agreements, and to give a
                            lead to the world in the opposite direction; if a certain amount of risk
                            of loss of trade with Europe was involved, the two countries would have
                            to be prepared to run the risk and make a determined effort to modify
                            world trends which, if it succeeded, would serve the commerce of both
                            countries better than the present trade. Since Mr. Muniz continued to
                            return to the problems presented to Brazil it was suggested that the
                            most useful thing that could be done at this stage would be if those
                            problems could be presented concretely, country by country, so that both
                            parties could really weigh them and see if some solution to them could
                            not be found compatible with the general principle embodied in the joint
                            declaration. It was agreed that Mr. Muniz and Mr. Grady should meet the
                            following day to run over these problems case by case.</p>
                        <p>The conversation naturally also touched upon the provisional decree
                            issued by the Brazilian Government, to be effective beginning December
                                10,<note n="32" xml:id="d640fn32">See telegram No. 330, December 4,

                            the proceeds of coffee sales to each country in rough percentage to the

                            by sales in each country. From his remarks I received the impression
                            that certainly one purpose that had moved the Brazilian Government was
                            to bring pressure on those countries, particularly Great Britain, who
                            sold Brazil much more than they bought from Brazil. Resistance was
                            anticipated by Great Britain and this fact was confirmed by cables
                            received from George Gordon in Rio this morning.<note n="33"

                        <p>Mr. Muniz is apparently trying to form judgments on all aspects of the
                            situation for the purpose of advising his Government what response to

                        <p>As agreed at the meeting on December 6 [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>], Mr.
                            Muniz and Mr. Penteado of the Brazilian Embassy<note n="34"
                                xml:id="d641fn34">Eurico Penteado, Administrator General of the
                                Brazilian Coffee Department, designated to assist the Brazilian
                                Embassy in reciprocal trade agreement negotiations.</note> called on
                            me Thursday, December 6, to discuss further the extent to which the
                            joint statement to be issued at the time of the proclamation of the
                            Brazilian-American trade agreement is to be interpreted as precluding
                            any types of arrangements which the Brazilian Government may make with
                            European Governments to protect their trade with Europe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Muniz repeated what he had said in the conversations on December 5,
                            that the Brazilian Government felt that it would be impelled to make
                            some forms of clearing arrangements with Germany and Great Britain, and
                            he wished to ascertain informally whether these would be in violation of
                            the joint declaration or of the agreement. We requested, in our
                            conversations on December 5, that he indicate to me what was
                            contemplated in these agreements. He did not seem to have any
                            information of a concrete nature to supplement his conversations of the
                            day before. He expressed his belief that clearing arrangements could be
                            made with both Germany and Great Britain without prejudice to American
                            interests, and suggested the possibility of Brazil’s action in regard to
                            such agreements being checked at the quarterly meetings between
                            representatives of the two Governments, provided for in the proposed
                            draft of our agreement with Brazil.</p>
                        <p>He questioned me further as to the discussed cotton arrangement between
                            Germany and American interests, but I could give him no definite answer
                            as to whether that plan would or would not be carried out.</p>
                        <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0641"/>
                        <p>I again suggested it would help us in considering this matter if he could
                            indicate concretely what was contemplated in the way of commodity
                            exchange in connection with the clearing arrangements his Government has
                            in mind with Great Britain and Germany. He left with the understanding
                            that we should meet in a few days, and I expressed the hope that he
                            could furnish us at that time with more concrete information as to what
                            was contemplated by his Government than he has so far given us.</p>

                            my request to go over the list of suggestions handed by the Brazilian
                            Ambassador to Mr. Welles.<note n="36" xml:id="d642fn36">Not
                                printed.</note> The Brazilian Committee has been studying this list
                            and has certain questions in its mind regarding it which it would like
                            to clear up. It is for this purpose I asked Mr. Muniz to come and sit
                            down with Mr. Daniels, Chairman of the Brazilian Committee. He brought
                            Mr. Konder with him.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the conversation Mr. Muniz indicated a somewhat
                            different point of view than that he expressed in my last conversations
                            with him. He urged an early statement from our Government as to whether
                            the proposed cotton arrangement with Germany is going through or not. He
                            said that as soon as we can officially assure the Brazilian Ambassador
                            as to this matter, the details of the Brazilian agreement can be quickly
                            worked out. He distinctly gave me the impression, which I did not gather
                            in my last conversation with him, that the Brazilian Government would
                            not press the matter of its own clearing agreements with Great Britain
                            and Germany if we do not go forward with our cotton deal with Germany. I
                            assured him that we would advise him as soon as we had definite word on
                            the cotton agreement.</p>

                        <p>I —The study of the present situation of constantly increasing reduction
                            of world exchange shows that it is necessary to attempt another <pb
                                n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0642"/>policy than the one which is
                            being practiced for the purpose of reestablishing commercial life
                            between countries.</p>
                        <p>II —The reduction of the purchasing power of the nations, with
                            under-consumption, the anarchy of currencies, together with exchange
                            problems, the lack of credits, together with the paralysis of business,
                            and many other factors have already compelled the making of 142
                            compensation agreements between the European nations and some American
                            nations.</p>
                        <p>III —These agreements contemplate the establishment of a regime of barter
                            for the purpose of bringing commercial balances as well as payments to
                            an equilibrium at the expense of countries which have balances or have
                            credits.</p>
                        <p>IV —Various countries harassed by the reduction of the value of their
                            commerce or by their financial necessities began by adopting high
                            tariffs, favors granted to exports, quotas for imports, exchange
                            discriminations, currency devaluations, domestic measures regarding
                            production, some countries even going so far as a practical monopoly of
                            foreign commerce.</p>
                        <p>V —No country failed to fall more or less into a policy of emergency or
                            of expedients, both with regard to domestic commerce and with regard to
                            foreign commerce. England, the traditional free trade country, made the
                            Ottawa agreement,<note n="38" xml:id="d643fn38"><hi rend="italic"

                            There is not a single country which, more or less, under these
                            circumstances, has not tried experiments in the sense of giving a
                            direction to its economy and to its domestic and foreign commerce.</p>
                        <p>VI —This emergency policy, which, as we see, caused the further
                            aggravation of the universal situation, by reducing the volume and value
                            of commerce, threatens to change from being a mere expedient into
                            becoming a true and almost unanimous rule, norm, or basis of exchange
                            between peoples.</p>
                        <p>VII —The United States of America, seeing the injuries which that rule is
                            causing to international relations and in its own relations, now wishes
                            to make an effort to eliminate from commercial practice all and every
                            expedient involving a derogation from the so-called liberal policy. It
                            expects to count on Brazil whose situation in world commerce <pb n="573"
                                xml:id="pg_573" facs="0643"/>is, in many respects, the same as her
                            own, and which has balances in its commerce with the United States of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>VIII —It is necessary first to emphasize the diversity of position of our
                            countries, which diversity is of capital importance in the problem: <list>

                            whole effort is made and shall be made in the sense of return to the
                            liberal policies and of the closest understanding with the United States
                            of America. However, she wants the consequences of this attitude to be
                            evident in her economy and in relations with other countries.</p>
                        <p>X —The adoption of the inflexible liberal policy, such as is traced in
                            the projected treaty, will involve, as it has already involved, in
                            practice, the suspension of our commerce with those countries which,
                            like Germany, Italy, and many others, on the basis of domestic measures,
                            upon which measures it is impossible to bring any influence to bear,
                            only purchase from Brazil in order to sell.</p>
                        <p>XI —Now, Brazil has, with those countries, 57 percent of her global
                            commerce and is not able, because of domestic reasons, to renounce that
                            commerce, either altogether or in part. The United States of America,
                            for her part, can do so, but with inevitable repercussions at home which
                            we are already feeling in the case of cotton and in other cases.</p>

                        <p>XIII —Besides this consequence of loss to the production of the United
                            States of America and of Brazil of exports to the approximate value of
                            210 millions of dollars, there is a more serious fact: the business
                            which ceases to be done between our countries is going to be done with
                            other countries on the basis of compensation.</p>
                        <p>XIV —It is, therefore, beyond dispute that, by ceasing to sell to those
                            countries, we shall be fortifying the policy which we wish to condemn,
                            since we shall furnish a greater margin of exchange—that which we cease
                            to effect—to feed the compensating countries.</p>

                                <item>The adoption of a liberal policy, for such a policy is the one

                                <item>The establishment, nevertheless, of norms to be adopted during
                                    the period of transition so as to prevent the simple doctrinaire
                                    adoption of orientation from effecting the opposite of our
                                    purposes.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>XVI —The norms would be those of an aggressive sales policy in order to
                            destroy the constantly increasing bloc of countries parties to
                            compensation treaties. This policy, with the direct participation of the
                            Government, would be carried out through banks or domestic credit
                            operations or even combinations between banks or firms of the interested
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>It would disappear with the return to commercial normality, with
                            multi-angular exchange, with the inevitable adherence of other countries
                            to these purposes.</p>
                        <p>XVII —If this action appears anti-liberal—something which does not so
                            appear to me in view of the universal situation—the attitude of the
                            United States of America might be maintained for some time but that of
                            Brazil could not last, since Brazil has no reserves and does have
                            debts.</p>
                        <p>XVIII —A practice such as the liberal practice which has been virtually
                            renounced by almost all countries cannot be reestablished offhand. It
                            does not depend on an idea, on a declaration, on an attitude, on a
                            treaty between two countries. In order to be reestablished it is
                            necessary for it to pass through the crisis of all reconstructions. It
                            will have to be a patient work of effort and of action, sometimes using
                            old material and sometimes using new material.</p>
                        <p>XIX —It cannot, therefore, be done by <hi rend="italic">fiat</hi>. It is
                            necessary that we should join action and idea, that we should organize a
                            program, that we should follow a method, that we should mobilize
                            resources without which the failure of our effort will weigh upon the

                        <p>Mr. Muniz came in to see me by appointment. He told me that they had now
                            received word from their Government regarding the commercial agreement
                            text as at present drawn up. He did not yet have the materials ready in
                            regard to the commodity schedules but had been asked by the Ambassador
                            to discuss various points raised by his Government in regard to the
                            general clauses, preparatory to a visit of the Ambassador with Mr.
                            Welles tomorrow. He stated that his Government has raised questions
                            regarding the following articles of the agreement (numbered as in the
                            latest draft):</p>
                        <p>(1)—and foremost. He said that his Government feared that the inclusion
                            of Article 6 (the exchange control article) would jeopardize the passage
                            of the agreement through Congress. He gave no reasons except (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) it feared Congress would not understand and in
                            its present mood of nationalism object, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) That
                            there is no chance that Brazil will discriminate as shown by the recent
                            action of the Bank of Brazil. Muniz kept repeating that his Government
                            wanted an agreement and therefore would not want anything in it that
                            would jeopardize its passage.</p>
                        <p>I explained that protection in the foreign exchange field was one of the
                            purposes that we would seek to deal with in every treaty, that we had
                            been pressed to seek special advantage in Brazil, and that if we
                            provided no explicit safeguards in this field, we would be subjected to
                            much criticism. The present exchange regulations of the Bank of Brazil
                            is a unilateral action which might be modified at any time. This whole
                            field was to us a vital matter.</p>
                        <p>Finally, after various repetitions of his remarks, he said that an idea
                            had come to him just then, that the clause might be taken out of the
                            agreement, might then be presented to Congress and be handled in an
                            exchange of notes. This would avoid delay of passage of the
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>I repeatedly made clear I was in no position to take any action on this
                            point but promised fully to inform Mr. Welles. I had the distinct
                            impression that Mr. Muniz was more or less on his own initiative in
                            trying to get Article VI straightened out in order to clear the way for
                            special arrangements to be worked through the Bank of Brazil and that he
                            had come down to try out our position. I spared no effort to bring home
                            to him how important the matter appeared to us,</p>
                        <p>(2) The Brazilian Government requested the suppression of the first
                            paragraph of Article III (which guaranteed reciprocally <pb n="576"
                                xml:id="pg_576" facs="0646"/>“national” treatment as regards
                            internal taxes, fees, et cetera, on imported articles). He stated that
                            there were three or four commodities in which the imported article was
                            subjected to higher taxes than the domestic one and that the clause as
                            drafted would compel amendment of their fiscal legislation.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was in no position to pass any judgment on this Article
                            but it occurred to me that if the whole difficulty lay in the few
                            differential excise taxes already in excess, it is conceivable that an
                            exception might be made of those.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Brazilian Government asked the omission of the first paragraph of
                            Article X (in which the Governments pledged themselves not to apply more
                            than nominal penalties in the case of errors in documentations,
                            obviously clerical, and where good faith can be established). He said
                            his Government knew its system was somewhat defective but that imports
                            and the revenue therefrom was of the utmost importance to it and that
                            this would compel amendment of their present fiscal measures—a matter
                            which might seriously impede the presentation of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>(4) His Government asked inclusion of an additional paragraph in Article
                            IX containing the recommendations of the Seventh Pan American Commercial

                        <p>On the afternoon of March 7th, Mr. Eugene P. Thomas, President of the
                            National Foreign Trade Council, accompanied by Mr. Richard P. Momsen,
                            Chairman of the Legislation Committee of the American Chamber of
                            Commerce for Brazil, spent some time in my office.</p>

                            received by the firms signing the frozen milreis agreement with

                            Oliveira and Valentin Boucas, had agreed would be attended to as soon as
                            the agreement mentioned had been signed,<note n="44" xml:id="d646fn44"

                            a consequence of these excessive imports, since June 1933, a sum of
                            frozen milreis totaling about $25,000,000 had accumulated in Brazil. Mr.
                            Thomas, when discussing this situation recently with Mr. Boucas, was
                            informed by the latter that the matter could be arranged by another
                            funding agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thomas also stated that the Council of Inter-American Relations
                            Incorporated was requesting from all its members a statement of the
                            accumulation of frozen milreis during the last six or seven months, and
                            intended, upon the receipt of this information, to request from Dr.
                            Figueiredo, Director of the Exchange Control, a statement as to its
                            future policy in allocating exchange. He added that Mr. Kent,<note
                                n="45" xml:id="d646fn45">Supervisor of Exchange, Federal Reserve
                                Bank of New York.</note> prior to his resignation, had requested a
                            monthly statement from Dr. Figueiredo as to his allocation of exchange
                            to various nationalities, <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0649"/>but
                            that Dr. Figueiredo had paid no attention to this request. The Council
                            had then asked the American Chamber of Commerce for Brazil to take up
                            this matter and to see whether they could not get some information along
                            this line from him. The Chamber had been averse to acting in this matter
                            due to the possibility that Dr. Figueiredo would take umbrage and the
                            various members of the Chamber would find the repercussion
                            disadvantageous.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thomas also expressed the opinion that the Council of Inter-American
                            Relations would be very happy to see the Department send a
                            representative to Rio de Janeiro to talk over the question of frozen
                            milreis with competent Brazilian authorities. He was of the opinion that
                            such a representative should cooperate with various local bodies in Rio
                            de Janeiro representing American interests and also with the
                            representative of the Council of Inter-American Relations who would
                            probably be sent to Rio de Janeiro during the visit of the Department’s
                            representative.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Dr. Feis</hi>: Referring to the conversations
                            you and Mr. Sloan have had with Messrs. E. P. Thomas, E. Momsen and the
                            undersigned on the subject of Brazilian Exchange, we outline the present
                            situation resulting from replies to our circular of January 19th
                                attached,<note n="48" xml:id="d648fn48">Not printed.</note> and
                            other information which will furnish the basis of a letter to Mr. Marcos
                            Souza Dantas, Brazilian Controller of Exchange.</p>
                        <pb n="580" xml:id="pg_580" facs="0650"/>
                        <p>As of record, on June 17th, 1933 we negotiated an agreement with the
                            Brazilian Government under the terms of which approximately fourteen
                            millions of dollars immobilized in Brazil were converted into dollar
                            obligations. Approximately 10% of this amount, and representing holders
                            of balances in amounts less than $50,000, were to be paid within 90
                            days. An extension of a further 90 days, under an option, was
                            subsequently taken by Brazil for meeting a part of the cash payments,
                            but some payments under this category have to date not been satisfied.
                            As to this last mentioned situation, the attached copy of letter to Mr.
                            Souza gives further particulars.<note n="49" xml:id="d648fn49">Not found
                                in Department files.</note> The balance of approximately 90% of the
                            $14,000,000 was covered by the issuance of 72 notes payable monthly over
                            six years with proportionate monthly payments as to amortization, and
                            interest at 6% per annum. This service has been met in full since the
                            date of its inception.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate your concern over the present and future position of
                            American interests exporting to Brazil; as also those having investments
                            in Brazilian public utilities and branch plants; insofar as they are
                            affected by the difficulty of obtaining dollar exchange to liquidate
                            sales and for the transfer of accrued profits arising from
                            investments.</p>
                        <p>In the negotiation of reciprocal trade agreements it is understood that
                            attention will be given to the subject of adequate provision of
                            exchange, as otherwise the expected benefits to American exports may be
                            rendered ineffective. A copy of our telegram of November 10th, 1933 to
                            Secretary Hull is attached,<note n="50" xml:id="d648fn50">Not
                                printed.</note> as pertinent to this subject.</p>
                        <p>The American exporter cannot afford to jeopardize his capital to finance
                            shipments, if the recovery of the value is problematical or unduly
                            prolonged.</p>
                        <p>The Brazilian Government insisted on the insertion of a clause in the
                            Agreement of June 17th to the effect that signatories to the Agreement
                            would receive preferential consideration in connection with their future
                            exchange requirements. This was later generalized to include all
                            American interests. There have been no signs of special consideration
                            having been shown, however, as overdue exchange now exceeds Five Million
                            Dollars. Unofficially the ingenuous suggestion is offered of negotiating
                            a further “forced loan”.</p>
                        <p>Brazil has a very large and favorable balance in her trade with the
                            United States—$53,000,000 in 1933, $53,500,000 in 1932 and $81,600,000
                            in 1931. We purchased an excess in value of over three times more of
                            Brazilian products than Brazil purchased from the United States.
                            However, whereas Brazilian products are paid for, Americans have had to
                            wait, and are still waiting, for a considerable portion of their money.
                            Comparisons are frequently offered of the beneficial effects <pb n="581"

                            the viewpoint, that the State Department may properly take cognizance of
                            the exchange situation in favor of American interests selling to or
                            having industrial investments in Brazil, and especially to the balance
                            of payments.</p>

                            milreis in Brazil belonging to American nationals had to seek protection
                            against further depreciation by accepting upwards of $14,000,000 of
                            deferred dollar obligations. The accumulation since the signing of the
                            agreement of an amount in excess of $5,000,000 by the same signers of
                            the Agreement, also the suggestion that they resort to the “grey”
                            exchange market in order to repatriate their funds—which action calls
                            for a monetary loss—should have official attention in any discussions of
                            reciprocal trade agreements with Brazil.</p>
                        <p>We would like to see, in the interest both of American and Brazilian
                            trade, a proper exchange control and the elimination of “grey” exchange.
                            Our nationals are not receiving the consideration due us as the creators
                            of the bulk of the foreign exchange arising from Brazilian exports. Some
                            of our correspondents have suggested a plan whereby a fixed proportion
                            of our purchases of Brazilian products shall be paid for out of the
                            blocked funds of American nationals in Brazil. We do suggest that means
                            be sought to prevent the accumulation of new blocked balances, by
                            definite agreement with Brazil before the reciprocal trade agreement is
                            ratified.</p>
                        <p>The proper method to be employed by Brazil under existing conditions is
                            the licensing of imports, with guarantee of the availability of exchange
                            as specified in the corresponding license. In this way Brazil could
                            adjust the class and quantity of imports to the country’s requirements
                            and the anticipated supply of exchange. While this plan is somewhat
                            similar, up to this point, to that adopted by Argentina, we deprecate
                            the adoption of the additional Argentine policy whereby imports from any
                            country are limited to that country’s purchases of Argentine products.
                            The British fostered the Argentine scheme as a means of increasing their
                            trade, especially at the expense of the United States. The adoption of
                            such a plan by the United States is inadvisable. Through the licensing
                            of imports, however, it would be possible to guard against any
                            discriminatory action taken against American interests.</p>
                        <p>The opinion seems to persist in the minds of some Brazilians that a means
                            for obtaining necessary financing is through periodic “forced <pb
                                n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0652"/>loans” of immobilized milreis,
                            more especially those belonging to American interests. The traditional
                            influence and control by British interests of Brazil’s foreign financial
                            structure undoubtedly places us at a disadvantage at the present time in
                            all economic and exchange matters, particularly with a lack of control
                            of imports, secrecy in the available volume and allocation of exchange
                            and the functioning of the “grey” exchange market.</p>
                        <p>We welcome, therefore, the reported intention of the State Department to
                            have one of its officials sojourn in Brazil for a sufficient time to
                            study the situation and take appropriate action, in concert with
                            American trade and investment interests, to alleviate the present
                            unstable situation.</p>

                        <p>On Monday, April 2, Mr. Edwin C. Wilson, Chief of the Latin-American
                            Division, and myself, took Mr. Boucas over to a conference with Mr.
                                Peek<note n="52" xml:id="d649fn52">George Nelson Peek, Special
                                Adviser to the President on Foreign Trade and President of the
                                Export-Import Bank.</note> with regard to the direction of the
                            exchange situation as between ourselves and Brazil. Mr. Boucas outlined
                            very generally and tentatively an idea whereunder if one of the
                            Export-Import Banks would be in a position to extend to the Bank of
                            Brazil a certain revolving credit of about nine months’ duration, then
                            the Bank of Brazil might be willing to arrange as security for this
                            credit—that some or all of the dollar exchange arising out of the sales
                            of coffee in this country should be turned over to the Export-Import
                            Bank which could then use it for the discharge of its credit. This might
                            form a method of securing more advantageous treatment and increased
                            opportunities for American export trade under the exchange control.</p>
                        <p>The idea seems to contain a genuine possibility deserving further study.
                            Mr. Peek said that the third Export-Import Bank, the one that would
                            engage in general trade operations, had not yet been created but as soon
                            as it was attention would be paid to this possibility.</p>

                            both from official and private sources, as to the treatment accorded <pb

                            Brazilian exchange control. As an example of divergence compare report
                            of American Consul General at Rio No. 381 of March 15 with parts of
                            special report No. 25 of Commercial Attaché of March 16.<note n="53"

                        <p>Therefore though Embassy and Consul General have sent much comment and
                            information on current trend from time to time, the Department feels
                            serious need of comprehensive and thorough report on the whole subject
                            drawing upon the official records. This report ought to enable the

                            they take immediate steps to furnish me with full information as to
                            present status of exchange question, together with recommendations based
                            on their experience. Despite their direct interest they have only today
                            agreed upon drafting of questionnaire to be sent to members. I find
                            great divergence of opinion among Americans as to what should be done. I
                            have, however, independently made a general canvas of American firms and
                            am gathering considerable amount of information.</p>
                        <p>Brazilian authorities have repeatedly promised information which is not
                            yet forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing merely to reassure Department that matter is receiving
                            attention of Consul General, Commercial Attaché and Embassy.</p>

                        <p>102. Department’s 36, April 6 [<hi rend="italic">9</hi>], 4 p.m. I had
                            expected to send full report on exchange situation by today’s air
                            service but in view of developments of last few days have been unable to
                            complete it; it will go forward in next air mail.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime I had prepared a preliminary telegraphic report as called
                            for in the Department’s telegram but on submitting it to the Consul
                            General he informs me that he disagrees with statement of <pb n="585"
                                xml:id="pg_585" facs="0655"/>some of the essential facts and the
                            conclusions and that he is in possession of evidence of discrimination
                            against American interests and preferential treatment accorded other
                            nationalities. I feel that in view of this I must withhold any
                            comprehensive report until the Consul General’s information can be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of the time which has elapsed since the Department
                            called for this information, I feel that I should no longer delay in
                            giving my own impression, which is shared by the Commercial Attaché, of
                            the administration of foreign exchange control, tempered with a
                            statement that the Consul General disagrees as above indicated, and
                            subject to amendment in the light of his information.</p>
                        <p>After following situation closely for 10 months I believe that the new
                            Exchange Director of the Bank of Brazil is making an honest effort to
                            put exchange control on a businesslike basis. He has already taken
                            several measures which meet complaints of American business interests,
                            for instance from June 1st all drafts must be numbered to ensure
                            chronological treatment and thus obviate favoritism. A further decree
                            authorizes free trading in all exchange not derived from exports.</p>
                        <p>As regards the frequent charges of corruption, Dr. Souza Dantas has come
                            out with a letter to a newspaper which has attacked the conduct of
                            exchange control stating that he does not propose to tolerate
                            corruption, discrimination or preference, that the records of the Bank
                            are open to them and that he will take action on any evidence they can
                            bring in as to improper activities by the Bank or its employees.</p>
                        <p>Pending consideration of the various possible solutions submitted in the
                            written report, I propose, unless the Department directs otherwise, to
                            go over the whole exchange problem informally with the Minister of
                            Finance and the Exchange Director in the light of recent developments
                            and stress to them the further improvement which would result if they
                            could accelerate dollar remittances for current requirements, as the
                            chief complaint now put forth is delay in receiving cash after maturity
                            of drafts.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it would be helpful to have for my guide [<hi
                                rend="italic">guidance?</hi>] a list of complaints received by the
                                Department.<note n="54" xml:id="d652fn54">A list of complaints

                        <p>The long delay in formulating report is due in large measure to the
                            difficulty in securing from Americans here precise information as to
                            their exchange experience and present status together with conflict of
                            opinion as to course best calculated to improve situation.</p>

                        <p>We are agreed that knowledge here that our Government was making inquiry
                            into this subject has had a distinctly helpful influence. While it is
                            too early to pronounce judgment, there are hopeful indications of
                            improved treatment of American interests. Minister of Finance and new
                            Director of Exchange Control have been brought into direct contact with
                            a series of groups chosen by the American Chamber of Commerce and while
                            nothing specific has yet been agreed upon the Minister has recognized
                            need for definite measures.</p>
                        <p>Mail report consummates a series of possible solutions indicating their
                            advantages and disadvantages but, in view of what we hope may prove to
                            be favorable developments, we are disposed to recommend concentration
                            for the time being on possibilities of improvement through friendly
                            agreement with a view to reducing the lag in furnishing exchange upon
                            matters of drafts which would meet the most pressing complaint of
                            American interests. Other adjustments will probably be possible through
                            discussion here. It will probably take several months to judge the
                            results of this course but in any event this would not prejudice such
                            further action as may later be decided upon by the Department.</p>

                            the Brazilian authorities an understanding which will protect and help

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            concerning a series of contracts for armaments and equipment which were
                            recently signed by the Ministry of War.</p>
                        <p>It is reported that the Ministry has signed contracts with armament firms
                            in Czechoslovakia for approximately $3,000,000 covering rifles, heavy
                            armaments and shells. Another contract was signed with a concern in
                            Sweden manufacturing the Matson machine gun for approximately
                            $2,000,000. Another contract was signed with manufacturers in Holland
                            for Zeiss sighting equipment for approximately $650,000. Concerns in
                            Belgium and Germany received contracts amounting to approximately
                            $2,000,000 for material for a projectile factory and forging shop. But
                            one contract was placed in the United States and that for about $100,000
                            with Niles Machine Tool Company. It is understood that this contract is
                            for precision machinery.</p>
                        <p>I have been informed that practically all of these contracts originally
                            provided for part payment with the order, part payment before shipment
                            and from 25% to 35% of the balance after inspection and acceptance in
                            Brazil. The Minister of Finance, however, is said to have called in the
                            representatives of various concerns with whom the contracts had been
                            made and after pointing out that it was impossible <pb n="589"
                                xml:id="pg_589" facs="0659"/>for the Government to make cash or
                            immediate payments as prescribed, suggested that they accept the notes
                            of the Bank of Brazil bearing interest at 4% and payable monthly over a
                            period of seventy-two months. The suppliers objected to this on the
                            grounds that its prices had been based on very definite terms and that
                            in some cases the materials were already packed for shipment. The
                            Minister then advised the factories’ representatives that he would not
                            sanction the transactions unless they accepted the Bank of Brazil’s
                            notes over a period of five years. It is understood, however, that the
                            Czecho-slovakian suppliers would be permitted to draw against
                            accumulated Brazilian credits in Czechoslovakia for immediate payment up
                            to the extent of those credits.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after receipt of the above mentioned information, a member of the
                            Embassy staff called upon Dr. Marcos Souza Dantas, Exchange Director of
                            the Bank of Brazil, and discussed in a friendly manner the question of
                            the purchase of armaments in European countries in its relation to the
                            exchange problem. Dr. Souza Dantas stated that within the last few years
                            the Brazilian Government had been accumulating large credit balances in
                            various European countries. He stated that these credits had been
                            definitely blocked by the various governments and that really, for all
                            practical purposes, they do not represent an available supply of
                            exchange for the Bank of Brazil. He further stated that he had proposed
                            to the American creditors of the Bank of Brazil the transference to
                            their accounts of those European credits, but that his offer had been
                            refused. He also stated that, of course, so far as he and the Minister
                            of Finance were concerned, they looked upon such expenditures with great
                            misgivings, but that this is a matter over which they have no control.
                            He again pointed out that, in a measure, this was simply a means of
                            liquidating Brazil’s frozen assets in the countries in question.</p>
                        <p>While it is believed that the Brazilian Government has blocked credits in
                            Czechoslovakia and Germany it is not known whether such credits exist in
                            Sweden and Belgium.</p>
                        <p>One school of thought here believes that by using the blocked credits
                            known to exist in Czechoslovakia which are sufficient to meet the
                            requirements of the suppliers, the Brazilian Government is favoring
                            nations which withhold remittances for Brazilian sales at the expense of
                            countries such as the United States, which has followed a policy of free
                            exchange movement.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that it appears to be the definite policy of the
                            Department to discourage the purchase of armaments, I did not feel
                            justified in using the Embassy’s influence in an attempt to have some of
                            the contracts in question placed in the United States. An expression of
                            the Department’s views on this subject would be of value to me.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 212 of September 11, 11 a.m.,<note n="60" xml:id="d657fn60">Not
                                printed.</note> in which I transmitted a resume of the new
                            regulations concerning foreign exchange operations in this country. I am
                            enclosing a translation of these regulations as issued by the Bank of
                            Brazil, effective September 10, 1934.<note n="60" xml:id="d657fn62">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It is of interest to note that this matter was presented before the
                            Federal Foreign Trade Council at a meeting held on September 10,
                            presided over by the President of Brazil. The draft of the regulations
                            was presented by Dr. Souza Dantas, Exchange Director of the Bank of
                            Brazil and had the approval of the Minister of Finance.</p>
                        <p>It places all products exported, with the exception of coffee, on the
                            free list as far as the buying and selling of foreign exchange is
                            concerned. With respect to coffee, at present world prices,
                            approximately 83% of the value of export bills is retained by the Bank
                            of Brazil and the exporter is allowed freely to negotiate the balance in
                            the open market.</p>
                        <p>With respect to imports the Bank of Brazil will furnish 60% of the
                            exchange required at the official rate and the importer is obliged to
                            procure cover for the other 40% in the open market.</p>
                        <p>As pointed out in previous despatches, this move is in line with the
                            Government’s general policy of gradually breaking away from exchange
                            control with the idea of eventually allowing complete freedom of buying
                            and selling of foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>The immediate reaction following the publication of the regulations in
                            question was the strengthening of the milreis to a very substantial
                            degree in the free market. On September 10, for example, the dollar was
                            quoted at 14$800 whereas on September 12, it was difficult to find
                            buyers at 13$800 to the dollar. It is believed that this sharp reaction
                            is of a temporary nature, and it is thought that the dollar will react
                            just as soon as importers are obliged to seek in the open market the 40%
                            which they formerly received from the Bank of Brazil.</p>
                        <p>It would appear that the present regulations should greatly favor the
                            increased exportation of Brazilian products. However, at the same time
                            it will undoubtedly cause an increase in the cost of imported products
                            and also it is likely to cause a general increase in the cost of
                            living.</p>

                        <p>I wish to call the Department’s attention again to the fact that the
                            President of Brazil presided over the meeting of the Federal Foreign
                            Trade Council which sanctioned the regulations under review. In view of
                            the fact that he has recently shown great interest in all matters
                            pertaining to foreign trade, it is believed that he will take an active
                            part in negotiating the commercial agreement between the United States
                            and Brazil.<note n="61" xml:id="d657fn61">For correspondence regarding

                        <p>132. Your despatch No. 410, August 31, 1934. We are disturbed by this
                            information, which was not furnished Williams by the Brazilian
                            authorities. As you know, Williams was advised by them that Brazil now
                            has no exchange agreements in force except the arrangement with France.
                            We have had in mind a liberal policy in exchange matters towards Brazil,
                            refraining from insisting on a preferential arrangement in order to
                            assist Brazil to work towards a general solution of the problem and
                            ultimate removal of control. The action reported in your 212, September
                            11, 11 a.m.,<note n="62" xml:id="d658fn62">Not printed.</note> was
                            encouraging and in line with Souza Dantas’ policy explained to Williams
                            of increasing the free market by making available there a percentage of
                            the coffee bills.</p>
                        <p>However, the blocking of Brazilian credits by other Governments with
                            Brazil consenting to use such credits only for the purchase of goods
                            from the blocking country, even goods of doubtful necessity such as you
                            describe, would retard Brazil’s program of exchange liberation, would
                            constitute discrimination against us and expose American exporters and
                            creditors of Brazil to further delays in receiving exchange. Obviously
                            under such circumstances it would be increasingly difficult for this
                            Government to pursue the liberal policy in exchange matters with
                            Brazil.</p>
                        <p>Before discussing the exchange situation with Aranha we should appreciate
                            information by cable covering (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) What
                            Governments are now blocking exchange from Brazilian sales and what
                            percentage of such exchange are they blocking? (<hi rend="italic"
                            >b</hi>) Is it expected that on completion of arrangements described in
                            your despatch these particular countries will cease to block Brazilian
                            credits? (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) We would welcome your comment on any
                            phase of this question.</p>

                        <p>238. Department’s 132, September 20, 5 p.m. Information submitted in my
                            despatch 410 of August 31 calls for revision in the light of subsequent
                            developments. First to answer Department’s questions: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>The only countries having blocked Brazilian exchange, and this
                                    in its entirety are Greece, Rumania, Germany, Czechoslovakia,
                                    Yugoslavia, Turkey. I am informed that the aggregate amounts of
                                    blocked exchange approximate $1,200,000.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Not anticipated these countries will cease to block Brazilian
                                    credits on completion of purchases in question for reasons given
                                    in detail below.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In the interest of clarity it should be pointed out that this is not a
                            measure affecting Brazil alone. These countries have as part of their
                            national policy declared to all countries, and not to Brazil alone, that
                            they have much foreign exchange and can buy from other nations only in
                            their own currency. Brazil is there on exactly same footing as other
                            countries as regards blocked exchange.</p>
                        <p>I am definitely assured that Brazil has no exchange arrangements, formal
                            or informal, direct or indirect, with any of these countries; she is
                            simply faced with a situation of fact and has not acquiesced in the
                            arrangement any more than we have acquiesced in the blocking of American
                            money in Brazil. Since she has no other choice Brazil is allowing credit
                            balances to accumulate in the countries mentioned with the hope of
                            liquidating them eventually. This is part of a carefully considered
                            policy, based on the coffee problem. Brazil wishes to retain her markets
                            in the countries which are now blocking exchange, where she has a
                            definite outlet for substantial quantities of coffee. As matters now
                            stand if the coffee is not taken up by those markets the National Coffee
                            Department would be obliged to purchase and burn it, and therefore,
                            quite aside from retaining future markets, it is felt more advantageous
                            to have funds blocked in European banks than “to have coffee ashes in
                            Brazil”.</p>
                        <p>The total of the armaments contracts signed amounts to approximately
                            $6,000,000. With the exception of small amounts, payments will be spread
                            over a period of 42 months. Eighty percent of the contracts is for
                            machine guns from Denmark, a country which has not blocked exchange.
                            Czechoslovakia gets 10 percent, with payment (one-half at sight and
                            one-half in 6 months) from funds already blocked in that country;
                            Germany 3 percent; the United States approximately 1½ percent; and
                            France a smaller amount. (In this connection I am informed that,
                            although these contracts were signed by <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593"
                                facs="0663"/>the Minister of War, objections have been raised and
                            means found to reopen the question of machine guns involving 80 percent
                            of the total, with the result that there are to be tests within the next
                            few weeks in which American firms will compete.)</p>
                        <p>I am given definitely to understand that these purchases were decided
                            upon by the Minister of War without any pressure from the countries
                            where the materials are made.</p>
                        <p>While the Director of Exchange is frankly opposed to purchases of this
                            character because they retard the execution of his plans, he maintains
                            that an expenditure of $6,000,000 spread over nearly 4 years for a
                            country the size of Brazil with run-down military equipment cannot be
                            looked upon as unreasonable. The authorities here recognize the
                            diminishing sales from the United States to Brazil and deplore it, but
                            they point out that it is due to higher prices and shorter terms of
                            credit. England is prepared when necessary to grant 5 years; Germany 4%
                            years (50,000 pounds worth of industrial machinery was purchased by São
                            Paulo company on that basis last month). In this connection Souza Dantas
                            states that if he is successful in securing a revolving credit and
                            clearing arrangement in the United States the problem created by the
                            American method of giving only short-term credit will be solved, and
                            that there will remain only the question of our competing upon a price
                            basis. Souza Dantas contemplates an exchange arrangement with Germany,
                            which will be discussed with the German economic mission which has just
                            arrived from the Argentine. Brazil has taken no initiative in this
                            matter, it being a German proposal. Germany had a favorable trade
                            balance with Brazil of approximately 850,000 pounds last year. Souza
                            Dantas maintains that Brazil can only gain in such an arrangement in
                            that she will sell more coffee to Germany.</p>
                        <p>I venture to point out that Brazil has no exchange agreement with France,
                            as might be inferred from the second sentence of the Department’s
                            telegram. The President of the Bank of Brazil, as reported in my
                            despatch 290 of June 12th<note n="63" xml:id="d659fn63">Not
                                printed.</note> offered in writing to set aside 30 percent of export
                            bills, but inasmuch as France was already getting a larger proportion
                            this proposal has not even been acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>I have ventured to give the foregoing in some detail as you propose to
                            discuss the exchange situation with Aranha. He is better qualified than
                            anybody to discuss the question inasmuch as he was largely instrumental
                            in evolving the present situation. Furthermore, he is still in a
                            position to act more effectively than anyone now in Brazil, either to
                            influence the Minister of War in his purchases or the Minister of
                            Finance in the handling of exchange problems.</p>

                            you can make at this time, presumably after consultation with Souza
                            Dantas, of the amount of (1) American and (2) the total of all deferred
                            credits in Brazil. Also please endeavor to ascertain (1) the sum total
                            of American and all other applications for official exchange which have
                            been approved by the Exchange Control and await allotments of official
                            exchange; (2) an estimate of the amount of pending applications for
                            which approval is expected later to be given; (3) the total amount of
                            official exchange, after deducting that allocated for the various
                            governmental needs, which was allotted during the past full year for
                            private remittance to (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the United States and
                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to all countries. Also please report
                            whether there has been any lessening in the last 6 months of the delay
                            with which official exchange has been made available.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s understanding that, since the establishment of the
                            free market, there are no funds whose transfer is absolutely prohibited
                            and that the greater part of the present accumulation of deferred
                            credits is represented by the backlog of funds awaiting and entitled to
                            conversion at the official rate.</p>
                        <p>Is there also any accumulation of funds, such as interest on direct
                            investments in Brazil, not entitled under the regulations to official
                            exchange, which are held in Brazil for any reason, such as that an
                            attempt to pass them rapidly through the free exchange market would
                            result in too greatly depressing the exchange rate of the milreis?</p>

                        <p>273. Department’s 152, October 9, 7 p.m. Negotiations with German mission
                            are entrusted to committee of three—the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            the Director of the Commercial Section of the Foreign Office, and Souza
                            Dantas.</p>
                        <p>I was informed yesterday by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that
                            Aranha had requested that commitments to Germany be deferred until he
                            had had a further opportunity for discussion in Washington. This morning
                            I took occasion to go into the matter fully with the Acting Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs and Souza Dantas. The Minister informed me that the
                            conversations with the Germans are merely in the nature of exploration
                            and authorizes me to say that no commitment will be made to Germany
                            until agreement is made with the United States.</p>

                        <p>274. My 273, October 10, 4 p.m. … the following information about the
                            conversations with the German mission.</p>
                        <p>This mission first spent 2 months in the Argentine Republic and arrived
                            in Brazil only last week. For the present, the Brazilian authorities are
                            limiting themselves to receiving German suggestions toward facilitating
                            commercial transactions. There is no plan under discussion for the
                            conclusion of a commercial treaty but merely the establishment of a
                            clearing arrangement to facilitate reciprocal payments. The German
                            proposal is, in substance, that exports from <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596"
                                facs="0666"/>Brazil to Germany will be paid for in marks which will
                            be credited to the Bank of Brazil in the Reichsbank. The Bank of Brazil
                            will use these funds in paying for imports from Germany without
                            obligation on either side regarding the movement of these transactions,
                            which will be made exclusively by private initiative of the exporters
                            and importers. The German mission contends that this procedure is
                            necessary and that it is not open to objection in view of the fact that
                            there is normally a close trade balance in business between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the request received from Aranha, the Brazilian
                            authorities will not make any statement or commitment, as they desire
                            first to await the development of Aranha’s conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Government is fully alive to the importance of Brazilian-American
                            commerce and will reach no decision with regard to Germany or any other
                            country which might be prejudicial to Aranha’s negotiations.</p>
                        <p>While there is no immediate intention of concluding a trade agreement
                            with Germany it is considered urgent to dispose of the negotiations with
                            the United States as a necessary preliminary to any further steps on the
                            part of Brazil, as owing to the present difficult situation Brazil must
                            find some way to assure the liquidation of her exports in those
                            countries which are blocking exchange. In conclusion I was told
                            definitely that no commitment would be made until Aranha had had an
                            opportunity to conclude his negotiations in the United States.</p>

                            approximations only in view of the fact that statistics of this nature
                            have never been compiled by the Bank of Brazil.</p>

                                The contrast between these figures is explained by the Bank as
                                indicating that Americans are more nearly up-to-date than other
                                nationalities.</item>

                        <p>There appears to be a lessening in the past 6 months of the delay with
                            which official exchange has been made available, especially in the case
                            of American firms. Since establishment of the free exchange there are no
                            funds whose transfer is absolutely prohibited.</p>
                        <p>Souza Dantas has requested the large buyers of exchange to make
                            remittances slowly in order to avoid depressing the exchange rate of the
                            milreis. The buyers of exchange are complying with Souza Dantas’ request
                            and there has been no exodus of exchange. I have been reliably informed
                            that within the past few months new European capital has been entering
                            Brazil which has also been a factor in strengthening the milreis.</p>
                        <p>I have followed this question day by day since receiving the Department’s
                            142 in an effort to assemble dependable figures. During this time I have
                            received full cooperation from the Bank and am convinced of the
                            soundness of Souza Dantas’ statement that the Bank possesses no
                            dependable statistical information. The foregoing should therefore be
                            regarded as nothing more than a sketchy estimate.</p>

                        <p>298. Department’s 157, October 20, 1 p.m. On inquiry, I am informed that
                            the Consulate General’s air mail despatch referred to is <pb n="598"
                                xml:id="pg_598" facs="0668"/>based on inferences from a statement
                            given to the press by the Federal Foreign Trade Council (enclosure to my
                            despatch No. 447). I am told that the indication of $7,000,000 as the
                            amount involved was arrived at by calculation of the estimated value of
                            500,000 bags of coffee at present prices, but without considering the
                            specific statement that not half of such amount had been shipped.</p>
                        <p>I have gone into this subject today with the Bank of Brazil, have
                            examined the operation of remittances, the negotiations with the German
                            mission, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>The following background may be of interest to the Department. Souza
                            Dantas informed me today that in August the Bank of Brazil began to
                            acquire marks which were being offered by coffee exporters in large
                            lots. The Bank, noticing the increasing volume of these purchases,
                            sought to learn how it was possible to sell coffee to Germany in view of
                            the fact that coffee sales had been on a restricted quota basis during
                            the early part of this year. He learned that Germany had opened a
                            further special quota for coffee in the amount of approximately
                            25,000,000 German marks, which would be blocked and destined to the
                            paymaster [<hi rend="italic">payment?</hi>] of German exports to Brazil.
                            In view of this declaration and in order not to take a dangerous
                            exchange position the Bank of Brazil gradually applied about 20,000,000
                            to German frozen credits, which included collections dating from
                            September 1933, leaving approximately 5,000,000. Cover is being
                            liquidated in the proportion that the Bank of Brazil is receiving
                            exchange resulting from coffee and other transactions. However, the
                            Germans are refusing to apply this in Germany to blocked accounts. In
                            other words, the drafts of the drawees here in Rio are being liquidated
                            but the German drawers are still without cover and will have to wait
                            until: (1) Germany resolves to accept the Bank of Brazil drafts against
                            the blocked credits then [<hi rend="italic">there?</hi>], or (2) until
                            the Bank of Brazil actually receives the 25,000,000 marks. Up to the
                            present time only 1,500,000 marks have been actually paid in Germany
                            against collections, these dating from September 1933. Souza Dantas
                            tells me that far from feeling that they are getting preferential
                            treatment the German mission here is now protesting that the blocked
                            credits in Germany instead of being used to finance current and future
                            business as was intended by them are being applied by the Bank of Brazil
                            exclusively to clearing up backlog dating from September, 1933. They
                            have sought to persuade the Bank of Brazil to modify this course but I
                            am informed that the Bank does not propose to do so under any
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>It has been further made clear to the German mission that even when the
                            backlog is brought up to date the furnishing of exchange for current and
                            future needs will be dependent upon further purchases of coffee.</p>
                        <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0669"/>
                        <p>Souza Dantas’ explanations appear to be confirmed by recent complaints
                            made to me by the German Minister that he had been unable to get for
                            German interests treatment as favorable as that accorded to
                            Americans.</p>
                        <p>This would seem to indicate that no exchange for current needs is now
                            being made automatically available for Germans.</p>

                            exportation of 15 million bags, amounts to approximately 155 million
                            dollars. Forty-five million dollars of that is applied to foreign debt
                            payments. Forty-six percent of the remainder, which would be available
                            to Brazilian importers of American goods, would thus total some 50
                            million dollars. This represents the 60 percent official exchange to
                            which such Brazilian importers are entitled. See Embassy’s 212,
                            September 11, 11 a.m.<note n="66" xml:id="d670fn66">Not

                        <p>Dantas estimates yearly exports from the United States to Brazil at some
                            50 million dollars (which so far as I know, based on Department of
                            Commerce figures for 1932 and 1933 exports, is a most liberal estimate)
                            and 60 percent official exchange to which Brazilian importers of our
                            goods would be entitled on this basis is thus 30 million dollars. There
                            would therefore remain available for backlog 20 million dollars;
                            consequently Dantas’ estimate that the entire American backlog will be
                            automatically liquidated within 1 year would seem justified.</p>
                        <p>This represents a measure so favorable to American interests that it is
                            bound to bring immediate and severe attack from British and other
                            sources. This has already been made evident in the last 24 hours.
                            Brazilian authorities and in particular the Director of Exchange Control
                            will need, and would certainly seem to be deserving of, support to
                            resist the determined attacks which are sure to come. Would Department
                            care to consider giving to the American press statements of
                            gratification or approval of this voluntary Brazilian action and would
                            it also consider formulating the general lines of some statement of
                            similar nature which at the earliest moment possible I could give to the
                            local press? In this latter connection I might state that the local <pb
                                n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0671"/>press are already asking for
                            Embassy comment but in view of the importance as well as the
                            technicality of the matter I should like to have Department’s reaction
                            to this inquiry before speaking in more than general terms to local
                            press representatives.</p>

                        <p>333. I assume my 331, December 5, 4 p.m. which crossed the Department’s
                            179, December 5, 6 p.m., substantially answers the latter. I may add,
                            however, that, as I understand it, it has for a long time been the aim
                            of the Director of Exchange Control and other high Brazilian officials
                            including the Minister of Finance to work towards a distribution of
                            exchange which would not only be more in harmony with the practical
                            equities of Brazil’s foreign trade situation but also with what these
                            same authorities consider Brazil’s proper fundamental policy. There
                            appears to have been a growing realization of the inequity of denoting
                            so much of our dollar exchange to sterling requirements and a
                            determination to put an end to it as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>334. Department’s 180, December 6, 5 p.m. The new regulations are to be
                            regarded as constituting a step in preparation of further relaxation and
                            eventual removal of exchange control in the following sense: In full
                            discussion this morning Souza Dantas stated to me that he expects the
                            effect of these new regulations will be to clear up within a year the
                            backlog of the United States and other countries buying more from Brazil
                            than they sell to her; when this has been accomplished he hopes that
                            greater and eventually complete relaxation of exchange control can be
                            brought about in a comparatively short time for it should then be a
                            relatively easy matter to clean up the backlog of countries who sell to
                            Brazil more than they buy from her.</p>

                            available is less than could reasonably be asked of Government.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Council took up the consideration of the Brazilian Debt Plan
                            immediately upon its organization 2 weeks ago and is prepared to carry
                            through its examination of the Plan with the Government as rapidly as
                            possible. The Council has, however, no specific authority from the
                            bondholders to represent them and no power to accept legal
                            responsibility for changes in carrying out existing contractual
                            obligations. To the extent that such changes are made, the Government
                            must assume the responsibility therefor.</p>
                        <p>(4) Our suggested modifications with reasons therefor and queries on the
                            Plan are given below following order of the Plan itself:</p>
                        <p>(A) Grade I. We recognize the special position of funding loans but
                            believe extraordinary amortization proposal is disproportionately
                            favorable. We suggest that exchange amounting to 600,000 pounds which it
                            was proposed to allocate to this purpose be specifically applied toward
                            increasing service of bonds in Grades below IV.</p>
                        <p>(B) Do you concur necessity proposed payment 150,000,000 French francs
                            before end of 1934 as we understand contemplated. We appreciate special
                            character of this obligation in view of Hague award<note n="71"
                                xml:id="d675fn71">For text of judgment No. 15, July 12, 1929, in the
                                case concerning the payment in gold of the Brazilian Federal loans
                                issued in France, see The Hague, Permanent Court of International
                                Justice, Series A, No. 21, <hi rend="italic">Collection of

                            burden on Government in near future.</p>
                        <p>(C) We recognize special conditions of coffee realization loan 1930 but
                            in view of heavy sacrifices which Plan imposes on other bondholders,
                            suggest possibility of making somewhat less exchange available for
                            sinking fund than now proposed (for example, by retiring say 5 per cent,
                            per annum of original principal amount through market purchases) and
                            specifically applying as in (A) above amount of foreign exchange thus
                            saved which on some such basis should be for next few years somewhere
                            between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 over saving proposed under Plan.</p>
                        <pb n="604" xml:id="pg_604" facs="0674"/>
                        <p>(D) Regarding Grades III and IV what is reason for the uninterrupted
                            allocation of foreign exchange during the past 2 years on the coffee
                            institute loan? We note under table in Plan this loan would receive
                            approximately as much foreign exchange in 1934 as all Grade VI loans
                            combined, though our calculations don’t check with service figure 244
                            given for this loan. Please verify. Institute loan apparently not a
                            commodity secured loan but by taxes like a large number of other secured
                            loans with much lower rating. Also is there any good reason for
                            exceptional position accorded two other São Paulo loans through
                            inclusion in Grade IV?</p>
                        <p>(E) We appreciate reasons for according national Government loans a
                            privileged position although credit standing of national Government
                            formerly no higher than that of certain states and municipalities.
                            However, disparity of treatment between national loans and loans in
                            Grades V and VI is very great, particularly taking into account recent
                            favorable treatment of national loans under funding plan while other
                            loans for the most part were receiving nothing for maturing coupons.
                            Further, we question the fairness of such arbitrary grading of state and
                            municipal bonds as that proposed. As an alternative we suggest that this
                            feature of Plan be modified to give effect to the principle that all
                            provincial and municipal borrowers whose default is due to failure to
                            secure foreign exchange be classified alike and exchange allocated to
                            them pro rata so long as they continue to deposit the full service in
                            milreis. This would make one Grade of V and VI with one schedule of
                            partial payments which schedule in view of foreign exchange reallocation
                            suggested in A and C above should be at least equivalent for combined
                            Grade to schedule now proposed for present Grade V.</p>
                        <p>We believe it unwise for us to attempt any comparison of relative merits
                            of loans in Grades V and VI and consider only fair basis is to treat all
                            such debtors who are willing and able to pay in local currency on the
                            same basis as regards allocation available exchange. If any such debtor
                            fails to make full deposit in milreis, this might constitute a logical
                            basis for allocating less to such debtor but any amount of foreign
                            exchange so saved should be applied under paragraph 6 of Plan as amended
                            pursuant to (G) below.</p>
                        <p>(F) Important to clarify the situation regarding milreis deposits under
                            paragraphs 4 and 5 of Plan. To permit proper functioning of proposal in
                            (E) above desirable that milreis deposits be initially made in some
                            central depositary such as the Bank of Brazil and adequate information
                            regarding such deposits and their eventual investment (to extent not
                            transferred) be made available to respective fiscal agents for loans.
                            Regarding investment of milreis and change suggested paragraph 1 in
                            Ministry’s reply to your memorandum<note n="72" xml:id="d675fn72"
                                >Neither printed.</note> we confirm importance of investment in
                            productive works but believe desirable retain original idea that such
                            investment be pursuant to agreement if it can be decided who together
                            with depositing debtors could appropriately be the parties to such
                            agreement. We fear value of milreis investment for bondholders will be
                            lost in absence of more effective measures of control. We consider this
                            at the same time one of the most important and as drafted one of the
                            weakest and most inadequately defined features of the Plan. It is
                            difficult to send further <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0675"
                            />comments until we hear from you what you consider feasible in this
                            regard after consultation with the Government. In this connection we
                            have inadequate information as to present status of past milreis
                            deposits for provincial and municipal loans and Plan apparently makes no
                            provision regarding such deposits. Please advise on this point.</p>
                        <p>(G) Referring to point 2 of your memorandum and paragraph 6 of Plan, we
                            consider that at least part of the further foreign exchange which may be
                            set apart under Plan, should be applied to pro rata increase schedule of
                            interest payments but we would not object to a part going toward the
                            purchase of bonds in the market on some agreed basis as between amount
                            allocated to current interest and to bond purchases.</p>
                        <p>(H) Proposal to cancel or defer matured coupons against October 1933
                            partial payments seems open to objection particularly in view of fact
                            that there are deposited milreis against such back interest and if such
                            coupons cancelled or deferred result would be to deprive coupon holders
                            of any benefit from such deposits. Suggest possibility of stamping
                            coupons with payments as made without cancelling or deferring unpaid
                            portion either of matured or currently maturing coupons. Proposed
                            outright cancellation would have unfavorable psychological effect
                            although we appreciate that in view of the debt burden the prospect of
                            any early realization on such unpaid portion of such coupons is
                            problematical.</p>
                        <p>Effect of cancelling past coupons would be that many Grade VI bonds would
                            then receive as of October 1933 an amount equal to approximately 2 per
                            cent, of the face amount of five coupons matured since transfers stopped
                            at end of 1931 whereas holders national Government loans are currently
                            receiving for such coupons funding bonds with present market value of
                            approximately fifty, thus giving a disparity of twenty-five to one as
                            between value of payments these two types of loans during period covered
                            by the five coupons. This disparity might be somewhat reduced if past
                            matured coupons not cancelled and eventually a solution might be worked
                            out for some partial satisfaction of these coupons out of milreis
                            deposits already made in many instances against such coupons.</p>
                        <p>(5) Regarding general question of exchange control, we understand that
                            figures regarding available foreign exchange are not divulged thus
                            making it difficult for creditors’ representatives to judge of actual
                            situation and amounts available to service external debt. The Brazilian
                            Government’s initiative in preparing Plan indicates their desire to
                            restore their credit and we feel that this effort might be helpfully
                            supplemented by introducing some central exchange control commission
                            which would make position public. We realize that this may necessitate
                            administrative and possibly legislative changes which would require time
                            but any indication in the Plan of Government’s intention to effect some
                            such arrangement would undoubtedly have very favorable effect.</p>
                        <p>(6) Suggest desirability of inserting in paragraph 7 that future review
                            of debt situation would be carried out in consultation with <pb n="606"
                                xml:id="pg_606" facs="0676"/>representatives of the principal
                            creditor groups concerned. Council would desire to be consulted in the
                            initial stages of any further readjustment of Brazilian debt
                            situation.</p>

                                reached here which had the prior endorsement of the Council and

                                Department would not support as against the Brazilian Government the
                                claim of any bondholders which is based merely on dissatisfaction
                                with such arrangement? Such an assurance from the Department would

                        <p>4. Department assumes you are familiar with cables being interchanged
                            between the Executive Committee of the Foreign Bondholders Protective
                            Council and Reuben Clark.</p>
                        <p>Department is this afternoon transmitting to Clark the Executive
                            Committee’s reply to his long cable to them and in this interchange
                            reference is made to the Department’s possible attitude towards any plan
                            worked out by the Council; but the Executive Committee in its cable to
                            Clark today makes clear that the Department has not yet been consulted
                            in connection with this reference.</p>
                        <p>Department has informed the Executive Committee that except in case of
                            urgent necessity it thinks it wiser that hereafter it communicate with
                            Clark directly rather than through the Embassy. This’ does not mean that
                            the Department in any way disapproves what has or is taking place or
                            that it wishes you to lessen the attention with which you have been
                            following the situation. It seems advisable however in order to adhere
                            to the original purpose of maintaining independence between the Council
                            and the Government.</p>

                        <p>5. From Executive Committee for Clark: <list>
                                <item>“First. Number our long cable through Department 1 and
                                    straight cable number 2.<note n="74" xml:id="d678fn74">Telegram

                                    number 3.</item>
                                <item>Second. Point (2) your cable of 4th. While legal position is
                                    as stated paragraph (3) our number 1, practical situation is
                                    that Brazilian Government would have real element of protection
                                    if it presented a plan which Council could join in describing as
                                    fair and reasonable under circumstances. Presumably there is no
                                    practical legal recourse for bondholders against Brazilian
                                    obligors which are public bodies. Hence what the Government
                                    needs to achieve through plan is not legal protection but
                                    program which will enhance its credit here and obviate friction
                                    with its large group of American bondholders. <pb n="608"
                                        xml:id="pg_608" facs="0678"/>Such friction would be almost
                                    inevitable if attempt made to impose a plan which Council viewed
                                    as discriminatory or inadequate. This should give you a real
                                    basis for negotiation. Further you can indicate orally that if
                                    plan is put through in its present form Council would be forced
                                    to state that this was done on sole responsibility of Brazilian
                                    Government and without Council’s acquiescence.</item>

                        <p>6. Department’s 4, January 8, 6 p.m. Embassy has taken and is taking no
                            part in Clark’s negotiations which in fact have not yet begun owing to
                            unsettled political situation which left no responsible Ministry to deal
                            with. He has not requested Embassy’s assistance except to transmit
                            telegrams for account of Council of Bondholders (he having no codes)
                            which seemed simplest and cheapest way for Embassy to keep the
                            Department fully and currently advised of developments. Clark is keeping
                            Embassy fully informed.</p>
                        <p>Clark is now preparing a telegram embodying his general conception of the
                            problem as it presents itself. I feel it important that Bondholders
                            Committee should have this and as it would obviously be unwise to send
                            it in plain language I propose unless instructed to the contrary to
                            forward it in code tomorrow.</p>

                            January 9, 1934. Your attention is invited to the following: <pb n="609"

                                <item>Present Brazilian Government is nonconstitutional, though
                                    Constituent Assembly now in session here is reported to have
                                    sought to give it some sort of legal status; the Government
                                    maintained itself (according to the general opinion) in 1932,
                                    primarily because the Navy remained loyal, aided by large part
                                    of Army; generally accepted that continued existence of the
                                    Government is dependent upon loyalty of armed forces; the
                                    question of its self-preservation overshadows all other
                                    questions; signs of dissatisfaction in Government ranks
                                    reported; a Cabinet “crisis” has existed for several weeks and
                                    is not yet settled though seemingly nearing settlement; the
                                    Constitutent Assembly, now redrafting the constitution, is
                                    reported as spending much time on extraneous matters and may be
                                    playing for time; every state now has a governor (interventor)
                                    appointed by the Central Government, all governors elected by
                                    the people, except one who died, having been displaced; there
                                    appear to be two opposing factions, one seeking the early
                                    reestablishment of constitutional government, the other favoring
                                    a military dictatorship of some sort. The best informed British
                                    and American observers express their belief that present
                                    political situation is most serious since the revolution and
                                    that anything may happen at any time. Nevertheless situation
                                    probably more stable than foregoing might suggest.</item>

                                    indicated the Government itself owes the bank 600,000 contos; in
                                    addition, large sums have been borrowed by local state
                                    governments from branches of the Bank in various states; by a
                                    decree recently promulgated, the Government has apparently
                                    absolved agriculturists from paying 50 percent of their secured
                                    indebtedness, and is issuing 500,000 contos of bonds with which
                                    to indemnify creditors; according to reports, the Government has
                                    bought considerable munitions, including airplanes; it is
                                    projecting the revamping of the Navy including the scrapping of
                                    old ships and the buying or building of new ones, and plans the
                                    completion of the modern fortification of Bio harbor. Satisfying
                                    Navy aspirations may be a political necessity.</item>

                                    here is not a banking situation with a willing solvent creditor
                                    but a political situation with a necessitous insolvent creditor
                                    that is regarded by some to be a serious if not critical

                                    despoiled, disgruntled bondholders have been endemic in Brazil

                        <p>6. Clark in cable No. 2 of January 4 raised the question of whether the
                            Department would give assurance to the Brazilian Government that in the
                            event any arrangement were reached at Rio which had the prior
                            endorsement of the Council and the approval of the Department, support
                            would be withheld for any claims of bondholders against <pb n="611"
                                xml:id="pg_611" facs="0681"/>the Brazilian Government based merely
                            on dissatisfaction with such arrangements.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday Pierre Jay, a member of the Executive Committee of the Council,
                            consulted the Department regarding this matter. Mr. Jay was told that it
                            seemed in the Department’s judgment rather premature to enter into this
                            phase of the situation now since it was completely hypothetical. It was
                            explained to Mr. Jay that the Department was of course cognizant of the
                            fact that the Council had been brought into existence in response to the
                            initiative of various branches of the Government and that the Department
                            had every intention of cooperating with it within proper limits as
                            situations shape themselves.</p>
                        <p>It seems to the Department that the purpose which Clark had in mind would
                            be served if you, when and as you believed it necessary or advisable,
                            would give to the Brazilian Government assurances that the relations
                            between the Council and this Government were excellent. You might
                            explain the fact that the Council was itself a product of Government
                            initiative and that the Council had undertaken to discuss the Brazilian
                            debt situation with the Brazilian Government with the full knowledge and
                            trust of the Department. In short, you may feel free, without committing
                            the Department as regards any hypothetical situations that might arise,
                            to make it clear to the Brazilian Government that the Council is a
                            responsible agency for protecting the interests of American holders of
                            Brazilian bonds.</p>

                            January 2nd. American issue houses for coffee realization loan have made

                            before final position taken.</p>
                        <p>See our cable 2.<note n="76" xml:id="d682fn76">Telegram No. 2, January 6,

                                not possible suggest that at least further exchange be applicable

                        <p>14. For the Executive Committee of Bondholders Council from Clark:</p>
                        <p>No. 5, January 25, 1934. Replying to the Executive Committee’s No. 6.</p>

                            <item>Paragraph 1, my No. 4. I said I was “assured” of preparation of
                                decree as summarized in my cable; apparently earlier draft decree is
                                now completely redrafted. I will advise of its terms as soon as I
                                definitely learn them. The changes in grading and service appear
                                still to be left as reported in my number 4 though I am not sure
                                about one million-pound extra amortization fund.</item>

                                instructs me to endeavor to secure modified form, I will, of course,
                                follow instructions, but the responsibility is theirs, not
                                mine.</item>

                                    <item>This loan is now disproportionately favored by its
                                        grading; it properly belongs in grade V.</item>

                                        amortization, though at least one dollar loan, the Maranhão,
                                        is at present in a position to be as fully served as the
                                        realization loan.</item>

                                        unduly sterling loans “and franc” or loans in which there
                                        were large sterling interests.</item>

                                        can justify this to American bondholders. But I do not see
                                        how we can justify to great bulk of American bondholders the
                                        preference proposed for this realization loan. In this
                                        connection, someone will ask whether these bonds are widely
                                        distributed or closely held by issuing houses and banks. The
                                        answer will mean much to the bondholding public.</item>

                                It seems to me the Department of State should be willing, we having
                                no code, to assist us by permitting the use of their codes.

                            censorship telegrams of this character in clear language go directly to
                            the Government officials with whom Clark is negotiating, and presumably
                            also into the hands of the British banking representatives who are doing
                            their best to prevent signature of decree.</p>

                            which has been committed but if this sort of instructions continue to
                            arrive in plain language undermining Clark’s position with the Brazilian
                            negotiators, there is little prospect of successful conclusion of

                        <p>My 15, January 25, 6 p.m. Yesterday afternoon final text of decree
                            submitted to President by Finance Minister in Clark’s presence.
                            President gave Clark definite assurances that he would sign decree
                            without alteration today as soon as it could be furnished him in form
                            for signature. Clark has today received from Finance Minister an
                            initialed copy which he is told he may consider official.</p>
                        <p>Full telegraphic report being prepared but in the meantime request
                            Executive Committee be informed.</p>
                        <p>Clark has achieved a remarkable measure of success against strong
                            opposition.</p>

                        <p>24. For information of Department and for transmission to Executive
                            Committee, from Clark:</p>
                        <p>His No. 6. 1. Wednesday afternoon Finance Minister and myself saw
                            President who told me he had read and approved Minister’s whole plan and
                            would sign it as soon as prepared for signature. I have copy of plan
                            initialed by Finance Minister.</p>
                        <p>2. The documents comprising plan are three: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                            formal decree of President putting the plan in operation; (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) an “announcement made by the Federal
                            Government of Brazil”; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) schedules showing
                            assignment of bonds to grades and the exchange assigned to each
                            grade.</p>

                        <p>Documents (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) are
                            those transmitted to the Department with the Embassy’s No. 58, September
                            27, 1933,<note n="82" xml:id="d691fn82"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_76"

                            noted below:</p>
                        <p>3. Referring to my telegram No. 4, January 23, 1 p.m., paragraph 10, and
                            my No. 5, paragraphs 1, 7, and 8, British and French opposition and
                            pressure have been increasingly stiff; the British were represented by
                            Sir Henry Lynch, a lifelong resident of Brazil; Niemeyer himself wired
                            he saw “neither equity nor good sense” in the “various theories advanced
                            by the Americans”. (I hope I have not disgraced the Council); he added
                            “I do not know why Mr. Clark should not get his instructions revised at
                            once”; British reported as expressing frank resentment that Brazilians
                            are dealing with us at all; much apparently made about our being false
                            bankers, not to be relied upon in a pinch as the British are, et cetera.
                            Result is that some modifications have been made in the plan as reported
                            in my No. 4.</p>
                        <p>The following is plan as now approved by the President, the changes noted
                            being alterations in the “announcement” and schedules transmitted with
                            the Embassy’s No. 58, September 27, 1933. (See also my No. 4.)</p>
                        <p>4. First, as to the schedules: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Grade I stands, except as to item of £1,000,000 for
                                    extraordinary service as to which see paragraph 5–(<hi
                                        rend="italic">c</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>)

                                <item>Grade II stands, modified as set forth in my No. 4, paragraph
                                    6;</item>

                                <item>Grade III stands except that Coffee Institute loan has been
                                    taken from grade III and made into a grade V of which it is sole
                                    member with a percentage service for the 4 years respectively of
                                    22[½]—25—[27]—37½. I told the Minister this was still
                                    disproportionately favorable treatment of the Institute loan and
                                    subject to all the objection I had previously made, that I could
                                    not approve it, but that the decision was for him to
                                    make.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Grade IV stands except that both São Paulo loans go to old
                                    grade V now numbered grade VI.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Grade V, new grade for Institute loan; see paragraph (<hi

                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Grade VI (formerly grade V) stands with addition of São Paulo
                                    loans (paragraph (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) above), and of Rio
                                    Grande do Sul 7 percent dollar loan of 1927 up from old grade
                                    VI.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Grade VII (formerly grade VI) stands except that percentage
                                    service has been changed for the 14 to 17½—20—23½—32½. I assume
                                    reduction here from equivalency with former grade V is to
                                    furnish extra exchange for new grade V—Coffee Institute. This
                                    does not fully meet but closely approaches suggestion in your
                                    No. 1, paragraph 4(E), last sentence of first paragraph, is only
                                    2.5 points per year under grade VI, embodying almost double that
                                    originally proposed for old grade VI.</item>

                                <item>Grade VIII, former grade VII, stands except as to issue moved
                                    up as noted in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>)
                                    above.</item>

                        <p>5. Second, as to the “announcement” part of the decree (see document of
                            that title in Embassy’s No. 58). This is substantially same as document
                            of No. 58 except that material has been somewhat rearranged and except
                            as noted below;</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) No mention of Niemeyer.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Service begins April 1934, ends March
                            1938.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Grade II, instead of 5 percent of principal
                            amount, the amortization specified at £1,000,000 per year, for bonds “at
                            or below par or by drawing at par”.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Under headings grade III and IV, the French
                            bonds to be served in gold under Hague Award are named. (I am told
                            negotiations were delayed while they agreed with France on this
                            point.)</p>
                        <p>Third paragraph under this heading—interest payable under funding scheme
                            until October 1934.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) My No. 4, paragraph 7 (<hi rend="italic"

                            paragraph 7(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>); but the foregoing stipulation
                            seems to meet suggestion of your No. 1, paragraph 4(H), last

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) A new paragraph 9 has been added reading as

                                <p>“9. (First paragraph as in Embassy’s No. 58.) The percentages
                                    mentioned in the schedule are percentages of the face value of
                                    the coupons concerned in the currency in which the nominal
                                    amount of the bond is expressed, the option held by certain
                                    bondholders to demand payment in alternative currency at a fixed

                                    coupons and paid in sterling currency.</p>
                                <p>All franc payments will be calculated on the franc face value of
                                    coupons and paid in franc currency, except in the case of those
                                    franc loans specially mentioned under grades III and IV in
                                    paragraph 3 above as being on a gold basis. In the case of these
                                    loans payment, although made in currency francs, will be
                                    calculated on the basis of three currency francs per one franc
                                    nominal as expressed on the coupons.</p>
                                <p>All dollar payments will be calculated on the dollar face value
                                    of the coupons and paid in dollars in accordance with the

                        <p>The Minister states the second paragraph of foregoing (about suspending
                            option) was always part of plan and was suggested by Niemeyer. (This,
                            however, is its first appearance); provisions about francs suggested by
                            French; the sixth paragraph as originally drawn mentioned only dollars,
                            on my objection it was amended to include sterling and francs. To my
                            objection that if the dollar depreciated farther, we would suffer in
                            comparison with sterling, the Minister made and intimated some rather
                            obvious observations.</p>
                        <p>6. Referring to my No. 2, paragraph numbers 2 and 3, President raised
                            question my authority and full powers to deal for bondholders in my
                            first interview with him on January 10, but no other mention of the
                            matter has been made by Brazilians; Niemeyer called attention to
                            situation in his cable referred to in paragraph 3 hereof.</p>
                        <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0692"/>
                        <p>7. In my good-bye interview with the President Wednesday I thanked them
                            for their consideration and fairness, though noting my nonapproval of
                            Coffee Institute position with the resulting effect on new grade
                            VII.</p>
                        <p>8. If Council feels it could express a word of appreciation direct to
                            Minister Aranha it would be most valuable to future relations. The
                            Government has given us what we have in face of great British and French
                            pressure, and in a situation getting more difficult and complex all the
                            time. Incidentally it involved a close personal friendship between the
                            Minister and Lynch.</p>
                        <p>9. Full text of decree and arrangement will be cabled to Brazilian
                            Embassy in Washington, and press men here will be so told after it has
                            gone forward. It would be most helpful to general situation if any
                            favorable news comment about Brazil’s attitude initiating a plan for
                            debt service in these times and in revising in our favor a plan
                            virtually already settled, removing disproportionately favorable
                            treatment and increasing our service, could be sent here by news
                            agencies.</p>
                        <p>10. While the Embassy here has had nothing to do with actual
                            negotiations, yet from the Ambassador down they have been most helpful
                            in giving advice and helping me to keep informed of a shifting political
                            situation. Mr. Albert Browne, the Ambassador’s secretary, has helped me
                            as a secretary and Mr. Xanthaky of the Embassy staff as an interpreter
                            and as news gatherer, for he understands the language perfectly, has
                            unusually numerous contacts in high places, and enjoys the confidence of
                            those who know him.</p>
                        <p>11. As a part of adjustment, the Minister has promised me, and confirmed
                            it Wednesday before the President, that he will furnish Ulen Company
                            with immediate exchange for the full accumulated milreis deposit on his
                            Maranhao loan. My information is that no other loan has now on deposit
                            any milreis for service (see my No. 4, paragraph 5).</p>

                            in the Brazilian Army Center of Instruction. One of these officers
                            should possess special knowledge in the subject of fire tactics and the

                        <p>The Brazilian Ambassador came in this morning to inquire regarding his
                            Government’s request for a military mission of two army officers from
                            this Government to develop Brazil’s Coast Artillery Service.</p>
                        <p>I told the Ambassador that the War Department was agreeable to this
                            request; however, the Department had not yet selected the officers. As
                            soon as it had done so we would take the matter up with the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he had cabled his Government requesting a form
                            of contract to submit to the officers. This was the procedure followed
                            in the case of the naval mission.</p>
