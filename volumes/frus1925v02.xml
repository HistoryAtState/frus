                            you understand that about December 1904 Secretary Hay addressed a

                            U. S. 257, is significant, not only as a judicial decision disposing of
                            the question before the Court, but as expressing the views of Mr.
                            Justice William R. Day who concurred in that opinion. Judge Day, then
                            Secretary of State, signed the protocol of August 12, 1898, embodying
                            the basis for the establishment of peace and he was the head of the
                            United States delegation which signed the Treaty of Peace with Spain on

                            privilege of knowing Judge Day would doubt for a moment that when he
                            concurred in the opinion of the Court, delivered by Chief Justice Fuller
                            in <hi rend="italic">Pearcy</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Stranahan</hi>, he
                            believed that opinion to be a correct statement of the status of the
                            Isle of Pines. You thus have in the opinion of the Supreme Court the
                            deliberate judgment of the distinguished jurist who negotiated the
                            treaty as to what it meant in this particular. You will readily
                            understand how careful Judge Day would have been, in view of his
                            connection with the negotiation of the Treaty, that no error should be
                            made in anything that the Court might say about it.</p>
                        <p>It is in this view that the following paragraph in the opinion is of
                            especial importance, (p. 266): <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In short, all the world knew that it was an integral part of
                                    Cuba, and in view of the language of the joint resolution of
                                    April 20, 1898, it seems clear that the Isle of Pines was not
                                    supposed to be one of the ‘other islands’ ceded by Article II.
                                    Those were islands not constituting an integral part of Cuba,
                                    such as Vieques, Culebra and Mona Islands adjacent to Porto
                                    Rico.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I think, therefore, that the argument that the Isle of Pines was ceded to
                            the United States by the Treaty of Peace is without foundation. The
                            Island belonged to Cuba, and, as the Supreme Court said (p. 272) while
                            the sixth clause of the Piatt Amendment “gave opportunity for an
                            examination of the question of ownership and its settlement through a
                            treaty with Cuba”, Congress “has taken no action to the contrary of
                            Cuba’s title as superior to ours.”</p>
                        <p>The Treaty, as you are doubtless aware, contemplates the relinquishment
                            by the United States in favor of Cuba of all claim of title to the
                            island, thus providing, in the opinion of this and preceding
                            administrations, an equitable solution of a problem of many years’
                            standing. The present undetermined status of the Isle of Pines
                            constitutes one of the few remaining questions capable of prejudicing
                            the intimate relations between the United States and Cuba, and it is my
                            earnest hope that the Senate in its present session will give its
                            consent to the ratification of the Treaty.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>Permit me to emphasize the following points: The failure to ratify the
                            Treaty would not give the Island to the United States. To accomplish
                            that purpose it would be necessary to negotiate another treaty with
                            Cuba, but I am satisfied that Cuba would not consent to relinquish the
                            Island. It would be a waste of money to attempt to buy it and the
                            considerations which appeal to Cuba would, in my judgment, preclude her
                            from putting the matter upon a pecuniary basis. She considers herself
                            entitled to the Island and looks to the United States to perform an act
                            of justice. The failure of the Treaty, then, would simply leave the
                            status of the Island unsettled; it would still remain under Cuban
                            administration; and we should have stirred up ill-feeling. While we
                            cannot obtain the Island for ourselves by refusing to ratify the Treaty,
                            we can by its ratification put an end to an unpleasant question and
                            strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two peoples.</p>

                                which has been or may be made in virtue of Article II of the Treaty

                                reads: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                islets, keys and rocks pertaining to either island. As a historical
                                fact, Spain, at the time of concluding the Treaty of Peace,
                                possessed no territory in the West Indies which was not included in
                                or dependent upon the administrative jurisdiction of the one or the
                                other of the main islands named.</p>
                            <p>Under Spanish rule Cuba and Porto Rico each constituted an

                                included the outlying islands of Culebra and Vieques and all
                                adjacent islets and keys. The Gobierno of Cuba embraced the numerous
                                islands and keys stretching in almost continuous chains along more
                                than one-third of the insular coast, and lying at varying distances
                                therefrom, much as Key West and the Dry Tortugas jut from the <pb

                                Cuba should cease and the future relations of the United States with
                                Cuba should be determined, provided among other terms: <quote

                            <p>To meet the requirements of the Piatt Amendment, a change became
                                necessary in this regard, as well as in some other respects, and,
                                accordingly, the Constitutional Convention of the Republic of Cuba,
                                on June 12, 1901, added an Appendix to the Constitution of Cuba,
                                substantially in the terms of the Piatt Amendment. The Sixth Article
                                of that Appendix reads: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“Article VI. The Island of Pines shall be omitted from the
                                        boundaries of Cuba specified in the Constitution, the title
                                        and ownership thereof being left to future adjustment by
                                        treaty.”</p>
                                </quote></p>
                            <p>The law of the United States and the Constitution of Cuba are thus
                                brought into perfect accord so far as the ownership of the Isle of
                                Pines is concerned. Each party waives claim thereto, subject to the
                                attainment of a mutual conventional understanding. The Congress of
                                the United States has expressly relegated to the treaty making power
                                the duty of adjusting the title to the Isle of Pines. The Cuban
                                Constitutional Convention, having by Article II of the Constitution
                                declared all the adjacent islands and keys to, be part of the
                                territory of the Republic, subsequently amended the Constitution by
                                specifically omitting the Isle of Pines from that enumeration and
                                leaving the ownership thereof to be adjusted by treaty.</p>
                            <p>A peculiar situation thus confronted the treaty making power of the
                                two countries. Neither claimed the sovereignty of the Isle of <pb
                                    n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0088"/>Pines. The Act of March 2,
                                1901, estopped the United States from an <hi rend="italic">ex
                                    parte</hi> assertion of ownership under the provisions of
                                Article II of the Treaty of Peace, by requiring the agreement of
                                Cuba thereto. The Cuban Constitution waived, with similar condition,
                                such an assertion on the part of the Republic. The supreme law of
                                each nation made it mandatory upon its executive to seek a
                                conventional adjustment of the matter with the other, in accordance
                                with the facts and the equities of the case. Neither party was in a
                                position, as self-declared and recognized master of the territory in
                                question, to cede or grant it to the other. No such extreme
                                condition interposed to tax the national sentiment of either. All
                                that became incumbent upon the two governments was to agree whether,
                                under the terms of Article I of the Treaty of Peace between the
                                United States and Spain, the Isle of Pines was territorially
                                embraced in the generic denomination of “Cuba” and as such came
                                within the Spanish relinquishment of sovereignty and title thereto;
                                or whether, finding that the Isle of Pines was not a part of the
                                Cuban domain, under Spanish rule, it fell within the alternative
                                enumeration of “other islands” than Cuba and Porto Rico then under
                                Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies, and, as such, was ceded to
                                the United States by Article II of the Treaty of Peace.</p>
                            <p>Thus presented, the question before the negotiators was simplified.
                                There was no possible doubt as to the antecedent status of the Isle
                                of Pines. Its past and present history made it difficult to be
                                differentiated from the “Cuba” of Article I of the Treaty of Peace
                                and to be constructively regarded as one of the “other islands”
                                embraced in the intendment of Article II. For centuries it had been
                                an integral part of the gubernative domain of Cuba. Politically and
                                judicially it pertained to the municipal jurisdiction of Habana,
                                being an ayun-tamiento or municipal district of the judicial
                                district of Becujal, in the Province of Habana. Its inhabitants
                                voted for municipal officers as citizens of Habana. They cast their
                                votes in like manner for Deputies to the national Cortes at Madrid.
                                They were identified with the people of Cuba, and this merger of
                                their franchises and interests continued under the military
                                occupation of Cuba by the United States, but with some enlarged and
                                purely local municipal privileges. Under the general orders of the
                                United States military governor, they voted in the general election
                                for a delegate to the Constituent Assembly, casting their votes as
                                belonging to the Third Circuit of the Province of Habana, and thus
                                shared in framing and adopting the Constitution of the Republic of
                                Cuba. They subsequently voted in the same manner for Presidential
                                electors. In short, the weightier considerations led to the
                                conclusion that (as well phrased in the preamble to the Resolution
                                submitted in the House of Representatives on December <pb n="7"
                                    xml:id="pg_7" facs="0089"/>8, 1903) “by the terms of the treaty
                                of Paris the Kingdom of Spain relinquished sovereignty over the Isle
                                of Pines as part of the Island of Cuba”, and that in virtue of such
                                relinquishment, as distinguished from the cession of other islands
                                in the West Indies, the Isle of Pines was to be deemed an integral
                                part of the territory over which, in pursuance of the Resolution of
                                Congress of April 20, 1898, the relinquishment of Spain’s authority
                                and Government had been demanded, and which territory, in obedience
                                to the same mandate of law, the United States in due time ceased to
                                occupy and turned over to the people of Cuba. By like mandate of
                                law, it became the duty of the treaty making power to declare this
                                conclusion and give it effect by a treaty which should adjust the
                                title to the Isle of Pines.</p>
                            <p>A treaty was accordingly negotiated under and within the statutory

                                    1903. Injunction of secrecy was removed on Nov. 24, 1903. The
                                    treaty lapsed, as it carried a provision (article IV) that

                                    of signature and no final action was taken on it by the Senate
                                    within that period. A similar treaty not carrying any time limit
                                    was signed in Washington on Mar. 2, 1904 (<hi rend="italic"

                                    to the Senate on Mar. 3, 1904. The other articles of the two
                                    treaties are the same except that in article I of the treaty
                                    signed on Mar. 2, 1904, the clause “which has been or may be

                                public, it is proper to the purposes of this report to say that its
                                terms do not stipulate for “granting and ceding the Isle of Pines to

                                the House of Representatives. It simply relinquishes in favor of the

                                of Peace with Spain, and that the island has been uniformly governed
                                by the Republic of Cuba since that Republic came into existence, the
                                United States recognizing Cuba as rightfully exercising <hi
                                    rend="italic">de facto</hi> sovereignty until otherwise provided
                                for.</p>
                            <p>In the case of <hi rend="italic">Pearcy</hi> versus <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Stranahan</hi>, before mentioned, the court considered that it
                                was justified in assuming that the Isle of Pines had always been
                                treated by the representatives in Cuba of the President <pb n="9"
                                    xml:id="pg_9" facs="0091"/>of the United States as an integral
                                part of Cuba. The court added that this was “no doubt to be expected
                                in view of the fact that it was such at the time of the execution of
                                the treaty and its ratification, and that the treaty did not provide
                                otherwise in terms”, to say nothing of the general principles of
                                international law before mentioned.</p>
                            <p>The executive branch of the Government has apparently, as indicated
                                by the treaty it concluded with Cuba March 2, 1904, and its other
                                dealings with this subject above referred to, taken the ground that
                                under the Treaty of Peace with Spain the Isle of Pines was not one
                                of the “other islands now under Spanish sovereignty in the West
                                Indies” and ceded to the United States by the treaty, but was an
                                integral part of Cuba over which Spain relinquished claim to
                                sovereignty by the treaty. In any event, the United States has
                                undoubtedly indicated that it did not desire to assert any title to
                                the Island under the Treaty of Peace with Spain, but wished to
                                quit-claim in favor of Cuba any shadow of title it might have under
                                that treaty.</p>
                            <p>It cannot be doubted that in adopting this attitude the Government of
                                the United States was influenced by the proximity of the Island to
                                Cuba and the consequently applicable principles of international
                                law, and by the fact that the Isle of Pines had uniformly been
                                administered as an integral part of Cuba.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary of State considers it desirable in the interest of
                                relations between the United States and Cuba that the treaty before
                                the Senate should be approved. The ratification of the treaty would
                                leave the situation with respect to Cuban exercise of authority over
                                the island as it is at the present time. Possible causes of friction
                                between the two Governments would be obviated and the uncertainty in
                                the minds of the inhabitants of the island as to its status would be
                                removed.</p>
                            <p>It is true that a certain amount of opposition to the ratification of
                                this treaty exists in the minds of persons who fear that their
                                interests in the island will be imperiled in the event that this
                                Government definitely renounced all claim of title to the Isle of
                                Pines. The opponents of the treaty contend that American citizens
                                were encouraged to purchase land in the island and to settle there
                                by statements of the United States Government officials, either
                                verbal or in writing, to the effect that the Isle of Pines was
                                United States territory. The opponents of the treaty, furthermore,
                                assert that as a consequence of such assurances large numbers of
                                American citizens acquired property in the island and have made
                                their homes there, believing that they would reside under the
                                jurisdiction of the United States, and they therefore contend that
                                the act of the Government in permitting Cuba to exercise control
                                over the island, and its intention, as expressed in the treaty, to
                                renounce any claim which it may have of <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10"
                                    facs="0092"/>title thereto, constitute a breach of good faith
                                and a betrayal of the interests of those American citizens who
                                reside or possess property in the island. There is no foundation for
                                this contention.</p>
                            <p>The written statements attributed to Government officials affirming
                                the sovereignty of the United States over the Island consist, so far
                                as I am aware, entirely of letters written in 1899 and 1900, in
                                answer to inquiries on the subject, by the then Assistant Secretary
                                of War, Mr. G. D. Meiklejohn, or by his direction. It should be
                                observed in this connection that Mr. Meiklejohn had no authority to
                                speak for the Government of the United States in the matter or to
                                bind the Government of the United States by anything he saw fit to
                                say on the subject. (Page 16, Senate Document No. 205, 59th
                                Congress, 1st Session, entitled “Adjustment of Title to the Isle of
                                Pines”). The oral statements said to have been made by United States
                                government officials are not of record and cannot therefore be
                                considered as evidence.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, attention is called to the fact that the Isle of
                                Pines was particularly and definitely regarded and treated as a
                                municipality of the Province of Habana by the United States when it
                                took the census of Cuba under order of President McKinley, dated
                                August 17, 1899. The report of that census states in part: “The
                                Government of Cuba has jurisdiction not only over the island of that
                                name, but also over the Isle of Pines lying directly south of it …”,
                                and further, “The total population of Cuba, including the Isle of
                                Pines and neighboring keys was, on October 16, 1899, 1,572,797.” As
                                stated by Senator Foraker on page 6 of his report contained in
                                Senate Document No. 205, <hi rend="italic">supra:</hi></p>

                                <p>“Attention is particularly called to the fact that this census,
                                    taken subsequent to August, 1899, shows that at the time when it
                                    was taken there were in the Isle of Pines only 14 persons who
                                    were natives of any other country than Cuba or Spain.
                                    Practically all of the protestants must, therefore, have gone to
                                    the Isle of Pines subsequent to the taking of that census, and
                                    therefore with full knowledge that the Isle of Pines was being

                                    Cuba and as a part thereof. If the 14 persons citizens of other
                                    countries than Spain and Cuba were citizens of the United
                                    States, they should have taken notice of the fact that they were
                                    enumerated as foreigners, which of itself indicated that the
                                    Isle of Pines was not domestic territory of the United

                            twenty-one [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Republics participating in said
                            conference, or as to the action taken on the memorandum above referred
                            to.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully request that the Embassy be furnished English copies (not
                            procurable here) of said Treaty and memorandum and, likewise,
                            information as to whether the Department deems it opportune at this
                            moment to enter upon negotiations with the Cuban Government of the
                            character referred to. I was a member of the Fourth Pan-American
                            Conference in 1910 and of the Committee thereof which dealt with
                            consular administration of the several countries. I recall the wide
                            diversity as to consular requirements respecting shipments which the
                            study of the Committee revealed and likewise the urgent necessity which,
                            in the minds of the Committee, existed for a Treaty which would
                            introduce greater uniformity in this regard.</p>

                            the treaty between the United States and Canada, signed on January 8,

                            Government.</p>
                        <p>A copy of a despatch dated December 13, 1924, received from the American
                            Consul General at Habana, setting forth the extent to which Cuban ports
                            are used in smuggling intoxicating liquors into the United States, is
                                enclosed.<note n="7a" xml:id="d9fn7a">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>According to information received from other sources it seems that
                            smuggling operations are carried on extensively from Cuba, not only with
                            respect to intoxicating liquors but with respect to narcotics, aliens
                            and goods subject to the payment of customs charges in the United
                            States. It is believed that it would be of assistance to the officers of
                            the United States engaged in enforcing the laws with regard to
                            prohibition, narcotic drugs, immigration and the collection of customs
                            dues if a Convention could be concluded with Cuba similar to that signed
                            by representatives of the United States and Canada on June 6, 1924.
                            There would seem to be no reason for including in such a convention
                            provisions similar to Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention with Canada
                            signed on June 6, 1924. Changes of phraseology would also be necessary
                            in the other articles, as there is no “international boundary” between
                            the two countries. Amendments to Article 4 to include the exchange of
                            information concerning the names and activities of persons known or
                            suspected to be engaged in violation of the customs, liquor and
                            immigration laws of the United States or of Cuba would be desirable.</p>
                        <p>As it also appears that there is no extradition treaty with Cuba covering
                            crimes and offenses against the laws for the suppression of traffic in
                            narcotics, it is suggested that it would be desirable to endeavor to
                            negotiate an extradition treaty with Cuba covering this subject. Two
                            copies of the Extradition Treaty concluded between the United States and
                            Cuba on April 6, 1904 are enclosed.<note n="8" xml:id="d9fn8"><ref

                        <p>You are instructed to bring this matter to the attention of the Cuban

                            disposed to conclude similar conventions with the United States. It is
                            earnestly hoped that Cuba will favorably consider the matter and you
                            will telegraph the Department as soon as you receive a reply.</p>
                        <p>On account of the extent to which it appears that smuggling operations
                            are now being carried on from Cuba, you will suggest to the Cuban
                            authorities that they consider whether greater surveillance can be

                            between the United States and Cuba. On page 3 of that instruction
                            reference was made to the Convention for the prevention of the smuggling
                            of intoxicating liquors, concluded between the United States and Great
                            Britain on January 23, 1924, and you were instructed to propose to the

                            Panama, signed on June 6, 1924, be used.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 422 [<hi rend="italic">442</hi>] of March
                            11, 1925, transmitting certain articles, dealing with consular rights,
                            from a convention signed by representatives of the United States and
                            Germany on December 8, 1923.</p>
                        <p>It will be recalled that in the Department’s instruction No. 458 of April
                            9, 1925,<note n="23" xml:id="d14fn23">Not printed.</note> the Embassy
                            was authorized to defer the proposed treaty negotiations with Cuba until
                            after the administration of General Machado had been established.
                            Inasmuch, however, as it was the intention of this administration to
                            retain Dr. Carlos Manuel de Céspedes as Secretary of State, I
                            transmitted to him on May 5, 1925, drafts of the proposed treaties,
                            among them the Consular Convention, in order that he might have an
                            opportunity to study them in advance of the actual negotiations, which
                            were to be taken up as soon as possible after the inauguration of the
                            President on May 20, 1925. A copy of the suggested draft of the consular
                            convention which was sent to Secretary Céspedes with my note of May 5,
                            1925, is to be found as Exhibit No. 2 of Enclosure No. 1<note n="23"
                                xml:id="d14fn25">Not printed.</note> to this despatch.</p>
                        <p>The installation of the new administration naturally made delay in the
                            consideration of current business inevitable, and the subsequent illness
                            of Secretary Céspedes again deferred the negotiations. Finally, however,
                            under date of August 22 [<hi rend="italic">12?</hi>], 1925, I received a
                            communication from Dr. Céspedes, a copy of which is transmitted herewith
                            as enclosure No. 1,<note n="23" xml:id="d14fn26">Not printed.</note>
                            which submitted certain comments on the draft convention submitted by
                            the Embassy and enclosed a counter-draft for the consideration of the
                            American Government.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>Informal discussions concerning the character of the changes proposed by
                            the Cuban Government and the reasons therefor have been held with both
                            Dr. Céspedes and Dr. Gutiérrez, the legal adviser of the Cuban
                            Department of State. It appears that the Cuban Government is animated by
                            certain very natural wishes in connection with the negotiation of the
                            new treaties, and these wishes were frankly explained. In the first
                            place, the Cuban Government feels that the Spanish texts of the treaties
                            now in force between the United States and Cuba are obviously merely
                            translations of the English texts and that the impression therefore
                            conveyed to any one who studies these treaties is that the texts thereof
                            were dictated by the United States and then literally translated into
                            Spanish. Both Dr. Céspedes and Dr. Gutiérrez expressed the earnest
                            desire that the texts of the new treaties being negotiated, and
                            particularly that of the Consular Treaty, should be expressed in
                            idiomatic Spanish as well as idiomatic English and that due regard
                            should be had for Spanish phraseology.</p>
                        <p>A second point which was raised in connection with the Consular Treaty
                            was the desire of the Cuban Government to make this convention a model
                            convention—one which could be used as a basis not only for future
                            treaties between Cuba and other foreign countries but also as a model
                            for Latin-America in general.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Céspedes, during the course of our conversations, referred several
                            times to Article II of Project No. 23 concerning consuls as prepared by
                            the American Institute of International Law at the request of the Board
                            of Directors of the Pan American Union. It appears that on March 6,
                            1925, the Board resolved to send this project to the Governments members
                            of the Union<note n="24" xml:id="d14fn24">The resolutions were approved
                                by the Governing Board on March 2; March 6 was the date of the
                                letter of certification by the Secretary of the Governing Board; see
                                    <hi rend="italic">Codification of American International
                                    Law</hi> (Washington, Pan American Union, 1925) p. 4.</note> in
                            order that their comments might be submitted to the Commission of
                            Jurists which will meet at Rio de Janeiro on August 2, 1926.</p>
                        <p>It is the frankly expressed desire of the Cuban Government to conclude
                            the negotiation, signature and ratification of the Consular Treaty with
                            the United States prior to that date in order that Cuba may be able to
                            present to the conference at Rio de Janeiro a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                accompli</hi> in the line of model consular conventions.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that the Department may be willing to concur in certain of
                            the changes suggested by the Cuban Government as being more applicable
                            to Latin-American countries whose penal codes are based on Spanish
                            models and whose jurisprudence follows Latin rather than Anglo-Saxon
                            practices.</p>

                        <p>I have the honor to refer to my telegram No. 105 of August 28, 12
                                M.,<note n="25" xml:id="d15fn30">Not printed.</note> setting forth
                            the Cuban desire to omit the word “offenses” and to confine the
                            supplementary treaty to “crimes” (<hi rend="italic">delitos</hi>) so as
                            to emphasize the fact that misdemeanors (<hi rend="italic">faltos</hi>)
                            are excluded not only from the supplementary treaty, but from the
                            original treaty. In its telegram No. 100 of September 3, 4 P.M.,<note
                                n="25" xml:id="d15fn31">Not printed.</note> the Department informed
                            me that it had no objection to the omission from the proposed
                            supplementary extradition treaty of the words “and offenses”, stating
                            that, however, this omission, if made, could not be considered as
                            altering obligations incurred by the existing extradition treaty. Acting
                            on these instructions I sent a note to the Foreign Office on September
                            4, 1925, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d15fn32">Not printed.</note> There are enclosed herewith

                            the Cuban Government in the statements made in my note.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the first sentence of the last paragraph of the second
                            page of the Department’s instruction No. 532 of September 2, 1925, I beg
                            to state that I brought to the attention of the Cuban Government the
                            desire of the American Government to include in <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0107"/>the supplementary treaty violations of
                            the customs laws of both countries. I enclose herewith copy and
                            translation of a note dated September 10, 1925, from Doctor
                                Céspedes<note n="26" xml:id="d15fn26">Not printed.</note> expressing
                            the consent of the Cuban Government to comply with the Department’s
                            suggestion, but proposing certain changes in phraseology.</p>
                        <p>In considering, therefore, the text of the Cuban counter-draft (Enclosure
                            No. 1)<note n="26" xml:id="d15fn34">Not printed.</note> there should be
                            borne in mind the willingness of the Cuban Government to add, presumably
                            as Paragraph No. 23 of Article II, the following provision: <quote

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            No. 1176 of September 11, 1925, containing a report regarding the
                            present status of the negotiations respecting the proposed extradition
                            convention between the United States and Cuba. You forwarded a
                            counter-draft of the convention submitted by the Cuban Foreign Office,
                            together with copy and translation of the Foreign Office note respecting
                            the provisions of such counter-draft, including the proposition to cover
                            certain additional crimes in the proposed convention, and you state that
                            in view of a subsequent note from the Foreign Office it should be
                            considered in examining the text of the Cuban counter-draft that the
                            Cuban Government is willing to add, presumably as paragraph No. 23 of
                            Article II, the following provision: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Infractions of the customs laws or ordinances which may
                                    constitute crimes.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is noted that the Foreign Office desires to designate the proposed
                            convention as an additional protocol to the present extradition treaty,
                            rather than as a supplementary convention as proposed by this
                            Government. With respect to this point it may be observed that as the
                            word “protocol” is used in this country, and generally so far as the
                            Department is informed, it signifies an agreement between two foreign
                            offices, whereas the proposed convention will necessarily, under the
                            system of Government prevailing in the United States, <pb n="26"
                                xml:id="pg_26" facs="0108"/>be submitted to the Senate for its
                            advice and consent, and dealt with in all respects like other treaty
                            agreements made by this Government. Therefore the Department is clearly
                            of the opinion that it would be more fitting to refer to the proposed
                            convention as a supplementary extradition convention rather than as a
                            protocol.</p>
                        <p>With relation to the proposed additional crimes to be included in the
                            convention, and taking them in, the order in which they are mentioned in
                            the Cuban counter-draft, it may be observed that the crime of dishonest
                            or immoral abuses is not known as such in the jurisprudence of the
                            United States, and the term is so lacking in definitiveness that the
                            Department would be reluctant to include it among the list of
                            extraditable crimes.</p>
                        <p>It may further be said that the Department would have no objection to
                            including among extraditable crimes abortion and seduction of minors.
                            However, the term “corruption of minors” does not connote as such, an
                            offense known to the jurisprudence of the United States, and the
                            Department would prefer not to include an extraditable crime so broadly
                            and indefinitely termed.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban Foreign Office proposes to include the crime of “embezzlement,
                            this being understood to be the defraudation made by one person against
                            another by means of deceit.” While pointing out that embezzlement by
                            public officers or depositaries and embezzlement by persons hired or
                            salaried to the detriment of their employers are included among the
                            extraditable crimes covered by the existing extradition treaty between
                            the United States and Cuba, the Department may say that the crime quoted
                            as contained in the Cuban proposal would seem to be covered by the
                            following crime covered in paragraph No. 6 of Article II of the present
                            treaty: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Obtaining money, valuable securities or other personal property
                                    by false devices.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The following crime is also proposed by the Foreign Office for inclusion
                            in the convention: “Commercial frauds and crimes committed as the result
                            of suspensions of payments or bankruptcy.” The Department is of the
                            opinion that this proposal is not sufficiently definite and certain and
                            would prefer that it be amended to read as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Crimes against bankruptcy law, if made criminal by the laws of
                                    both countries.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Department is, of course, in accord with the proposal to include in
                            the convention “crimes against the laws for the suppression of the
                            traffic in narcotic products”. Furthermore, the Department is willing to
                            accept the Cuban proposal for the wording above quoted of the
                            extraditable crime involving violations of the customs laws and
                            regulations.</p>
                        <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0109"/>
                        <p>You will please bring the foregoing promptly to the attention of the
                            Foreign Office and endeavor to conclude a convention in accordance with
                            the desires of the Department as above expressed.</p>

                        <p>It was readily apparent to me after studying Dr. Céspedes’ note that the
                            negotiation of the treaty was being unduly delayed because of the

                            interview, and on the morning of October 15th I had a long discussion
                            with Dr. Céspedes and Dr. Gutierrez, his legal adviser, after which I
                            sent the Department my telegram No. 123 of October 15, 3 P.M.<note

                        <p>Dr. Céspedes finally expressed the belief that the present extradition
                            treaty covers under fair construction the offense sought to be <pb
                                n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0110"/>made extraditable by said
                            paragraph. I therefore request that the Department disregard so much of
                            the previous correspondence as refers to that point, and of course the
                            references thereto in Dr. Céspedes’ note No. 1027 of October 7, 1925,
                            which forms enclosure No. 2 of this despatch.</p>
                        <p>In considering this question Dr. Céspedes stated he felt it might be
                            necessary for him to submit a note to the Embassy with reference to the
                            Protocol Amending the Spanish Text of the Extradition Treaty of April 6,
                                1904,<note n="28" xml:id="d17fn28"><ref target="frus1905#pg_280"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1905, p.
                                280</ref>.</note> in order that there might be no possibility of any
                            doubt arising in Cuba of the inclusion of “estafa” as an extraditable
                            offense. “Estafa” is a broader term than our words “embezzlement” or
                            “larceny” and broader also than the phrase “obtaining money, etc. under
                            false pretenses”, and he expressed his agreement that it would be
                            difficult to find an exact English equivalent for the qualified <hi
                                rend="italic">estafa</hi> which he wished to make an extraditable
                            offense. He further said that he was: of the opinion that the crime of
                            qualified <hi rend="italic">estafa</hi> could be made to appear as
                            extraditable by changing the punctuation of paragraph 6 of Article II of
                            the Protocol, where he apparently felt that the first two commas should
                            be semicolons, as they are in the English text of the original treaty,
                            and perhaps by changing other obscurities of the Spanish text arising
                            out of improper punctuation.</p>
                        <p>I transmit herewith, as enclosure No. 3, a draft of the proposed
                            Additional Extradition Treaty<note n="29" xml:id="d17fn29">Not
                                printed.</note> in a form which according to the oral understanding
                            arrived at with Dr. Céspedes is agreeable to his Government and which
                            appears to me to be closely in accord with the views expressed by the
                            Department. I should be pleased to receive the Department’s comment on
                            this draft.</p>

                            No. 1220 of October 30, 1925,<note n="29" xml:id="d18fn29">Not

                            draft entitled “Convention between the Republic of Cuba and the United
                            States of America for the Suppression of Smuggling”.</p>
                        <p>In order that the Department may be in a position to compare this draft
                            with the two previous American drafts, which it combines into a single
                            counter proposal, there is transmitted herewith a comparison in parallel
                            columns of the corresponding articles of these drafts.<note n="29"
                                xml:id="d18fn34">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0111"/>
                        <p>The Department will observe that in general the tendency of the Cuban
                            Government has been to amplify and to attempt to render more specific
                            certain of the articles in question. In general I think that the Cuban
                            Government has shown a sincere spirit of good-will in the negotiations,
                            but I am not certain that all of their proposals will be entirely
                            suitable to conditions prevailing in the United States. It should be
                            observed that the first twelve articles of the Cuban draft convention
                            have provisions corresponding to all of the provisions of the American
                            draft entitled “Convention between the United States and Cuba to
                            Suppress Smuggling Operations Between Their Respective Territories”,
                            with the exception of the provisions in Article V of the American draft
                            to the effect that the High Contracting Parties would agree to refuse
                            admission to aliens seeking entry into their territory when there was
                            reason to suspect that such aliens were endeavoring to enter said
                            territory for the purpose of subsequently effecting unlawful entry into
                            the territory of the other High Contracting Party.</p>
                        <p>Articles XIII to XX, inclusive, of the Cuban counter draft correspond to
                            the articles of the American draft entitled “Convention for the
                            Prevention of Smuggling of Intoxicating Liquors into the United States”.
                            Here it will be noted that Article XIV of the Cuban counter draft
                            departs substantially from the American draft in that it makes the right
                            of search of vessels, et cetera, a reciprocal privilege instead of
                            confining the same to a unilateral declaration on the part of Cuba as
                            was suggested in the American draft, which in turn was based on the
                            convention between the United States and Great Britain on this subject,
                            signed at Washington on January 23, 1924. It should further be noted
                            that Article XV of the Cuban counter draft provides for the submission
                            of a report of the boarding or search of a vessel to the diplomatic and
                            consular representatives of the nation under the flag of which the ship
                            sails. Article XVIII of the Cuban counter draft, it will be noted,
                            substitutes the Permanent Court of International Justice of The Hague,
                            in the event that the United States should adhere to the protocol of
                            December 16, 1920,<note n="30" xml:id="d18fn30"><ref

                            October 24, 1925,<note n="31" xml:id="d18fn31">Not printed.</note> and I
                            shall await with interest the Department’s comments on the Cuban counter
                            proposals. I venture to express the hope that I may receive instructions
                            on this subject at as early a date as possible, in order that I may be
                            able to complete the negotiations so that the treaty will be ready to
                            submit to the Senate of the United <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0112"

                        <p>The Department will observe that the text of the English translation used
                            in the parallel column statement enclosed herewith is slightly different
                            from that transmitted with my despatch No. 1220 of October 30. These
                            slight changes have been made with a view to rendering the translation

                            honor to report that on September 30, 1922, Mr. Magruder, then Chargé
                            d’Affaires, submitted a draft of the proposed treaty to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs; that on October 26th Dr. Emil Spira, a chief of Section
                            in the Ministry of Justice, called at the Legation and discussed the
                            possibility of certain <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0115"/>minor
                            modifications in the treaty; that he pursued this discussion in greater
                            detail in January of this year first with Mr. Pearson, Secretary of
                            Legation, and then with the Minister; that as there still remained some
                            slight differences between the draft submitted by the Legation and the
                            conditions which this Government, according to Dr. Spira, would be
                            prepared to accept, the Minister requested the latter to submit counter
                            propositions thereon. These counter propositions have not yet been
                            received, and the Legation has now requested the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs to state whether or not the draft in question meets with his

                        <p>21. Recently a representative of Dillon, Read and Company called to
                            advise the Department of State informally that certain tentative
                            discussions had been taking place in Prague between a representative of
                            the company and the Government of Czechoslovakia in regard to a possible
                            loan of $60,000,000; of this amount one-half would be for general
                            construction purposes, and the other half would go in part for the
                            establishment of a bank of issue and in part to stabilize the
                            currency.</p>
                        <p>Department was informed (1) that these conversations had arrived at stage
                            where matter had either to be continued seriously or to be discontinued;
                            and (2) that the bankers felt that the market could now take $30,000,000
                            for Czechoslovakia but not $60,000,000. The bankers were inquiring in
                            regard to the Department’s attitude toward such a loan as they had in
                            mind, and they were informed that until the Czechoslovak Government
                            should reply to this Government’s recent note regarding refunding of
                            Czechoslovakia’s debt to the United States,<note n="4" xml:id="d25fn4"

                            be disposed to view favorably any financing in the American market on
                            behalf of that Government.</p>
                        <p>The bankers were also informed that the Department would have no
                            objections to communication of above views to Government of
                            Czechoslovakia.</p>

                        <p>30. Refer Department’s No. 21, June 9, 7 p.m. Department has been
                            informed by bankers that their representatives in Prague indicated to
                            President Masaryk and to Foreign Minister Beneš that until a reply
                            should be received from the Czechoslovak Government to this Government’s
                            recent note regarding refunding of indebtedness of Czechoslovakia to the
                            United States, the Department would not be disposed to view with favor a
                            loan to Czechoslovakia, and that for the purpose of cooperating with the
                            Department, the bankers suspended negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Department is now informed by bankers that Czechoslovak authorities have
                            in meantime requested National City Company to make an offer on loan in
                            question and they fear that agreement will be reached between National
                            City Company and Czechoslovak Government, conditioned on favorable
                            action by Department, whereby they will be excluded from business which
                            they initiated.</p>
                        <p>Department does not desire, of course, to favor one firm of American
                            bankers over another, but at same time Department feels that it would be
                            hardly fair to Dillon, Read and Company if their position should be
                            prejudiced by reason of their cooperation with Department. You are
                            instructed, therefore, to make discreet inquiry, and if as result of
                            your inquiries you find that the National City Company or any other
                            American banker is negotiating a loan with Czechoslovak Government, you
                            will request the representative of that banking firm to call upon you at
                            the Legation, and you will inform him (1) that until a satisfactory
                            reply is received from the Czechoslovak Government to the Department’s
                            note regarding refunding of Czechoslovakia’s indebtedness to the United
                            States, the Department cannot view with favor flotation of a
                            Czechoslovak loan in this country; and (2) that Department would
                            strongly disapprove conclusion of any loan agreement or option between a
                            foreign borrower and American banker specifically conditioned upon
                            Department’s favorable action respecting it. Department desires to be
                            consulted before any agreement with prospective foreign borrower is
                            concluded; it is not willing that preliminary contracts be signed
                            conditioning final <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0123"/>loan contract
                            upon Department’s offering no objection to proposed transaction.</p>

                        <p>34. Your No. 43, July 25, 1 p.m. On July 25 the Department inquired
                            informally of the National City Company whether it had made an advance
                            of $12,000,000 as installment on proposed future loan; and at the same
                            time advised company of Department’s attitude on loans and credits by
                            American bankers to Czechoslovakia at present. The company replied July
                            29, informing Department that the report was entirely erroneous and that
                            neither the National City Company nor the National City Bank had any
                            such credits outstanding at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Department informally advised by Dillon, Read and Company that today they
                            received cable from Logan, reporting that the National City Bank had
                            made private advances to the Czechoslovak Government up to $12,000,000
                            since June 15, 1925, and that the Government is not, therefore, in need

                        <p>46. On August 8 I saw President Masaryk at Carlsbad. He inquired in
                            regard to standing of National City Bank and said that the Government
                            was now negotiating loan with them, but stated in answer to my question
                            that he did not know if any advances had yet been made. An advance to
                            the Government of Czechoslovakia has been reported as having been made
                            through a local bank which has, in turn, received money from a foreign
                            bank, but I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of this statement. I do
                            not believe that the Government is in urgent need of funds, but I have
                            impression that it is finding difficulty in handling maturing short-term
                            notes and that it would welcome a loan to relieve it.</p>
                        <p>On August 5 I communicated through American Embassy, Berlin, the
                            Department’s position as outlined in its telegram No. 30, July 23, 1
                            p.m., to Vice President Weeks of the National City Bank who had been in

                        <p>Mr. Ralph Crews, Counsel for the National City Company, telephoned this
                            afternoon to say that representatives of the Czechoslovak Government
                            desired to negotiate with the National City Company in connection with
                            certain loans desired by them. Mr. Crews stated that the Czechoslovak
                            representatives informed him that they had signed an agreement for the
                            funding of the indebtedness of Czechoslovakia to the United States, but
                            in view of the Department’s correspondence last summer with the National
                            City Company, he desired to have definite advice as to the Department’s
                            position with respect to such negotiations. I told Mr. Crews that I
                            would endeavor to telephone him an answer to his inquiry during the
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>I spoke with the Secretary about this matter and was informed by him that
                            he had discussed the general question with Mr. Mellon and Mr. Hoover and
                            that all three had agreed that no objection would be offered by this
                            Government to negotiations looking to Czechoslovak financing in this
                            country. Accordingly I telephoned Mr. Crews that the Department had no
                            objection to negotiations between the National City Company and the
                            Czechoslovak Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: In order to forward to
                            my Government under the head of information some ideas concerning the
                            execution of the Convention signed in this city on December 27, 1924,
                            between the United States of America and the Dominican Republic, which
                            is awaiting the approval of the Dominican Congress, I have the honor to
                            ask Your Excellency kindly to give me the ideas of the Department on the
                            points herein below presented: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It has been contended in the Dominican Republic that the
                                    wording of paragraph 1 of Article VII of the above-mentioned
                                    Convention according to which “these agreements will go into
                                    force after they are approved by the contracting parties”,
                                    supposes that the consolidation of the debt must take place
                                    before the exchange of ratifications of the treaty. Does the
                                    Secretary of State understand, as I do, that the exchange of
                                    ratifications precedes the consolidation of the debt, and is an
                                    indispensable requisite for the issue of the bonds of the
                                    contemplated $25,000,000 loan?</item>

                                    follows: “Until the Dominican Republic has paid the whole amount
                                    of the bonds of the debt its public debt shall not be increased
                                    except by previous agreement between the Dominican Government
                                    and the United States”. Does the phrase “the whole amount of the
                                    bonds of the debt” refer in, the Convention of 1924 to the bonds
                                    to be issued for $25,000,000 in the same way as the same phrase
                                    in the Convention of 1907 had reference to the bonds also to be
                                    issued for $20,000,000? If so, does the State Department
                                    understand that the “previous agreement” between the two
                                    governments <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0129"/>for the
                                    contract of the $25,000,000 loan results from the approval and
                                    ratification of the Convention of 1924, or on the contrary,
                                    there is required a separate and special agreement at the time
                                    of the issue of the new bonds?</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Since the Convention of 1924 has no stipulation in any
                                    particular form for the issuance of the $25,000,000 bonds, does
                                    the Department consider, as I do, that its language admits of
                                    the possibility both of one emission for the whole amount stated
                                    and various partial issues as may best serve the interests of
                                    the Dominican Republic?</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Article VII of the Convention of 1924 provides that when the
                                    ratifications of the said convention shall have been exchanged
                                    the Convention of February 8, 1907, shall be considered at an
                                    end. This being so, what would be the condition of the bonds
                                    issued under the Convention of 1907 that may not have been
                                    redeemed after the exchange of ratifications and before the
                                    consolidation of the debt? It seems evident that the Convention
                                    of 1907 having terminated, those bonds would stand under the
                                    protection of the Convention of 1924, and would continue to be
                                    governed as to the payment of interest and manner of
                                    amortization by the law enacted for every issue. The holders of
                                    such bonds could not invoke any vested right to claim that the
                                    Convention of 1907 is in force since the new convention extends
                                    to them the same guarantees.</item>

                            after its approval by the Contracting Parties” implies that the
                            refunding of the Republic’s debt must be undertaken before the exchange
                            of ratifications of this Convention, and you inquire whether I share
                            your understanding that the exchange of ratifications should, on the
                            contrary, take place prior to the refunding of the Republic’s debt as an
                            indispensable prerequisite to the issuance of the bonds of the proposed
                                <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0130"/>loan of $25,000,000. In
                            reply, I desire to state that this Government understands that the
                            exchange of ratifications must of necessity take place prior to the
                            proposed refunding of the Republic’s outstanding debt in view of the
                            fact that the Convention cannot enter into effect until after
                            ratifications have been exchanged and since the provisions of the
                            Convention operating as guarantees for the proposed loan of $25,000,000
                            must become effective prior to the issuance of the bonds of the proposed
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>You state (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that Article III of the Convention
                            of 1924, which follows the text of Par. 1 of the same article of the
                            Convention of 1907, is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Until the Dominican Republic has paid the whole amount of the
                                    bonds of the debt, its public debt shall not be increased except
                                    by previous agreement between the Dominican Government and the
                                    United States”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>You inquire whether “the whole amount of the bonds of the debt” refers in
                            the Convention of 1924 to the proposed bond issue of $25,000,000 and you
                            ask whether in this event the Department of State understands that the
                            “previous agreement” between the two Governments for the negotiation of
                            the loan of $25,000,000 becomes effective as the result of the signing
                            and ratification of the Convention of 1924, or whether, on the contrary,
                            a distinct and special agreement is required before the new bonds are
                            issued. In reply, I desire to state that it is the understanding of this
                            Government that a special agreement will be required on the part of the
                            Governments of the United States and of the Dominican Republic prior to
                            the issuance of the proposed bond issue of $25,000,000, or any portion
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>You inquire (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) whether in view of the fact that
                            the Convention of 1924 does not stipulate any special form for the
                            issuance of the bonds of the proposed loan of $25,000,000 it is the
                            understanding of the Department of State, as you state it is yours, that
                            the provisions of the Convention admit the possibility of one series of
                            bonds for the total amount above mentioned as well as of various series
                            totalling $25,000,000, as the best interest of the Dominican Republic
                            may determine. In reply, I may inform you that this Government considers
                            that the terms of the Convention under reference admit the possibility
                            of the issuance of the bonds of the proposed loan up to the total of
                            $25,000,000 either in one series or in several series as the best
                            interest of the Dominican Republic may from time to time determine.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you state (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that Article VII of the
                            Convention of 1924 provides that upon the exchange of ratifications of
                            this Convention, the Convention as signed on February 8, 1907, shall be
                            deemed to be abrogated, and you inquire what will be the condition of
                            the bonds issued during the life of and in accordance with the
                            provisions of <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0131"/>the Convention of
                            1907 which may still be outstanding after the exchange of ratifications
                            of the Convention of 1924 prior to their conversion. You state that it
                            appears evident that upon the abrogation of the Convention of 1907 such
                            bonds would be guaranteed by the provisions of the Convention of 1924
                            and that the payment of interest upon such bonds and the manner of
                            providing for their eventual amortization would be governed by the terms
                            of the legislation passed authorizing the issuance of the series of
                            which they form a part. You further state that the holders of such bonds
                            could not invoke any legal right to insist upon the continuation of the
                            Convention of 1907 in view of the fact that the new Convention, that of
                            1924, provides the same guarantees as the former Convention. In reply to
                            this last inquiry, I desire to state that I share your understanding
                            that upon the abrogation of the Convention of 1907 all bonds then
                            outstanding will be guaranteed by the provisions of the Convention of
                            1924 and that the payment of interest upon such bonds and the manner of
                            providing for their eventual amortization will be governed by the terms
                            of the legislation passed authorizing the issuance of the series of
                            which they form a part. In order that our common understanding upon this
                            point may become a matter of record I wish to suggest an exchange of
                            notes confirming this understanding. I shall be glad to have you advise
                            me whether this suggestion meets with your approval.</p>

                        <p rend="center">I</p>
                        <p>Señor Angel Morales, former Minister of the Interior and Police in the
                            Cabinet of President Vasquez, arrived in Washington on March 27, as the
                            Confidential Agent of the President to take up with the Department of
                            State various matters of interest to this Government, principally
                            certain questions affecting the interpretation to be given certain
                            articles in the Convention signed December 27, 1924, at present pending
                            ratification by the Dominican Government.</p>
                        <p>The chief purpose of Señor Morales’ visit was to ascertain whether the
                            Government of the United States would see any objection <pb n="50"
                                xml:id="pg_50" facs="0132"/>to the ratification by the Dominican
                            Congress of the new Convention with certain reservations contained in a
                            draft which he handed to me, which project contained, as well, in the
                            law of ratification certain limitations to be placed by the Congress
                            upon the Executive in the negotiation of the loan of $25,000,000
                            contemplated in the Convention. (See Annex A.)<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d40fn4">Not printed.</note> After discussion of this
                            project, I suggested to Mr. Morales the desirability of modifying the
                            proposed limitations to be placed upon the Executive’s authority so that
                            the Executive would be permitted as much freedom as possible in his
                            dealings with the bankers. These modifications were at once accepted by
                            the President, who was kept in touch, during the course of our
                            conferences, by cable, with all developments. The reservations
                            contemplated in the law of ratification are identical with those
                            reservations contained in the law ratifying the Convention of 1907. I
                            inquired of Señor Morales whether, should the new Convention be ratified
                            in this manner, the Dominican Government would be satisfied with a reply
                            from the Department of State identical in substance to the reply
                            addressed by Secretary Root to the Dominican Minister in Washington when
                            he was notified by the latter of the ratification of the Convention of
                            1907 in a similar manner.<note n="5" xml:id="d40fn5">See <ref

                            stated that such a reply would be entirely acceptable to his Government.
                            Duplicate copies of the proposed law of ratification were prepared and
                            these copies were initialed by Señor Morales and myself. One of these
                            copies is attached hereto as Annex B. The proposed law of ratification
                            in the form initialed was approved by the Secretary upon the
                            understanding that the reply of our Government above indicated would be
                            acceptable to the Dominican Government as Señor Morales advised me.<note

                        <p>Mr. Alvarez called this afternoon to show me the Dominican instrument of
                            ratification of the new Convention signed by the President and the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, which had just arrived from Santo Domingo.
                            This document contains the “explanations” of the Convention and certain
                            other provisions incorporated by the Dominican Congress in its Act
                            approving the Convention. I informed Mr. Alvarez that I understood that
                            this document would not be acceptable, as the Department desired that
                            the procedure adopted with respect to the Convention of 1907 should be
                            followed, and that President Vasquez’s instrument of ratification should
                            contain only the actual text of the new Convention, as approved by the
                            Congress of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Alvarez appeared to understand this and drafted a telegram to his
                            Government to forward another instrument of ratification omitting
                            explanations and additions.</p>
                        <p>I reminded him that in 1907 an exchange of notes was effected between the
                            Dominican Legation and the Department, in which the former invited the
                            attention of the Department, to the “explanations” contained in the Act
                            of approval of the Dominican Congress and the latter replied by
                            accepting these statements, but stipulating that they could not form a
                            part of the Convention itself. Mr. Alvarez assured me that this note
                            would be presented when the correct instrument of ratification arrived
                            in Washington.</p>

                            explanations in no wise change the text of the Convention and only serve

                        <p>The difference which exists between the “Aclaraciones” (explanations)
                            incorporated in the Congressional Resolution approving the Convention of
                            1924 and those which are contained in the Resolution approving the
                            Convention of 1907 is caused by certain doubts which arose in Congress
                            when the Convention of 1924 was submitted to it. These doubts referred
                            principally: <list>
                                <label><hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>To the authorization required to contract the loan. It was
                                    thought that the approval of the Convention might be interpreted
                                    as implying an authorization to issue the loan of $25,000,000
                                    both by the Dominican Congress and by the Department of
                                    State.</item>

                                <item>To the co-existence of the two Conventions as well as other
                                    legal provisions as long as the consolidation of the debt was
                                    not effected. The bonds of 1908 are governed by the Convention
                                    of 1907, those of 1918 by Executive Orders 193<note n="11"

                                    ratifications of the new Convention, it was thought that the
                                    bonds of 1908 would be governed with respect to the manner of
                                    amortization by the provisions of the revised Convention, and
                                    that the same conditions would affect the bonds of 1918 and
                                    1922.</item>

                            points: namely, the Dominican Congress has stated in its resolution that
                            the approval of the Convention does not carry an authorization to issue
                            the loan of $25,000,000, and that before the consolidation of the debt

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note of October 5, 1925, transmitting a legalized copy
                            of the <hi rend="italic">Gaceta Oficial</hi> No. 3650, dated May 27,
                            1925, of the Dominican Government, which contains Resolution No. 179 of
                            the Congress of the Dominican Republic voted on May 23 and 25, 1925,
                            approving the Convention between the United States and the Dominican
                            Republic signed at Washington on December 27, 1924. This Resolution
                            comprises certain explanatory statements, two of which are identical
                            with those incorporated in the Resolution of the Dominican Congress
                            approving the Convention of February 8, 1907, and the remaining three,
                            which are called “Articles”, set forth the understanding of the
                            Dominican Congress with respect to the issuance of the contemplated
                            loan, with respect to the service of the existing bond issues after the
                            abrogation of the Convention of February 8, 1907, and with respect to
                            the exchange of ratifications of the Convention. You state that these
                            explanatory statements were incorporated by the Dominican Congress in
                            its Resolution of approval with the understanding that they in no wise
                            change the text of the Convention and only serve to dispel any doubt
                            that may exist as to its interpretation.</p>
                        <p>The first two explanations seem to be in the nature of statements of what
                            the Dominican Congress considers that the operation of this Convention
                            will be. If I understand them correctly, they entirely agree with the
                            views entertained by the United States. In order to avoid any
                            possibility that I may misunderstand the somewhat general language of
                            the first explanation relating to Article I of the Convention, <pb
                                n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0137"/>I will observe that the
                            understanding of the Government of the United States is that the vesting
                            in the President of the United States under that Article of the power to
                            appoint a General Receiver, Assistant Receiver, and other employees of
                            the Receivership will not exclude or prevent the appointment of any
                            other officers or employees by the Dominican executive authority; but
                            such other officers or employees would not be authorized to take part in
                            the collection of the customs revenues or other duties of the
                            Receivership, except as they render assistance to the General Receiver,
                            with his approval.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the three Articles contained in the Resolution of
                            approval, this Department concurs in the understanding of the Dominican
                            Congress as set forth in Articles I and III. The Department has also
                            given careful consideration to the statements concerning Article II
                            contained in your undated memorandum received on October 8th. These
                            statements indicate that the views of the Dominican Congress in regard
                            to the interpretation of this Article are similar to those of this
                            Government, namely, that its provisions are not intended to apply to the
                            loan contemplated by the Convention of December 27, 1924, but only to
                            the service of the outstanding bond issues until they shall have been
                            fully liquidated.</p>
                        <p>It thus appears that both Governments will construe the Treaty in the
                            sense of the explanations included in the Resolution of the Dominican
                            Congress. Your Government will, I am sure, understand that it is not
                            only unnecessary, but impossible for the President of the United States
                            to make these explanations and understandings any part of the Convention
                            which he is obliged to ratify, if at all, as it was approved by the
                            Senate of the United States, and that without the consent of the Senate
                            he cannot put into force any further or other treaty provisions. If
                            ratifications are to be exchanged it must therefore suffice that these
                            various explanations and understandings have developed entire harmony of
                            opinion between the two Governments regarding the meaning and effect of
                            the Convention, and the ratifications should be of the Convention itself
                            without including therein or appending thereto any explanations or
                            additions. This would appear to be the course necessary to give effect
                            to the intent of your Congress to alter in no respect the text of the
                            Convention.</p>

                        <p>The undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the

                            that he has received instructions from the Government of the Dominican
                            Republic to place on record its understanding with reference to the
                            Convention between the United States and the Dominican Republic signed
                            December 27, 1924, to replace the Convention of February 8, 1907,
                            between the two countries, that the words “all bonds outstanding” as
                            contained in the second paragraph of Article I of the Convention signed
                            December 27, 1924, as well as the words “said bonds” and “all bonds”,
                            wherever contained in that paragraph are intended to relate as well to
                            outstanding bonds of the issues of 1908, 1918 and 1922, referred to in
                            the preamble of the last mentioned Convention as to the bonds to be
                            issued in the future under the terms of that Convention, the result
                            being that the duties and functions of the General Receiver and the
                            assistant Receivers and other employees of the Receivership, as
                            enumerated and set forth in the said Article I of the Convention signed
                            December 27, 1924, are intended to continue in force and effect until
                            payment or retirement of any and all bonds issued by the Dominican
                            Government in 1908, 1918 and 1922, and of any and all bonds which shall
                            be issued under the terms of the last mentioned Convention. In other
                            words, it is not intended that the abrogation of the Convention of 1907
                            shall affect the validity or security of the rights of the holders of
                            bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of that Convention or
                            expressly recognized by the Convention of Ratification signed June 12,
                            1924, as legally binding upon the Dominican Republic, nor in any way
                            modify the terms of obligations of the Dominican Republic represented by
                            such bonds nor affect their respective rights of priority as to interest
                            or amortization or redemption over each other and over subsequent loans,
                            the understanding being that the Receiver General of the Dominican
                            Customs whether holding office under the Convention of 1907 or the
                            Convention of 1924 shall after paying the expenses of the receivership,
                            apply the revenues collected by him to the service of such issues of
                            bonds as are now outstanding and until their eventual payment or
                            redemption, before applying such revenues to the payment of either
                            interest on or the principal of subsequent loans.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned further has the honor to say that he has been instructed
                            by his Government to say that it understands that the provisions of the
                            Convention of 1924 relating to a contemplated loan of twenty-five
                            million dollars, do not contemplate that such amount shall be issued as
                            one loan but authorize a series of loans, the aggregate amount of which
                            at any time when added to the sum of the outstanding bonds of the issue
                            of 1908, 1918 and 1922 shall not exceed the said sum of twenty-five
                            million dollars, it being lastly understood that the General Receiver
                            shall apply the customs revenues collected by him to the payment of
                            interests and amortization as required by <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57"
                                facs="0139"/>each series, but always subordinate to the prior
                            obligations of earlier loans as before stated.</p>

                            1918 and 1922, referred to in the preamble of the last mentioned
                            Convention as to the bonds to be issued in the future under the terms of
                            that Convention, the result being that the duties and functions of the
                            General Receiver and the Assistant Receivers and other employees of the
                            Receivership, as enumerated and set forth in the said Article I of the
                            Convention signed December 27, 1924, are intended to continue in force
                            and effect until the payment or retirement of any and all bonds issued
                            by the Dominican Government in 1908, 1918 and 1922, and of any and all
                            bonds which shall be issued under the terms of the last mentioned
                            Convention. In other words, it is not intended that the abrogation of
                            the Convention of 1907 shall affect the validity or security of the
                            rights of the holders of bonds issued in accordance with the provisions
                            of that Convention or expressly recognized by the Convention of
                            Ratification signed June 12, 1924, as legally binding upon the Dominican
                            Republic, nor in any way modify the terms of obligations of the
                            Dominican Republic represented by such bonds nor affect their respective
                            rights of priority as to interest or amortization or redemption over
                            each other and over subsequent loans, the understanding being that the
                            Receiver General of the Dominican Customs whether holding office under
                            the Convention of 1907 or the Convention of 1924 shall after paying the
                            expenses of the receivership, apply the revenues collected by him to the
                            service of such issues of bonds as are now <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58"
                                facs="0140"/>outstanding and until their eventual payment or
                            redemption, before applying such revenues to the payment of either
                            interest on or the principal of subsequent loans.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States of America, has
                            further taken cognizance of the statement of the Envoy Extraordinary and
                            Minister Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Dominican Republic
                            that he has been instructed by his Government to say that it understands
                            that the provisions of the Convention of 1924 relating to a contemplated
                            loan of twenty-five million dollars, do not contemplate that such amount
                            shall be issued as one loan, but authorize a series of loans, the
                            aggregate amount of which at any time when added to the sum of the
                            outstanding bonds of the issues of 1908, 1918 and 1922 shall not exceed
                            the said sum of twenty-five million dollars, it being understood that
                            the General Receiver shall apply the customs revenues collected by him
                            to the payment of interest and amortization as required by each series,
                            but always subordinate to the prior obligations of earlier loans as
                            before stated.</p>
                        <p>The undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States of America, has
                            the honor to inform the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary
                            of the Dominican Republic that the Government of the United States
                            concurs in the views of the Dominican Government as set forth in the
                            preceding paragraphs.</p>

                                <p>“Taking into consideration the language in which the note which I
                                    answer is conceived, this Chancellery is compelled, with deep
                                    regret, to perform its duty, reminding Your Excellency that it
                                    considers procedure adopted by your Government as in absolute
                                    contradiction to the traditionally observed policy of the United
                                    States regarding questions of private right arising in foreign
                                    countries.</p>
                                <p>That policy has consistently denied the legality of all
                                    diplomatic claims, of all intervention of governments in matters
                                    of this nature: and [has been] accepted with enthusiasm by the
                                    American countries as a safeguard of the sovereignty of weak
                                    nations. Ecuador also always has invoked it in all cases in
                                    which it has judged it necessary to do so, and especially before
                                    your Excellency’s Government, which always has been its
                                    strongest supporter in innumerable documents and official
                                    declarations and in the valuable opinions of your most
                                    distinguished publicists.</p>
                                <p>In the matter of the claims of the Guayaquil and Quito Railway
                                    Company, this Department has clearly and succinctly stated to
                                    the Government of Your Excellency the reasons why the Ecuadorean
                                    Government did not and could not accept the diplomatic claim
                                    which then was attempted; and in this respect permit me to
                                    recall the contents of the notes directed to your predecessor,

                                <p>If then in a matter which dealt with a contract in which the
                                    Ecuadorean Nation was a part[y] it was not possible to consent
                                    that this principle of international right be attacked, how much
                                    less may it <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0142"/>consent to it
                                    now in a matter of the legal relations between the Associations
                                    of Agriculturalists and the Mercantile Bank, which in no
                                    way-affects the Ecuadorean Government.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, Mr. Minister, the Ecuadorean Chancellery cannot do
                                    less than record the surprise with which it has noticed the
                                    desire to place the debt of the Association of Agriculturalists
                                    upon the ground of diplomatic claim, when the course of ordinary
                                    justice is open but which it seems the parties have not even
                                    intended to follow and when there has been as yet no denial of
                                    justice, the sole instance in which international law recognizes
                                    the legality of such claims.</p>
                                <p>The special considerations held by the Chancellery for the
                                    distinguished and most worthy representative of the United
                                    States, Mr. Bading, cause me, while maintaining in all its vigor
                                    the foregoing statement and abstaining from concretely answering
                                    the points mentioned in the note of Your Excellency, to have the
                                    honor of transcribing here a report which for the information of

                                <p>“I have the honor to inform you that I have communicated to my
                                    Government your note of (supply date) and am instructed to reply
                                    as follows:</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States has noted with surprise that
                                    Your Excellency’s note gives no indication of any intention on
                                    the part of the Ecuadorean Government to meet the situation
                                    complained of in my note of (supply date). Your note merely
                                    asserts that this is not a case for diplomatic intervention and
                                    that no action has been taken in the Ecuadorean courts.</p>
                                <p>In reply to this contention I am instructed to say that the
                                    Government of the United States will always assert the right to
                                    interpose <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0143"/>diplomatically
                                    on behalf of its citizens whenever in its judgment there is
                                    occasion for such action. In the present instance it believes
                                    that there is such an occasion. My Government considers that the
                                    Association of Agriculturists of Ecuador is not to be regarded
                                    as a private concern, because of the public functions which it
                                    fulfills, and also because the Government of Ecuador has made
                                    itself responsible for the operation of the Association and the
                                    payment of its debts through the legislative decrees of December
                                    20, 1912, October 13, 1916, and October 15, 1921;<note n="6"

                                    various assurances given by successive Presidents of Ecuador
                                    both to the American Minister and to the Mercantile Bank.</p>
                                <p>In my note to which your note under acknowledgment is in reply it
                                    was pointed out that for the past three years the Association of
                                    Agriculturists has made no sincere attempt to reach a settlement
                                    in this matter. The equitable proposals on the part of the
                                    Mercantile Bank of the Americas, namely, arbitration before the
                                    Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America to determine
                                    the amount due the bank or, as an alternative, the auditing of
                                    the accounts by a well-known and reputable firm of certified
                                    public accountants, whose findings would be agreed to by both
                                    parties, have not been accepted by the Association of
                                    Agriculturists. During all these years no equitable way out has
                                    been suggested by the Association whose only proposition,
                                    besides refusing to accept accounts previously approved, was the
                                    presentation of a counter claim against the Bank based on purely
                                    fictitious sales. Furthermore the Association has deliberately
                                    discriminated against the Mercantile Bank by paying off all its
                                    other debts with the exception of one vale and has recently
                                    refused to pay even the twenty-two per cent allocated to the
                                    Mercantile Bank for the liquidation of its indebtedness or even
                                    to deposit this sum in escrow pending the acceptance of the
                                    amount of the accounts. In this connection it is pertinent to
                                    point out that the President of Ecuador has failed to take the
                                    necessary steps to bring about the satisfactory settlement of
                                    the matter, notwithstanding the power conferred upon him by law
                                    to control the affairs of the Association.</p>
                                <p>The only answer made by your Government regarding this most
                                    unsatisfactory situation was to maintain that there should be
                                    recourse to the courts of justice. My Government considers that
                                    it is justified in intervening on behalf of the Mercantile Bank
                                    in the present instance regardless of the absence of any
                                    litigation in the courts of Ecuador, because the Government of
                                    Ecuador through the express agreement of its Executive contained
                                    in his letter of February 5, 1922, to the American
                                        Minister,<note n="7" xml:id="d48fn7">Not printed.</note> and
                                    through subsequent assurances given by his successor has
                                    relieved the American claimant from any obligation to appeal to
                                    the courts. It may be added in this connection that no judicial
                                    remedy would be adequate which did not embrace a decree
                                    subjecting the state or Government to an <pb n="62"
                                        xml:id="pg_62" facs="0144"/>obligation to provide by law
                                    through appropriate taxation for the payment of the debts of the
                                    Company. Inasmuch as legislative action appears to be requisite,
                                    my Government sees no alternative short of an urgent request
                                    through the diplomatic channel that the State of Ecuador by the
                                    appropriate domestic process make the necessary provision for
                                    the payment of the debts due the Bank which have been lawfully
                                    incurred by the Association.</p>
                                <p>The facts in this case are so clear and indisputable that it was
                                    a source of sincere regret to my Government that the Ecuadorean
                                    Government should make no serious effort to bring about its
                                    proper solution but was rather content to fall back on
                                    generalities regarding diplomatic intervention and the pursuing
                                    of legal remedy in the courts of justice. I have just made known
                                    to you the reasons why my Government, which insists upon the
                                    right to interpose diplomatically in behalf of its citizens
                                    whenever occasion requires, feels that it is justified in
                                    interposing in the present case without awaiting litigation in
                                    the courts. My Government furthermore desires me to make known
                                    to the Ecuadorean Government that a continuance of the course
                                    followed in this case, especially the refusal of the Association
                                    of Agriculturists of Ecuador, a quasi-public institution, to
                                    make any attempt to meet its just obligations as well as the
                                    failure of the Ecuadorean authorities to take the necessary
                                    measures to that end, for which they hold authority of law,
                                    cannot be regarded as a stable basis on which to maintain
                                    international relations between friendly states, and it
                                    therefore expects to be informed of the measures contemplated by
                                    the Ecuadorean Government to bring the matter to a satisfactory
                                    conclusion. My Government is confident that, notwithstanding
                                    what has occurred, the Ecuadorean Government animated by the
                                    high purposes which the Government of the United States imputes
                                    to it will make adequate and prompt response to the request
                                    hereinabove set forth.”</p>

                        <p>Upon handing this note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs you may inform
                            him orally of the seriousness with which this Government regards the
                            situation and especially the attitude heretofore maintained by the
                            Ecuadorean Government. Keep Department fully advised of the results of
                            your representations.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase] The Department has carefully considered this case; if the
                            Ecuadorean Government should continue to maintain its unreasonable
                            attitude and not present a satisfactory reply within a reasonable time,
                            the Department would give serious consideration to the recall of the
                            Minister for consultation in regard to the situation, after which it
                            will decide whether or not it will continue to be represented by a
                            Minister Plenipotentiary and to receive a diplomatic representative of

                                paragraph.<note n="8" xml:id="d49fn8">Not printed; it instructed the

                                representing the Mercantile Bank.</note> in Guayaquil. The Legation
                            has just learned that an agreement has been reached, Mr. Stabler
                            reporting by telegraph May 1st that an agreement not yet signed on that
                            date provides that Association of Agriculturists cedes to the Mercantile
                            Bank 1,666,085 sucres being balance 66 percent tax since law of 1921 and
                            sums collected prior to this last month and free titles to association
                            real estate valued today at 350,000 sucres. Association deposits Banco
                            Comercial 1,271,566 sucres being balance 34 percent tax since law of ‘21
                            same not to be withdrawn until authorized by Congress which association
                            obligates itself to try to obtain next session (in August). Association
                            remains in existence with reduced expenses until the end of the year so
                            as to collect legally. It is estimated that tax should produce 1,600,000
                            sucres including April deposits, so bank should receive a total of from
                            4,800,000 to 5,000,000 sucres, approximately one million dollars.</p>
                        <p>Stabler has requested that the Department be informed of the necessity of
                            action by Congress in order that the American Government may point out
                            to the Ecuadorean Government the advisability of early passage of the
                            act by Congress as the association cannot use 34 percent, amounting to
                            1,815,566 sucres or over one-third of the total amount involved without
                            such authority.</p>
                        <p>Since the bank and the association apparently have reached this final
                            settlement it is presumed that the Department will desire to await the
                            reply of the Ecuadorean Government to the Department’s last note on the
                            subject before taking any further action. I shall again urge the

                            General Gomez de la Torre and the younger members of the Army took place
                            in Quito, Guayaquil and other cities of Ecuador. President Cordova and
                            all the members of the Cabinet together with some other individuals are
                            being held under guard in their homes. All is quiet here and present
                            indications are that there will be no bloodshed or public disorder.</p>
                        <p>The triumvirate at present in charge is made up of General Gomez de la
                            Torre, Señor Luis Napoleon Dillon and Jose Rafael Bustamente and it
                            seems others will be asked to join the new government today or tomorrow.
                            They seem to have the situation well under control but as all
                            telegraphic communication is being controlled we have no information as
                            to conditions outside of the Capital today. So far as we have been able
                            to learn all Americans in Ecuador are safe and no American interests are
                            endangered.</p>

                        <p>(2) For your information I informed the Minister confidentially that the
                            Department was awaiting action by the Senate on German commercial
                                treaty<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">Signed Dec. 8, 1923; see <ref

                            similar treaties. I then referred to complaints received from American
                            exporters concerning Finnish discriminations against American commerce,
                            also to the discriminatory port duties imposed on American <pb n="88"
                                xml:id="pg_88" facs="0170"/>ships by Finland, and stated that in
                            view of the very favorable treatment granted by the United States to
                            Finnish imports, which are largely admitted into the United States free
                            of duty (as in the case of wood pulp, hides and skins) it was obviously
                            unreasonable that Finland should discriminate against the United States.
                            The Minister stated he believed his Government would welcome such an
                            arrangement, but that it would have to be considered by a Committee in
                            Helsingfors and that because that Committee was probably dispersed
                            during the summer and because the Minister for Foreign Affairs was
                            absent there might be some delay. He stated that he would urge early
                            action but that he desired to study the note for two or three days
                            before making detailed recommendations to his government.</p>
                        <p>(3) In handing the Minister draft note I stated that Department would
                            cable the text to you to hand to the Finnish Government. Please hand a
                            copy as soon as possible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            endeavor to expedite favorable action so that Minister in Washington may
                            be authorized to enter into the proposed exchange as soon as possible.
                            Please telegraph important developments.</p>

                        <p>The Finnish Minister left with me today the appended revised draft as a
                            counter proposal of the Finnish Government for an exchange of notes to

                            most-favored-nation treatment. I said that we would study the matter
                            and, if necessary, would request him to come again to the Department to
                            explain any points in the revised draft which might not be clear.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the consular provisions, the Minister said that these had
                            been incorporated in the draft as they would tend to commend the

                            the preamble, would be enlarged so as to provide also for the treatment
                            to be accorded to “navigation, citizens, corporations and consuls
                            general, consuls, vice-consuls and consular agents”. The counter-draft
                            provides in its twelfth paragraph that the stipulations concerning
                            customs duties and navigation shall be brought into effect thirty days
                            after the exchange of notes shall have been made, and that with the
                            exception of these stipulations the arrangement shall become operative
                            after each party shall have notified the other that the necessary
                            legislative measures have been brought into effect.</p>
                        <p>Specific stipulations in regard to the subjects which the Government of
                            Finland proposes to add to the arrangement are introduced throughout the
                            counter-draft. With most of these proposals the Government of the United
                            States is sympathetic and it will be glad to consider them when
                            negotiations for a general treaty of friendship, commerce and consular
                            rights are resumed between the United States and Finland. The United
                            States is constrained, however, to request that, in the proposed <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, Finland will not insist on them.
                            It is the hope of the United States that the proposed <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> may become operative at an early date, but that
                            it will within a short time give place to a long-term general
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The particulars in which the counter-draft differs from the draft
                            submitted to the Minister of Finland by the Under Secretary of State may
                            be considered in order as follows:</p>
                        <p>The Government of Finland proposes to apply the stipulation in the second
                            paragraph for unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to navigation
                            and to “taxes, imposts or charges of whatever denomination”, as well as
                            to commerce, to transit, warehousing and other facilities, commercial
                            travelers’ samples and the licensing and prohibition of importations and
                            exportations.</p>
                        <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0174"/>
                        <p>The United States prefers that the treatment to be accorded its vessels
                            in ports of Finland and that to be accorded Finnish vessels in ports of
                            the United States should be on the basis of national rather than
                            most-favored-nation treatment. Under the laws of the United States
                            certain charges on navigation, known as alien tonnage taxes and light
                            money, which do not apply to vessels of the United States are chargeable
                            on vessels of foreign countries. By stipulations of treaties, vessels of
                            many maritime countries have been placed on an equality with vessels of
                            the United States with respect to these charges. Apart from an agreement
                            by treaty, the President is empowered by Act of Congress to suspend and
                            discontinue by proclamation the collection of alien tonnage taxes and
                            light money on the vessels of foreign countries, and also the collection
                            of discriminating duties on goods imported in vessels of such countries,
                            when he has received satisfactory proof from foreign governments that no
                            discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are levied in their ports on
                            the vessels of the United States or on the goods imported in them. The
                            method prescribed by the Act of Congress is considered as exclusive of
                            all other methods for the suspending of alien navigation charges except
                            stipulation by treaty. The Government of the United States is,
                            therefore, not in a position to accord by exchange of notes national
                            treatment to Finnish vessels in ports of the United States. It is ready,
                            however, to recommend to the President the issuance of his proclamation
                            according national treatment to Finnish vessels in ports of the United
                            States upon the receipt of formal assurances from the Government of
                            Finland that the discriminating charges against vessels of the United
                            States in ports of Finland have been discontinued and that no
                            discriminating tonnage or import dues are imposed or levied on American
                            ships or their cargoes in the ports of Finland. A copy of a proclamation
                            which the President issued in regard to the vessels of Germany is
                                enclosed.<note n="8" xml:id="d61fn8">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In reference to internal taxation it is necessary to mention that in the
                            United States both the Federal Government and the State Governments have
                            the power to levy taxes. It is within the power of both Federal and
                            State Governments to levy discriminating taxes upon aliens. By a treaty,
                            which under a provision of the Constitution is the supreme law of the
                            land, the United States may and does assure to the nationals of other
                            countries the same treatment in respect to taxation in the United States
                            as is enjoyed by nationals of the United States or by nationals of the
                            most favored nation. Such an assurance could not well be given by the
                            United States otherwise than by treaty. The provision in the
                            counter-draft that stipulations in regard to taxation will remain
                            inoperative until appropriate legislation is passed <pb n="93"
                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0175"/>for giving them effect, does not render
                            the proposal to include them in the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>
                            acceptable to the Government of the United States for the reason that it
                            is impracticable for the Federal Government to undertake to obtain the
                            necessary legislation. The Government of the United States, accordingly,
                            must ask the Government of Finland to omit the matter of internal
                            taxation from the proposed <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> and
                            leave it for consideration when the proposed commercial treaty is under
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The counter-draft contains a paragraph according most-favored-nation
                            treatment to citizens and corporations of Finland in the United States
                            and to citizens and corporations of the United States in Finland. Here,
                            also, authority, except when exercised through treaty, is divided
                            between the Federal Government and the governments of the States. The
                            latter may within their sphere discriminate between nationals and aliens
                            and between domestic and foreign corporations. It is, therefore, not
                            practicable for the Government of the United States to consider this
                            proposal of the Finnish Government except in the negotiation of a
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The counter-draft also contains a paragraph according most-favored-nation
                            treatment to consular officers. It has not been the practice of the
                            United States to enter into agreements permitting the exercise of
                            consular functions in this country otherwise than by treaty and this
                            Government regards it as impracticable to enter into such an agreement
                            in an exchange of notes. The Government of the United States must,
                            accordingly, request that the Government of Finland defer consideration
                            of consular rights until such time as a treaty may be under negotiation
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>To the exceptions from the matters to which the proposed <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> relates the Government of Finland
                            adds the following: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    actually accords or may hereafter accord to Sweden in respect to
                                    navigation north of 59° north latitude; the treatment which
                                    Finland actually accords or may hereafter accord to Russia in
                                    regard to fishing and sealing in the Arctic waters of Finland;
                                    nor the treatment which Finland accords to France in Article 6
                                    of the Treaty of Commerce concluded between Finland and France
                                    July 13, 1921.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the United States must ask that matters relating
                            to navigation be excluded from the pending <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi>, the first of these exceptions becomes irrelevant.
                            Likewise, as the subjects of fishing and sealing are not embraced in the
                            notes, an exception with respect to particular privileges in these
                            matters is unnecessary. The Government of the United States is glad to
                            accede to the wishes of the Government of Finland and to except from the
                            matters to which the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> relates the
                            treatment which <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0176"/>Finland accords
                            to France in Article 6 of the Treaty of Commerce of July 13, 1921.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the exception “or regulations for the enforcement of
                            police or revenue laws”, contained in the paragraph the fourth from the
                            end of the original draft, does not appear in the counter-draft. This
                            exception is deemed important by the Government of the United States and
                            it is requested that the Government of Finland agree to its retention in
                            the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi.</hi></p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the United States must insist upon confining the
                            present exchange of notes to the subject of commerce, it is assumed that
                            the Government of Finland will not care to retain the proposal for
                            changing the provisions of the original note in regard to the coming
                            into force of the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>. The Government
                            of the United States must, moreover, request the retention of the

                        <p>28. The Finnish Minister here informed the Department on November 23 that
                            a treaty between Finland and Spain, providing for certain conventional
                            duties lower than the lowest rates the Government is authorized to grant
                            without legislative approval, will go into effect on November 27.<note

                            ratified by the Diet, the Minister states that his Government is not
                            empowered to extend conventional duties to American goods as
                            contemplated by the most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>Please keep Department fully informed and, unless you have reasons for
                            not doing so, you should urge the Finnish Government to bring about
                            ratification at the earliest practicable date and make it retroactive to
                            November 27. Should some days intervene an arrangement might be made for
                            admitting goods under bond or remitting duties paid in excess of the new
                            conventional rates as soon as the commercial agreement of May 2 is fully
                            ratified. The best means for protecting American interests would seem to
                            depend upon the exact situation and you are accordingly authorized to
                            use your best judgment in the matter.</p>

                                memorandum; the draft referred to is apparently the one signed by
                                the Secretary of State Dec. 21, 1925, <hi rend="italic"
                                >infra.</hi></note> differs in no essential respect from the draft
                            approved by the Department and handed to the Finnish Minister on May 2,
                            1925.</p>
                        <p>The Finnish Minister requested that the language of the note specifically
                            set forth the fact that it does not apply to the Finnish requirements
                            for the employment of pilots on vessels making use of its harbors; and
                            also that it does not apply to the treatment accorded by Finland to
                            Russian fishing vessels in Arctic waters.</p>
                        <p>Very probably the notes would not be interpreted as applying to either of
                            these matters even in the absence of language especially excepting them.
                            They appear to be of no interest to the United States and, accordingly,
                            it would seem wise to accept them at the request of the Finnish
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>The matter of the employment of pilots is distinct from that of pilotage
                            dues when pilots are employed. Where employment is required equality of
                            dues to American vessels will be accorded. Exemption from the employment
                            of pilots is, according to the statement of the Minister, confined to
                            small vessels flying the flag of Finland or the flags of neighboring
                            Baltic countries.</p>

                            statement of my understanding of the agreement reached through recent
                            conversations held <pb n="102" xml:id="pg_102" facs="0184"/>at

                        <p>These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two
                            Governments, as follows:</p>
                        <p>On and after February 1, 1926, Finland will impose no tonnage duties,
                            light, harbor or port dues, or other charges on vessels of the United
                            States in the ports of Finland which are not imposed on vessels of
                            Finland, and Finland will levy no higher or other duties or charges on
                            goods imported into its ports in vessels of the United States than are
                            levied on like goods imported in vessels of Finland.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that, without altering the above stipulations insofar as
                            the amount of pilotage dues is concerned, the duty of employing pilots
                            by vessels of the United States shall be governed by the stipulations of
                            the Finnish law in this respect about foreign vessels in general. It is
                            also understood that the United States of America shall not, on the
                            ground of the above stipulations, claim any privileges which Finland has
                            conceded or will concede to Russian fishing or sealing vessels in the
                            Arctic waters.</p>
                        <p>The United States will impose no discriminating duties of tonnage on
                            vessels of Finland in the ports of the United States and no
                            discriminating imposts on the goods imported into the United States in
                            vessels of Finland. This undertaking on the part of the United States
                            will be effected by a proclamation to be issued by the President of the
                            United States on the receipt of notification by him from the Government
                            of Finland that the undertaking on the part of Finland stated in the
                            preceding paragraphs has been brought into force.</p>
                        <p>The present arrangement, unless sooner terminated by mutual agreement,
                            shall continue in force until thirty days after notice of its
                            termination shall have been given by either party; or, should either
                            party be prevented by future action of its legislature from carrying out
                            the terms of this arrangement the obligations thereof shall thereupon
                            lapse.</p>

                            a manner which they consider intolerable; and (3) the arrest and
                            deportation of notables of importance who were called, on the pretext of
                            a conference, to Damascus.</p>
                        <p>On August 3d the French in their initial advance to relieve the garrison
                            besieged at Souada were repulsed and forced to withdraw from Djebel
                            Druse to their base at Ezraa. Many were killed and wounded and a great
                            deal of artillery, ammunition, and supplies was abandoned. The defeat
                            was due: (1) to a formidable attack of the Druses on the French main
                            column as well as on the line of communications; (2) to exhaustion of
                            the troops, caused by inadequate water and excessive heat; and (3) to
                            the desertion of some of the Syrian and colonial units.</p>
                        <p>In the whole of Syria the French forces number only 8,000 colonial troops
                            and 6,000 Syrian legion. The only French troops are technical units.</p>
                        <p>The French military situation here is fraught with dangerous
                            possibilities. Increasing disaffection with resulting dangerous
                            situation would probably follow the circulation of propaganda by Arab
                            Moslems among the colonial and Syrian troops.</p>
                        <p>It is feared that unless important reenforcements arrive, the present
                            forces will be insufficient to cope with the Druse uprising and at the
                            same time to repel probably increasing raids along the Turkish frontier
                            and the widespread brigandage which will undoubtedly prevail throughout
                            the country as a result of the present situation.</p>

                        <p>Fearing serious disorder, the French authorities at Damascus have sent
                            their families to Beirut and have advised the American and Italian
                            consuls to do likewise.</p>

                        <p>Department’s telegram of August 10, noon. It is not necessary or
                            advisable to have American destroyers sent here at present. The only
                            American citizens now in the affected region are naturalized citizens of
                            Syrian origin who are living in their native villages. Order is being
                            maintained in Damascus by reenforced police and troops. So far the rest
                            of the country is quiet.</p>
                        <p>According to late information which is thought to be reliable, 5,000
                            French troops and a somewhat larger number of Druses were engaged in the
                            battle of August 3. The French casualties are given as 1,200 and the
                            Druses’ 2,500, the latter resulting from sacrifices in a successful
                            movement to lure the main body of French troops into an ambush. There is
                            a rumor that since that battle the Druses have taken Souada with the
                            besieged French garrison of about 400 soldiers. No further action is
                            reported, the Druses for the moment remaining on the defensive and the
                            French entrenching 6 miles south of Damascus and Kiswe. The French are
                            awaiting reenforcements, of whom several hundred have since arrived.</p>

                            points in Syria as well as the Lebanon. On October 4th Bedouins attacked
                            Hama and assisted by local gendarmes burned public buildings. French
                            rushed troops and aeroplanes and destroyed practically entire Moslem
                            quarter by bombing, causing casualties about 500.</p>
                        <p>Three villages within Lebanon have been sacked and destroyed by Druse
                            raiders who are reported to have surrounded Rasheya.</p>

                            refugees in Hauran. New developments indicate possibly increased number
                            refugees and need for additional relief funds. Railway Beirut-Damascus

                            Damascus were burned by French for having, it is alleged, given refuge
                            to brigands. Relatives of killed and other sympathizers now in arms
                            against French in environs Damascus reported to number 3,000. Moslem
                            sympathizers in Damascus enraged at French action are now in revolt.
                            Keeley has just reported by telephone that French are bombarding city of
                            Damascus with field guns and aeroplanes and that city is on fire. He
                            believes both railway and automobile road too unsafe to send his family
                            away. It is rumored also that Armenian refugees in Damascus have been
                            massacred. The situation serious because the revolt at Damascus may be

                            money or arms and that if, for failure to pay such fine, he recommences
                            bombardment, it must be upon his own responsibility. … If bombardment

                        <p>391. I desire you to make immediate and vigorous representations to
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs that this Government expects that all
                            possible steps will be taken for the protection of American lives and
                            property in Syria. In your representations you may make discreet use of
                            information contained in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Department’s 390<note
                                n="6" xml:id="d84fn6">Not printed.</note> which tends to indicate
                            failure on part of French authorities to extend adequate protection to
                            American citizens in Damascus as well as a failure to give reasonable
                            warning of impending danger to American Consul and our nationals from
                            French bombardment and evacuation of their troops.</p>
                        <p>Further you may indicate that this Government reserves the right to
                            demand settlement for any injury to American citizens and property and
                            to make such further representations as the facts of the case may
                            warrant in the event that it should appear that injury to American
                            citizens or destruction of American property had resulted from
                            unjustifiable action of the French Military forces. In this connection
                            note what Keeley says with reference to French bombardment.</p>

                            p.m. Now estimated that 12,000 Armenians who were refugees at Damascus
                            are now in dire distress as result of Damascus incidents last week.
                            Driven from their camps which with all their worldly goods were
                            destroyed, they are now living in distress chiefly in churches, schools
                            and garages in Damascus, needing food and clothing, while a few hundred
                            have come to Beirut. Please inform American Red Cross and Near East
                            Relief. I repeat recommendation that Red Cross send $50,000 immediately
                            and possibly more later.</p>

                                    delivery of rifles. He is grandson of Abdel Kader who protected

                                    in Damascus, is now reliably reported to be in the outskirts of
                                    Damascus with 300 men. Other bands are operating in surrounding
                                    villages. All bands undoubtedly operating under the direction of

                            part, as appears from your telegrams, to tactics adopted in Syria by
                            France. Relief appropriation by Red Cross at this time might create
                            impression that Red Cross would assume a continuing responsibility to

                        <p>I have received from High Commissioner written assurance requested by
                            note quoted in my telegram October 28, 4 p.m. He expresses strong
                            conviction that uprising here improbable. I concur but believe it is not
                            impossible. Keeley reports by telephone: (1) Only 2,200 rifles delivered
                            to date; (2) destruction of houses throughout the disturbed area has
                            made many thousands homeless, many of whom are joining ranks of
                            brigands, numbers of whom [omission?] and now becoming formidable; (3)
                            French have apparently taken no precautionary measures to prevent
                            reentry of brigands into Damascus; (4) several districts near Damascus
                            in the hands of brigands have declared their independence.</p>
                        <p>Brigand movement in Damascus and other regions shows indications of
                            development into a widespread organized revolutionary movement.</p>

                        <p>Department’s telegram of October 29, 2 p.m. My recommendation for relief
                            native refugees was based upon fact of their actual destitute condition
                            and belief that Red Cross desired to come to relief if need could be
                            shown to be real. There is no doubt that refugee situation is due
                            primarily to French tactics and that the responsibility therefor rests
                            entirely upon the French. The Department and Red Cross are fully
                            justified in so deciding and I withdraw my recommendation. New York
                            headquarters, Near East Relief, seem to be contemplating extension
                            relief and I therefore suggest that they be informed of the Department’s
                            views of the matter.</p>

                        <p>Keeley reports by telephone that a large force is concentrating outside
                            Damascus threatening to attack the French and that the attack is
                            momentarily expected. Information from other sources is to the effect
                            that it is a combined force of Druses and revolutionists of Damascus
                            area numbering 8,000. It is reported that railroad between Rayak and
                            Horns has been cut. Rumors which may or may not be well-founded are to
                            effect that a general uprising including Beirut of Moslems against
                            French is imminent being encouraged it is believed by the recall of
                            Sarrail and attitude of the foreign papers against French action
                            here.</p>

                            immediate presence American destroyers here is highly desirable not only
                            for the moral effect of their presence in possibly preventing an
                            uprising but to provide effective means of protection in case uprising
                            occurs. I have consequently requested destroyers to arrive here on the
                            morning of November 5th.</p>

                        <p>Having worked in close friendly personal and official cooperation with
                            Gouraud, Weygand, De Caix and Dereffye, I offer, as an impartial but
                            friendly observer, my unbiased opinion that, as a result of the
                            incidents which occurred during the current year culminating in the
                            Damascus affair, France’s position in Syria and the Lebanon is in many
                            ways more difficult today than it has been since 1919 and that her
                            prestige here is at its lowest ebb. It is the general consensus of
                            opinion among all classes of people that because of the high respect and
                            confidence in which they hold Weygand he is the one Frenchman who might
                            reestablish France’s position here at less cost and effort than could be
                            accomplished by a stranger to the people, be he ever so able. It has
                            been the general belief that if Weygand were to replace Sarrail and be
                            authorized to demand no indemnity and to grant amnesty to all political
                            offenders, which under the circumstances seemed to be the only just
                            policy to pursue, the gravest problems would have been overcome almost
                            instantaneously. However latest indications are that the situation may
                            soon be too far out of hand for a solution of the difficulty by the
                            policy outlined, even by Weygand. The chaos existing here at present has
                            caused an economic crisis which has materially affected our growing and
                            already important trade with this country and the reestablishment of
                            responsible government and public security is essential to our
                            commercial interests here. [Paraphrase.] I may add that when Weygand was
                            High Commissioner he was distinctly friendly to the United States and to
                            American interests here. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>My telegram of November 3, 4 p.m. Destroyers arrived morning of November

                            Lebanon, and French Admiral and the presence of destroyers has assumed
                            outward character of ordinary visit. Arrival has occasioned no
                            excitement or incidents. Information all sources indicates that reaction
                            in connection therewith is one of marked relief and sense of security
                            felt by all denominations and classes of people including foreigners. It
                            is general consensus of opinion that no uprising will occur Beirut while
                            American destroyers are in the harbor unless French meet with serious
                            reverses in the interior which contingency is not entirely improbable.
                            At the present moment there are practically no combatant French troops
                            in Beirut and their only means of suppressing uprising here is by
                            bombardment with artillery already in place for the purpose. French
                            expect 10,000 reenforcements during the course of the next 2 weeks.</p>
                        <p>Well-founded reports indicate organization native government with Sultan

                            Hayati, Minister of War, and that the various rebel bands in conjunction
                            with the Druses and Arab tribes organizing for concerted action against
                            French. Developments during the next two or three weeks will possibly
                            give clearer indication of the future.</p>
                        <p>… I recommend that destroyers remain until we on the ground are convinced
                            that adequate measures have been taken for the protection of American
                            citizens and their property without recourse to means[<hi rend="italic"

                            Constantinople to come to Beirut in advisory capacity.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully suggest following as proper policy: France by the terms of
                            the treaty is as responsible to the United States as to the League of

                            and our independent action up to date and as recommended is justifiable
                            under the circumstances in a country under mandate.</p>

                        <p>561. I have reason to think that French Government would very much like
                            to have our destroyers leave Beirut. The presence of these destroyers
                            has served as a pretext for Italy to send ships and the French suspect
                            that the Italians have political reasons for doing this. Furthermore,
                            the departure of the destroyers would almost coincide with the arrival
                            in Syria of the new French High Commissioner and would strengthen his
                            hand by showing the confidence of the American Government in an
                            improvement of conditions. The presence of the destroyers at Beirut does
                            not seem to be urgently needed, and therefore I suggest that they be
                            sent to some port near at hand, perhaps in Palestine or Cyprus, where
                            they could remain until the situation clears.</p>

                                <p>[“] November 11, 10 p.m. Referring to Department’s telegram of
                                    November 7, 1 p.m. to Beirut. The revolutionary movement being
                                    anti-French rather than antiforeign, Americans in Damascus at
                                    present have little to fear from the rebels except in being
                                    mistaken for Frenchmen, although the policy of the French in
                                    fortifying themselves inside the city instead of defending it
                                    from the outside exposes those around them to danger of being
                                    between two fires in the event of another rebel attack against
                                    the French in Damascus, an eventuality which is still entirely
                                    improbable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</p>
                                <p>Naturalized American citizens of Syrian origin in interior
                                    villages are exposed to the same danger as natives, namely: (1)
                                    being pillaged or killed by bandits for noncooperation, (2)
                                    being killed or rendered homeless by the French in wholesale
                                    reprisals against villages for failure to combat bandits, and
                                    (3) being victims of any of numerous misfortunes that accompany
                                    a state of guerrilla warfare or revolution. The French delegate
                                    admitted in a conversation this evening his inability to protect
                                    Americans in the disaffected regions or to guarantee them safe
                                    conduct to Damascus. With the expectation of reenforcements he
                                    hoped to reestablish order in the disaffected regions within the
                                    next 15 days. I consider that Americans in the interior will be
                                    in the greatest danger during the period of French attempt to
                                    restore order. While being sincerely appreciative of the
                                    Department’s solicitous provision for my personal safety I
                                    prefer to <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0203"/>remain in my
                                    district regardless of developments unless a serious exigency
                                    should arise or unless as a result of improbable future
                                    developments the Department might for reasons of policy instruct
                                    me to leave.”</p>

                        <p>It is rumored that a serious attack will be made upon Damascus on 15th or
                            16th. I have instructed Keeley to come to Beirut immediately for further
                            consultation and bring his family, which at least I will insist must

                        <p>Shahbender is reported to have arrived at Mecca to bring about
                            reconciliation Ibn Saud and King Ali in their local differences and
                            persuade them to take part in the league movement involving North Africa
                            and Near East and support for Syrian revolutionists. If he is successful
                            the Metoualis, Alaregtes [<hi rend="italic">Alaouites</hi>] and Rouallas
                            and other Bedouin tribes will undoubtedly join the revolutionists. In
                            this event situation in Syria will become most serious. On the other
                            hand if present movement is not joined by the above-mentioned elements,
                            the French with present forces and reenforcements now arriving may
                            possibly get situation partially in hand with offensive scheduled for
                            the latter part of this month but I am not optimistic in this respect.

                        <p>Department’s telegram of November 14, 8 a.m. [<hi rend="italic"
                            >p.m.</hi>] As a result of Druse advance into Lebanon, French are arming
                            native Christians and inciting them to assist in repelling invaders.
                            This act it is generally believed will probably bring about a religious
                            war, chiefly between the Druse[s] and Marmorites [<hi rend="italic"
                                >Maronites</hi>] in the Lebanon, and may result in other religious
                            factions entering strife. Destroyers must remain until situation clears.
                            Fuller details tomorrow.</p>

                                that his Government had given him instructions to follow the policy
                                here of the United States. At his request Italian ships were sent to
                                Rhodes for purpose of protection. I am convinced they were not sent
                                for political reasons.</item>

                                arrives there will be a conference between him, Captain Fairfield,

                            <item>It would embarrass the French more to have the destroyers depart
                                and return later than it would to have them remain here. Having the
                                destroyers here gives a feeling of security to Americans,
                                foreigners, and the natives … The continued presence of the
                                destroyers is justified for that reason alone. On the other hand,
                                people would become panicky should our destroyers be withdrawn now,
                                and such action would be generally condemned.</item>

                            <item>The arming of Christians throughout the Lebanon by the French has
                                incensed the Moslems and Druses who are thus placed in potential
                                danger. Thus a most critical situation has been created which may
                                result in general religious warfare, especially throughout the
                                Lebanon. … Moslem and Druse leaders have taken the initiative in
                                arranging meetings with Christian leaders to keep the situation in
                                control and prevent a religious war but their efforts may be
                                rendered fruitless by the action of the French in arming the
                                Christians. Claims and counterclaims are made, but I am convinced
                                that the revolutionists have been, and are still, making every
                                effort not to molest Christians and that the Christians are molested
                                only when they oppose the advance of the revolutionists. Word has
                                been sent to me by leading Moslems and Druses asking that the United
                                States intervene to persuade the French to stop giving arms to
                                Christians.</item>

                        <p>Your telegram November 23, 6 p.m. The Department realizes that it may be
                            desirable to arrange to have destroyers withdrawn before the new French
                            High Commissioner arrives or at the time of his arrival. The Department,
                            however, before authorizing such action desires to have you give a more
                            detailed report indicating that you believe present conditions are such
                            as fully to justify the departure of the destroyers.</p>
                        <p>Alarmist reports still appear in the newspapers regarding the military
                            situation in Syria. It might, therefore, result in misunderstanding in
                            this country should the destroyers be withdrawn. The Department <pb
                                n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0207"/>does not desire to give
                            discretionary authority until the reports from you as to the adequacy of
                            measures taken by the French to protect American lives and property are
                            more reassuring.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the Department’s telegram November 24th, 8 p.m. From a
                            technical point of view it was believed that the military operations
                            taking place when my telegram of November 23, 6 p.m. was sent would
                            result in a defeat of the Druses who had entered Southern Lebanon and
                            their withdrawal into the interior and that henceforth all operations
                            would be confined to the interior and that the coastal region would
                            remain safe from attack. However the 4,000 French troops sent against
                            the Druses at Rashaya succeeded only in relieving the garrison in the
                            nick of time. The Druses numbering several thousand are now in

                            reenforcements from the Djebel Druse for an offensive in the Lebanon. In

                            Rashaya weakened the position there, the railway south of Horns was cut
                            and fearing the seizure of the town by the rebels half the population
                            have left upon the advice of the French authorities. Altaffer reports:

                        <p>While some seven or eight thousand reenforcements have been received
                            during the past 2 weeks it is believed that at least 20,000 additional
                            troops are required.</p>
                        <p>Colonel Foy and Captain Fairfield believe that the disturbances will be
                            confined indefinitely to the interior and that therefore destroyers are
                            no longer required here. Inasmuch as there are in my opinion so many
                            potential possibilities for more widespread disturbances I must
                            recommend continued presence of destroyers until the situation becomes
                            more clarified. Also sent to Embassy at Paris.</p>

                        <p>The new French High Commissioner, Jouvenel, arrived day before yesterday
                            and today he waited upon the Legislative Assembly of the Greater
                            Lebanon. It is his policy to offer peace to those who are peaceful but a
                            fight to the finish to those who want war.</p>
                        <p>Jouvenel grants to the Legislative Assembly the right to draw up an
                            organic law for the Greater Lebanon. He intimates that if the interior
                            regions lay down their arms he will extend the same right to them.</p>
                        <p>Lebanese aspirations should be satisfied by Jouvenel’s declaration. This
                            together with the fact that the menace of Druse invasion of the Lebanon
                            has been relieved by the arrival of reenforcements during the past 3
                            weeks should assure public safety in the coast regions and make it
                            unnecessary to keep destroyers here to protect Americans in this
                            region.</p>
                        <p>Very likely there will be no cessation of guerrilla warfare in the
                            interior [but it is not probable?] that the coast will be disturbed. I
                            recommend, therefore, that the destroyers be withdrawn at once so as to
                            strengthen further the position of the new High Commissioner and help me
                            in my relations with him. Sent to Paris Embassy and to the
                            Department.</p>

                            No. 4502 of October 17, 1924, inviting attention to Article 44 of the
                            French Law of March 22, 1924, which states that the reductions in taxes

                        <p>The Treaty of 1800 with France is no longer in force, having expired by
                            its own limitations on July 31, 1809. (Malloy <hi rend="italic"

                            on the matter under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Attention may, however, be invited to the fact that under the Revenue Act

                            as American citizens. The Act furthermore allows credits in the payment
                            of income taxes to married persons and the heads of families, and for
                            minor children and other dependents. These credits are allowed resident

                            instruction No. 1190 of November 10th last, which directed me to express
                            to the French Government the hope that American citizens residing in
                            France would be assessed income taxes at the same rate as citizens of
                            France, and that those who are married or are the heads of families or

                            citizens under similar circumstances, I have the honor to report that I
                            have received a note from the Foreign Office, dated December 30th, to
                            the effect that the above-mentioned request cannot be granted, as, in
                            the absence of conventional agreements, citizens of one country living
                            in the other must submit to the laws relative to their position. I am

                            have to pay higher income taxes than French citizens, and request the

                            which you ask whether the Department desires you to follow up the
                            intimation made by the French Foreign Office that a convention on this
                            subject might be entered into by the two Governments.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 5318 of
                            June 22nd last, and to previous correspondence with regard to the desire
                            of the Department that the French Government should grant reciprocal
                            income tax exemptions to American citizens living in France, I take
                            pleasure in reporting that I have been able to secure a satisfactory
                            settlement of this question.</p>
                        <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0214"/>
                        <p>While the Department stated in its instruction No. 1190 of November 10,
                            1924, that “there appears to be no treaty provision in force between the
                            two countries at the present time bearing on the matter under
                            consideration,” and while the Foreign Office, in a note enclosed with my
                            despatch No. 4737 of January 7th last, refused to grant reciprocal
                            exemptions on the ground that no convention existed regulating this
                            question, I deemed it worth while to point out to the Foreign Office
                            that a broad construction of the Consular Convention between France and
                            the United States of 1853<note n="22" xml:id="d119fn22">Malloy, <hi

                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 528.</note> might be held to cover
                            the point at issue. I pointed out, furthermore, in a personal interview,
                            that, since French citizens in the United States receive the same
                            exemptions as regards family charges, etc., that American citizens
                            receive under our income tax law, reciprocity would, in fact, exist if
                            the construction I desired were given the above-mentioned Consular
                            Convention. I urged that this construction be adopted in order to put an
                            end to the many American complaints regarding a lack of fairness in this
                            matter and because of the good effect that such equitable action would
                            have on American opinion.</p>
                        <p>I have to-day received a note, a copy and translation of which I am
                            enclosing herewith, to the effect that, as a result of Article VII of
                            the Consular Convention of 1853, American citizens in France and French
                            citizens in the United States are assimilated to nationals of the
                            country in which they live as regards the payment of or exemptions from
                            taxes.</p>

                                    and Mr. Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer, had a friendly

                                    particular point outstanding between Great Britain and the
                                    United States.</p>
                                <p>While no decision could be reached on actual details, there was a
                                    general agreement that the matter should be further explored
                                    with good hopes of reaching a solution equitable to Great
                                    Britain, the United States and all the other parties concerned.
                                    The prospects of an early settlement must therefore be
                                    considered favorable.</p>

                        <p>21. L–304 from Logan. Churchill disclosed in conversation last night that
                            he is willing to recommend a settlement on the basis of 55,000,000 gold
                            marks cash priority per annum to commence September 1, 1926, on our Army
                            costs account, plus 2 percent, or approximately 40,000,000 marks minimum
                            in normal year, participation in <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0218"
                            />“reparations account”. This offer privately made was in nature of
                            compromise. The formal British offer remains 50,000,000 cash priority
                            plus 2 percent on claims. He declined to go any further on a compromise
                            but agreed to submit any proposals to Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>I made the following alternative proposals, all, of course, subject to
                            the Department’s approval: (1) 55,000,000 gold marks cash priority, and
                            2¼ percent on “reparations”, that is, 45,000,000 in normal year; (2)
                            60,000,000 cash priority, and 2 percent, or 40,000,000 gold marks; and
                            (3) 50,000,000 cash priority and 2½ percent, or 50,000,000 on
                            “reparations”. That is to say, I stood on the basis of 100,000,000 in a
                            normal year, with, however, Army costs starting September 1, 1926, and
                            “reparation” starting September 1, 1924.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that all that separates the British from our tentative
                            proposals is 5,000,000 gold marks.</p>
                        <p>It is probable that under these proposals we would be forced to waive
                            interest on Army costs arrears. We are inclined to feel that offer made
                            by Churchill is about as far as we can get him to go, though we may be
                            able to obtain advance to 100,000,000 basis. If impossible to do better
                            may we settle on either the 95 or the preferable 100 basis? Logan.</p>

                        <p>17. L–189 for Logan. Your L–304, January 9, noon. The Department has
                            noted that you have indicated a willingness to accept the minimum of
                            100,000,000 gold marks, but that Army costs would commence on September
                            1, 1926, and that other payments would commence on September 1, 1924. In
                            view of the willingness of this Government to postpone payments for past
                            Army costs, notwithstanding that other Governments have been
                            substantially paid, and in view of the further postponement of Army cost
                            priorities to September 1, 1926, because of the provisions of the Dawes
                            Plan in regard to expenditure of payments in these years within Germany,
                            the Department believes that you should insist on the minimum of
                            100,000,000 gold marks in normal year, of which 50,000,000 at least and
                            preferably more would consist of priority payments on Army costs.</p>
                        <p>If percentage is accepted for other claims, then priorities should be so
                            defined as to yield to this Government the estimated minimum, or, if
                            possible, a flat sum should be stipulated.</p>
                        <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0219"/>
                        <p>It appears to us to be inequitable, considering the delay in
                            reimbursement of Army costs, that interest on arrears should be waived.
                            This matter should not, however, present great practical difficulty, as
                            it is difficult to believe that the relatively small payments necessary
                            to cover amount due us will not in fact be made.</p>
                        <p>Of course, it is understood, as pointed out in your memorandum to
                                Leith-Ross,<note n="13" xml:id="d124fn13"><ref

                            are to be credited to capital amount of our Army costs claims.</p>

                            Churchill’s willingness to settle on basis of 55,000,000 gold marks cash
                            priority to commence September 1, 1926, for our Army costs account, you

                            participation in “reparations account” that will yield minimum of
                            45,000,000 gold marks, making a minimum total of 100,000,000 gold marks

                        <p>28. L–307 [from Herrick, Kellogg, Logan]. We have just finished
                            conferences with Churchill. We called on Churchill this afternoon for
                            the purpose of discussing claims position. We finally agreed on
                            following tentative proposal: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is recommend[ed] that the United States Government should
                                    receive: (1) 55,000,000 gold marks cash priority for 17½ years
                                    [commencing?] September 1, 1926; (2) two and a fourth [percent?]
                                    of reparation yield of Dawes annuities from September 1, 1924,
                                    provided that the annuity resulting from this percentage shall
                                    not in any year exceed 45[,000,000] gold marks. Subject to
                                    above, the United States Government (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                                    to waive any claim under the existing Wadsworth Agreement on the

                                    at the Federal Reserve Bank, New York, which sum would be
                                    immediately released to the United States Treasury, and (<hi

                        <p rend="center">[Paraphrase]</p>
                        <p>On the basis of the foregoing Churchill stated that he was prepared to
                            settle. We said that we should have to have the Department’s approval.
                            We feel that this is all that we can get; acceptance of this proposal
                            will probably prevent discussion in the Conference.</p>
                        <p>Will Department verify balance “62,500,000 gold marks” said to be on
                            deposit in Federal Reserve Bank in blocked account to our credit? It is
                            Logan’s impression that a larger sum is now on deposit there and that
                            arrangement can readily be effected to have it included in the figure
                            mentioned in the proposal. Please reply as soon as possible. Herrick,

                        <p>I see no reason why anyone but Logan need sign the agreement. All the
                            details will probably be arranged and will finally be agreed upon
                            tonight. Signing may be delayed by reason of the smaller powers desiring
                            to examine the instrument. Is there any reason why I should wait after
                            the matter is fully settled? Herrick agrees with me.</p>

                            a.m. The reference to the limitation of our claims to $350,000,000
                            raises the serious question of whether treaty rights are modified,
                            because the exact amount of these claims is not ascertainable until the
                            adjudication which is not yet completed, and also through the possible
                            waiver of interest. An agreement so limited as to amount would have to
                            be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. If limitation were
                            omitted submission would probably be unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>Please endeavor immediately to eliminate the limitation, which as drafted
                            appears to be unnecessary. You will recall that the $350,000,000 is only
                            an estimate of the probable total awards.</p>
                        <p>The Department will furnish you with instructions on other points at the
                            earliest possible moment.</p>

                            than Germany applies only to waiver of participation in respect of army

                            negotiated with Austria and Hungary for settlement of claims, and the
                            United States necessarily looks to these governments for reimbursement

                        <p>(1) If there is nothing in the agreement constituting a modification of
                            our treaty rights Department believes agreement can be given effect
                            merely by Executive approval. But if agreement is drawn in same form as
                            Finance Ministers’ agreement of March 1922 we would not (repeat not)
                            presumably be precluded by the terms of the agreement from seeking
                            Senate approval, if necessary. If other signatories desire usual clause
                            respecting ratification, wording of Wadsworth Agreement should be
                            used.</p>

                            well constitute a modification of our treaty rights. If limitation can
                            not be eliminated, Department would probably find that agreement should
                            be submitted to the Senate.</p>
                        <p>(3) [Paraphrase.] The Department believes that it is preferable to have
                            one agreement, not only for reasons you outline in your paragraph 3, but
                            also because our particpation would be assured when major agreement in
                            which the Allies are interested becomes effective. [End paraphrase.]
                            Since, however, many of the subjects discussed do not directly concern
                            the United States, you should on signing make the following declaration
                            to be recorded in the agreement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In signing the present agreement the representatives of the

                                    States nor as passing upon questions that do not concern
                                    American participation in the sums distributed pursuant to the
                                    agreement.”</p>

                            while we were signing. After talking very confidentially with one or two
                            members, we fear to make a fight in the open conference because of the
                            fear that others would begin to attach reservations with possible
                            disastrous consequences. There is no commitment on our part as to
                            obligations of other governments. Commitments between Allied Governments
                            specifically state their being “between Allied Governments.” Where we
                            are concerned specific reference is made “United States of America.” For
                            foregoing reasons and as our position amply protected we have signed
                            without reservation of any kind whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>If you desire we can file a letter with Secretariat General as part of
                            the minutes of conference making the foregoing points clear but we think
                            it inadvisable to do so.</p>

                            <p>C) As from the date at which Belgian priority is extinguished or at
                                the latest from 1st September 1926, the 3½% released by the above
                                arrangements for the repayment of the Belgian priority will be
                                payable to France and Great Britain in the proportion 52:22, in
                                addition to their Spa percentages.</p>
                            <p>The sums debited to Belgium in respect of the period to 1st September
                                1924, will not be regarded as creating for her either excess
                                payments or arrears, provided that this shall be without prejudice
                                to the liability of Belgium to account for any final balance under
                                the Economic Clauses of the Treaty.</p>
                            <p>D) The right accruing to Belgium as a result of previous Agreements
                                on payments received or to be received from or on account of
                                Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria remain unaltered.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In conversation on February 2nd, His
                                Excellency the United States Ambassador drew my attention to the
                                interest of the Standard Oil Company in certain tank steamers of the
                                Deutsche Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft, which had been handed
                                over by the German Government to the Reparation Commission in
                                execution of the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>I understand the essential facts of this question to be as
                                    follows. The point originally at issue was whether or not the
                                    tank steamers in question were properly deliverable by Germany
                                    under the provisions of Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles.
                                    It was claimed by the Standard Oil Company that the vessels were
                                    in effect their property and not deliverable. The case was one
                                    which it was within the power of the Reparation Commission to
                                    decide judicially and such a decision would be valid against all
                                    parties. Out of consideration for the United States Government
                                    the Reparation Commission refrained from proceeding to such a
                                    decision but consented to an arrangement, embodied in an
                                    agreement with the United States Government signed <pb n="167"

                                    representing the Reparation Commission and the other the United
                                    States Government, with the provision that a third disinterested
                                    person should be nominated to join the Tribunal in the event of
                                    the disagreement between its original members. If the third
                                    arbitrator were called in, the decision of the majority of the
                                    Tribunal was to be final. On June 28th, 1924, the two

                                    7th, 1920, they suggested to the Reparation Commission a
                                    compromise which in outline was that the vessels should be sold
                                    and the proceeds divided equally between the Deutsche
                                    Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft and the Reparation

                                    honour to inform you that in a matter in which the Reparation
                                    Commission acts in a judicial capacity His Majesty’s Government
                                    have not the power and would not consider it proper to give any
                                    instructions to the British member of the Commission. But apart
                                    from this question of principle involved, the view of His
                                    Majesty’s Government is that the Reparation Commission would not
                                    be justified in now agreeing to the suggested compromise. This
                                    could, in fact, only be accepted by an agreement between all the
                                    interested parties who comprise not only the Reparation
                                    Commission, as generally representing the Powers entitled to

                                    the German Government, whose interests are affected, and the
                                    British Government, which under the existing interallied
                                    arrangement is entitled to the tankers themselves if they are

                                <item>There is indeed grave objection in principle to departing from
                                    the arbitral procedure formally agreed upon which in itself
                                    constituted a compromise assented to as an act of courtesy to
                                    the United States Government. Procedure by arbitration is likely
                                    to prove a matter of great practical importance on numerous
                                    occasions arising-out of the Dawes plan and of interallied
                                    agreements; and if in such cases agreed procedure is to be

                                <item>His Majesty’s Government trust that the United States
                                    Government will recognise the force of these considerations and
                                    will allow the arbitration now to take its course. No excessive
                                    delay need be anticipated and, as the case has already occupied
                                    several years, no serious inconvenience can reasonably be held
                                    to be involved by a further short delay in order to obtain the
                                    independent and impartial judicial decision which the parties
                                    have engaged themselves to accept.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I am in receipt of your letter of June 3,
                                1925,<note n="50" xml:id="d144fn50">Not printed.</note> in regard to
                            the Ex-D. A. P. G. Tankers. You state that the arbitration in this case
                            was held under the arbitral agreement as amended, made at Paris by the
                            Reparation Commission and the United States Government represented by
                            Mr. Boyden, that when the case was submitted to the arbitrators the
                            Standard Oil Company was represented by Mr. Montagu Piesse, who had been
                            thoroughly in touch with the discussions leading up to the Tanker
                            Agreement, and that the immediate question which you desire to have the
                            Department consider is whether or not the United States Government shall
                            be represented by counsel on the proposed submission of the Tanker case
                            to the arbitrators when the third arbitrator is called in because of the
                            disagreement of the two arbitrators who have heard the case.</p>
                        <p>This case was not referred to arbitration through a direct formal
                            agreement between the United States and another foreign power, nor did
                            the United States designate counsel to conduct the case before the
                            arbitrators. The Department does not consider that it would be
                            appropriate for it to designate counsel at this stage of the proceedings
                            to serve with counsel for the Standard Oil Company in presenting the
                            case to the tribunal constituted under the arbitral agreement when the
                            third arbitrator is called in because of the disagreement of the two
                            arbitrators before whom the case has been argued. It may be observed in
                            this connection that in view of the apparent disagreement of the two
                            arbitrators on the question whether the Standard Oil Company has failed
                            to make good its claim to beneficial ownership of the tankers, it would
                            seem that the decision will, in effect, rest with the third arbitrator
                            upon a consideration of the facts and arguments already presented to the
                            two arbitrators by counsel for the Reparation Commission and by counsel
                            for the Standard Oil Company, and that no material advantage would in
                            any event be derived from having counsel designated by the United States
                            take up the case <hi rend="italic">de novo.</hi></p>

                            Sjoeborg will be in a position to serve as the third arbitrator. Mr.
                            Hill added that he would see that the Department and your company are
                            consulted in regard to the selection of the third arbitrator in the
                            event that Mr. Sjoeborg cannot serve.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the inquiry contained in your letter under
                            acknowledgment as to whether the arbitrators have filed their respective
                            formal decisions in this case, it may be stated that the Department
                            appears to have received no definite information as to what action the
                            arbitrators may have taken after it became apparent that the case would
                            probably be referred to the third arbitrator. However, Mr. Hill has been
                            requested to submit a report on this point and upon the receipt of his
                            reply the Department will communicate with you again.</p>

                            The Department desires that you perform such duties in this case as were
                            performed by Mr. Logan as American Observer. It is understood that these
                            duties were in the main as follows:—Since the case of the Standard Oil
                            Company was nominally presented on behalf of the United States it was
                            understood that the American Observer had authority to place before the
                            arbitrators any briefs or documents prepared by counsel for the Standard
                            Oil Company in support of the contentions of the Company, and that the
                            American Observer was authorized to act as the spokesman of this
                            Government in any communications regarding the case which he was
                            authorized by the Department to submit to the Reparation Commission.</p>
                        <p>The American Observer also had authority from the Department to confer
                            freely with the American arbitrator concerning the progress of the case
                            and was encouraged to submit full reports to the Department in regard to
                            developments in connection with the arbitration. You are authorized to
                            take similar action.</p>
                        <p>The Department considers that you should avoid becoming interested in the
                            case to such an extent as may give rise to the assumption that you are
                            in effect acting as counsel for this Government in the presentation of
                            the case. However, in view of your familiarity with the Department’s
                            attitude in this matter and your knowledge of the extent to which the
                            Department has assisted the Standard Oil Company in its efforts to have
                            the case fully presented to the Arbitral Tribunal, you may, in addition
                            to your duties in the case as Acting American Observer, render to
                            counsel for the Standard Oil Company such assistance as may be possible
                            and proper with a view to having the company accorded a full opportunity
                            to present its case to the arbitrators.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Hill</hi>: The Department has received
                            your letter of August 25, 1925, in further relation to the D. A. P. G.
                            Tanker case.<note n="52" xml:id="d146fn52">Not printed.</note> It
                            concurs with you in your opinion that Mr. Sjoeborg must be considered,
                            in view of the wording of paragraph 3 of Decision 1577 of October 14
                                [<hi rend="italic">13?</hi>], 1921, of the Reparation Commission,
                            quoted in your letter under acknowledgment, as a member of the Tribunal,
                            rather than as an umpire—and that the interested parties should be
                            permitted, after the third member has joined the Tribunal, to file
                            additional <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0254"/>briefs and present
                            oral arguments before the Tribunal thus reconstituted. The Department
                            perceives no objection to your addressing a joint communication to the
                            three arbitrators, requesting that an opportunity be given to the
                            Standard Oil Company to submit, if it so desires, additional briefs or
                            to present oral arguments to the Tribunal as now constituted.</p>
                        <p>As you accurately state, it is obvious that the arbitrators are vested
                            with authority to construe paragraph 20 of Annex II of Part VIII of the
                            Treaty of Versailles, and that their decision in the matter is
                            apparently binding. In view of this fact, the Department does not deem
                            it necessary at this time to determine the scope of the paragraph in
                            question.</p>
                        <p>The Department does not consider, however, that it should undertake to
                            advise the Standard Oil Company in regard to the competence of any
                            attorney it may decide to retain to represent its interest in this
                            matter. While the Department desires you to lend the Standard Oil
                            Company every proper assistance in order that it may he assured a fair
                            hearing in this controversy, and perceives no objection to your action
                            in informally drawing the attention of Colonel Bayne and of the Standard
                            Oil Company’s representative to pertinent decisions and agreements which
                            may have a bearing on the case, it considers, however, that the
                            responsibility for the actual prosecution of the case must rest with the
                            Standard Oil Company. The Department’s refusal to appoint an attorney to
                            take part in the proceedings in this case clearly indicates that it does
                            not wish to assume any responsibility for the actual presentation of
                            this case before the Tribunal. In view of the foregoing considerations,
                            the Department does not deem it advisable to make any suggestions to the
                            Standard Oil Company concerning the employment of additional counsel by
                            that company.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with previous reports from
                            this Embassy concerning the placing of American loans in Germany, I have
                            the honor <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0255"/>to call particular
                            attention to the Department’s telegram No. 170, dated September 2, 6
                                p.m.<note n="54" xml:id="d147fn54">The telegram reads as follows:
                                “Press September 2 reports that German Government has adopted policy
                                that municipalities will not contract any more individual loans but
                                will unite to seek consolidated loans to be apportioned as required.
                                Telegraph brief report and mail details.”</note></p>
                        <p>As set out in my telegram No. 156, dated September 5, 5 p.m.,<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d147fn55">Not printed.</note> the German authorities have
                            stated that the German Government is opposed to the indiscriminate
                            contraction of loans by German municipalities, but that otherwise the
                            press report of September 2 was incorrect. I added, for the Department’s
                            confidential information, that a group of municipalities, advocating the
                            policy indicated, had approached the representatives of the National
                            City Bank here in an endeavor to secure loans, but that the bank had
                            refused to consider their proposition.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this matter with a number of the higher German officials
                            and many of the leading industrialists and financiers, (see my despatch
                            No. 147, of August 6, 1925),<note n="55" xml:id="d147fn58">Not
                                printed.</note> and their opinion, without exception, has been that,
                            if American capitalists continue granting considerable loans to German
                            municipalities, the result will be disastrous for the future of German
                            Economy and will eventually lead to interference, on the part of the
                            Transfer Committee, with the Transfer out of Germany of the interest
                            charges involved. The Government has attempted to put a curb on the
                            borrowings; but, on account of a lack of a dependable majority in the
                            Reichstag, the German Cabinet must play more than the usual amount of
                            politics and is not always able to take a firm stand under the
                            provisions of the law which requires that municipalities must receive
                            the previous authorization of the Government before contracting loans
                            (An additional step in this direction has recently been taken by the
                            Prussian Government: See my despatch No. 251 of September 4<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d147fn59">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>It is fully realized by German business men that, if reparations are to
                            be paid and interest charges on loans now being contracted are to be
                            met, it is necessary to take steps, without more delay, to bring about a
                            change in the status of Germany’s balance of trade. To do this, it is
                            obviously necessary to build up German agriculture and German industry;
                            and it is extremely difficult to build them up at this juncture on
                            account of high interest rates prevailing as a result of a lack of
                            liquid capital (not to mention other well-known difficulties, growing
                            out of the application of the Treaty of Versailles, so frequently
                            described in the international press by Germans and German partisans).
                            With this in mind, these men of business say that the only thing that
                            can save them is the ability to borrow abroad (and abroad, <pb n="174"
                                xml:id="pg_174" facs="0256"/>of course, means America). They feel
                            that they, and not the greedy municipalities, should have first call on
                            all money loaned to Germany.</p>
                        <p>I take it for granted that American concerns which lend money here desire
                            to be eventually repaid, and for this reason I am taking special
                            occasion to ask consideration of the whole question. There are two
                            points of view about lending money to Germany. One is that German
                            industry, commerce, agriculture and finance are in a hopeless condition;
                            reparations will never be paid; money loaned to Germany is thrown away.
                            The second is this: it is a fact that economic conditions in Germany are
                            not good at present, but they can be improved by letting Germany have
                            enough money in the shape of loans to enable her to get back on her feet
                            again. Once she is back on her feet again economically, she will find
                            the necessary markets for her exports and be able to pay reparations and
                            repay the money she has borrowed. The recent loan made by the National
                            City Bank to the Rentenbank, for agricultural purposes, is a case in
                            point. (See my telegram No. 159, dated September 14, 3 p.m.<note n="57"
                                xml:id="d147fn57">Not printed.</note>)</p>
                        <p>It does seem clear that the first essential is for agriculture, and,
                            after agriculture, industry, to be given a chance; and they will get the
                            chance if they are able to borrow moderate sums abroad; but it is
                            essential to bear in mind that they should not be permitted to borrow
                            more than they can repay, and each application should certainly be
                            scrutinized most carefully as to its merits.</p>
                        <p>With these factors in mind, I believe that the demands of the
                            municipalities should be relegated to the background; and I have come to
                            the conclusion that we can do no better service to Germany and to
                            ourselves than to discourage the further placing of German municipal
                            loans in America.</p>

                            honor to transmit herewith an original copy of a pamphlet recently
                            prepared by the Transfer Committee and entitled: “The American Loan of
                            the Rentenbank Credit Institution and the Negotiations of the
                            Girozentrale”, and to refer to the second section of that document. <pb
                                n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0257"/>As is therein set out, it is no
                            secret that the Girozentrale, which is the Bank of the Deutscher
                            Sparkassen und Giroverband, has been in negotiations with the National
                            City Bank for some months past with a view to floating a loan in
                            America, the proceeds of which would be apportioned among certain
                            Communes in Germany. According to the press, the National City Bank had
                            expressed its readiness in principle to place this loan, but, before
                            doing so, was anxious to know what the attitude of the American market
                            would be to the loan of the Credit Institution of the Rentenbank.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, I desire to ask attention to press reports here, which
                            describe the successful floating in New York of a recent loan of about
                            ten million dollars to the City of Bremen and which, according to the
                            evening edition of the <hi rend="italic">Boersen Courier</hi> of
                            September 23rd, was oversubscribed. The same journal contained the
                            following statement in connection with the placing of further loans to
                            the United States: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“In view of the success of the Bremen loan in
                                    New York, it is probable that a Bavarian State loan of about 25
                                    million dollars will be floated. It is said that a syndicate
                                    composed of the Guaranty Trust Company, et al., will offer this
                                    loan on about October 1, 1925. It is further stated that an
                                    American banking group will arrange a loan of five million
                                    dollars for the city of Posen (now Poland).”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>With the situation as described in my confidential despatch No. 295,
                            dated September 15, 1925, in mind, I have the honor again respectfully
                            to emphasize the inherent dangers of this policy, and again to point out
                            that American financiers are running risks that do not seem to me to be
                            justified, in advancing these large amounts to German municipalities. I
                            am told that the reason why the bankers are ready to handle municipal
                            and state loans is that these bonds find a more receptive market in the
                            United States than do bonds of industrial or commercial concerns. The
                            reason for this lies in the fact that the muncipalities and states, in
                            most instances, can advertise the fact that, as a result of inflation,
                            they have wiped out practically all, or nearly all, of their
                            indebtedness. (They, of course, do not mention that this was a species
                            of repudiation).</p>
                        <p>While I realize that the factor just mentioned would unquestionably add
                            to the attractiveness of an issue, I still believe that the other
                            factors involved (those set out with my despatch No. 295), are of much
                            more serious import, and therefore I desire again to go on record as
                            discountenancing the granting of loans by American capitalists to German
                            Communes and Communal associations.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my confidential despatches
                            Nos. 295, of September 15, and 329, of September 23, 1925, on the Credit
                            Question, I have the honor to say that I desire again to go on record as
                            issuing a warning on the present policy of American financiers in
                            lending money in Germany. The <hi rend="italic">Vossische Zeitung</hi>
                            of this morning states that the Bavarian loan was oversubscribed shortly
                            after it was offered on the New York Stock Exchange. This loan, of
                            course, belonged to the class that is being so roundly denounced by
                            leading Germans.</p>
                        <p>This whole question was recently fully discussed at the Bankers’ Annual
                            Congress, where the opinion was expressed, on all sides, that “foreign
                            loans should be avoided as far as possible and should be contracted only
                            when they will speedily and directly increase national production, and,
                            in particular, increase the production of goods that are sure of an
                            export market, so enabling interest and principal to be paid.”</p>
                        <p>It is a commentary upon present conditions that representatives of
                            American financial interests here in Berlin have actually been competing
                            against each other in an effort to get some of the loans recently
                            contracted.</p>

                                general for reparation payments.</note> for your information. I have
                            been receiving repeated inquiries within the past few days from
                            representatives of American banking houses as to the attitude of the
                            Transfer Committee toward service of the German loans floated in the
                            United States. Practically all these inquiries have duplicated inquiries
                            on the same point which were made nearly a year ago and one banker has
                            said that occasion for renewed inquiry was that the Department of State
                            had advised his New York office to make such inquiries of the agent
                            general for reparation payments. He said further that State Department
                            has included advice to this effect in its formal <pb n="177"
                                xml:id="pg_177" facs="0259"/>letters to bankers indicating
                            Department’s attitude toward several recent German loans. If the
                            Department is in fact giving this advice to bankers I should very much
                            appreciate sample testimonial by cable. Our consistent answer to all
                            such inquiries from the beginning of operations under the experts’
                                plan<note n="60" xml:id="d150fn60">The Reparation Commission, <hi

                            reparation payments. There has been no change in the situation so far as
                            the Transfer Committee is concerned and its attitude in the matter
                            remains unchanged.</p>

                                    commercial credits has been extended to German interests during
                                    the past year.</p>
                                <p>“In these circumstances the Department believes that American
                                    bankers should examine with particular care all German financing
                                    that is brought to their attention, with a view to ascertaining
                                    whether the loan proceeds are to be used for productive and
                                    self-supporting objects that will improve, directly or
                                    indirectly, the economic condition of Germany and tend to aid
                                    that country in meeting its financial obligations at home and
                                    abroad. In this connection I feel that I should inform you that
                                    the Department is advised that the German Federal authorities
                                    themselves are not disposed to view with favor the <pb n="178"
                                        xml:id="pg_178" facs="0260"/>indiscriminate placing of
                                    German loans in the American market, particularly when the
                                    borrowers are German municipalities and the purposes are not
                                    productive.</p>
                                <p>“Moreover it cannot be said at this time that serious
                                    complications in connection with interest and amortization
                                    payments by German borrowers may not arise from possible future
                                    action by the Agent General and the Transfer Committee. While
                                    the Department of State does not wish to be understood as
                                    passing upon the interpretation or application of the provisions
                                    of the Dawes Plan, or upon their effect, if any, upon loans such
                                    as the one now under consideration by you, it desires to point
                                    out that there is no clear indication of what the attitude of
                                    the Agent General and the Transfer Committee would be towards
                                    such loans in the event of a scarcity of available foreign
                                    exchange embarrassing their operations in effecting the
                                    transfers necessary to the execution of the Dawes Plan. It seems
                                    to the Department, therefore, that before issuing such loans you
                                    should inform yourselves whether the Transfer Committee will
                                    place any priorities or obstacles in the way of transferring
                                    funds for the payment of principal and interest and that you
                                    should make clear to your clients the full situation.</p>
                                <p>“These risks, which obviously concern the investing public,
                                    should in the opinion of the Department be cleared up by you
                                    before any action is taken. If they cannot be definitely
                                    eliminated, the Department believes that you should consider
                                    whether you do not owe a duty to your prospective clients fully
                                    to advise them of the situation.</p>
                                <p>“While the foregoing considerations involve questions of business
                                    risk, and while the Department does not in any case pass upon
                                    the merits of foreign loans as business propositions, it is
                                    unwilling, in view of the uncertainties of the situation, to
                                    allow the matter to pass without calling the foregoing
                                    considerations to your attention. In reply to your inquiry,
                                    however, I beg to state that there appear to be no questions of
                                    government policy involved which would justify the Department in
                                    offering objection to the loan in question.”</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that a
                            conference on the general financial situation in Germany took place at
                            the Commonwealth Ministry of Finance in Berlin, on the 20th instant,
                            between the representatives of the various state governments,
                            municipalities and other governmental organizations. It is stated that
                            the Commonwealth Minister of Finance urged the states and municipalities
                            to observe the <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0261"/>greatest
                            economy, and that the Vice President of the Reichsbank supported the
                            policy of Dr. Schacht, President of the Reichsbank (now in the United
                            States), by opposing the constantly increasing demands of municipalities
                            for foreign loans.</p>
                        <p>The following communiqué was issued by the Commonwealth Ministry of
                            Finance after the termination of the Conference: <quote

                                <p>“The Advisory Board for foreign credits, which has been formed at
                                    the Ministry of Finance and which must pass upon the foreign
                                    credits of the communes, points out that thus far loans have
                                    been issued in the United States of America with the consent of
                                    the Advisory Board only to the cities of Berlin, Cologne and
                                    Munich. Lately, various applications of other communes have been
                                    submitted to the Advisory Board by the competent State
                                    Governments. The Advisory Board will, however, examine every
                                    case as to the absolute necessity and usefulness of such loans.
                                    The Advisory Board takes the attitude that only in very
                                    exceptional cases will it be possible to prove the productivity
                                    of foreign loans sought by cities, and it is of the opinion
                                    that, in all cases where this is not possible, foreign credits
                                    should not be granted to German cities, because of
                                    considerations for the protection of the German currency. The
                                    curtailment of funds available for German economy by loans made
                                    to cities must also be prevented, for it seems much more urgent
                                    to provide industry and agriculture with foreign credits, so far
                                    as they can be utilized to favor exports or indirectly to
                                    diminish imports, than to make funds available to communes for
                                    purposes which, though valuable as such, may be set aside for a
                                    later time.”</p>

                        <p>This unfavorable attitude of the Advisory Board toward foreign loans to
                            German municipalities because of doubt as to the productivity of such
                            loans, and out of consideration for the protection of the German
                            currency, is especially interesting in connection with the Department’s
                            telegram No. 184 of October 17, 7 p.m., quoting the reply which the
                            Department is making to American bankers who consult it regarding the

                                character. The communiqué quoted states that loans to Berlin,
                                Cologne, and Munich were the only ones approved. In addition to
                                these loans, however, there have been floated in this country loans

                                <p>“The Transfer Committee has consistently told American bankers
                                    from the beginning of operations under the Dawes Plan that it
                                    was not in a position to give assurances concerning the payment
                                    of interest or amortization on German loans that might be
                                    floated abroad. This position has not changed. American bankers
                                    who have inquired have been referred to the experts’ plan and
                                    the London Agreement for a statement of the powers and
                                    responsibilities of the Transfer Committee and I believe that
                                    American bankers interested in German loans fully understand the

                        <p>For reasons explained in my despatch 295, September 15, very effective
                            control cannot be exerted by Advisory Board over loans to
                            municipalities. It is stated by the Acting Chief of the Advisory Board
                            that it would be necessary to amend the constitution in order to make
                            control by the board effective, as the various states can at any time
                            withdraw their consent to be represented on the board. It is not my
                            impression as matters now stand that the Advisory Board or any other

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The situation with respect
                            to the general subject of German loans seems to be as follows:</p>
                        <p>Prior to October 9th, it was the practice of the Department to suggest
                            that American bankers assure themselves that the financing in question
                            would increase the productivity of Germany, and to call their attention
                            to the provisions of the Dawes Plan, and, when necessary, to the
                            provisions of Article 248 of the Treaty of Versailles. Subject to the
                            foregoing, and in the light of the information at hand, the Department
                            then stated that it offered no objection to the financing in question.
                            The Department also used the customary formula in pointing out that it
                            did not pass upon business risks or assume any responsibility.</p>
                        <p>From October 9th, the Department has been using the new formula<note
                                n="71" xml:id="d159fn71">See telegram No. 184, Oct. 17, 7 p.m., to
                                the Ambassador in Germany, <ref target="#pg_177">p.
                                177</ref>.</note> which brought about objections on the part of the
                            bankers, and a revision of which is now under consideration.</p>
                        <p>You will recall the statements made by Dr. Schacht and the claim that a
                            new situation has been brought about by a change in the policy of the
                            German Government. However, after repeated inquiries by cable to the
                            American Embassy at Berlin, the most that <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184"
                                facs="0266"/>can be said is that about October 21st a public
                            announcement was made by the Advisory Board that it would take a stiffer
                            attitude with regard to municipal, commune, and state financing, and,
                            according to our information, the Board has done no more than to reduce
                            somewhat the amount of proposed municipal and state financing.</p>
                        <p>Recently, Mr. Gilbert made public a statement of the attitude of the
                            Agent General and the Transfer Committee with regard to the question of
                            transfers.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing, it will be seen that there has been little, if any,
                            actual change in the situation since October 9th which in itself would
                            justify us in modifying the formula which has been used since that
                            date.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with your instructions I have discussed the matter
                            informally with Mr. Winston,<note n="72" xml:id="d159fn72">Garrard B.
                                Winston, Under Secretary of the Treasury.</note> and I gather that
                            as a matter of policy he does not wish to prevent German financing but
                            merely, in stating that there is no question of Government policy
                            involved which would justify us in making objection, to call the
                            attention of the bankers to the question of productivity, difficulty of
                            transfer, and, when necessary, Article 248. I attach a rough draft of a
                            formula which he has sent me.<note n="73" xml:id="d159fn73">Not found in
                                Department files.</note></p>
                        <p>I have not yet ascertained what position Mr. Hoover is likely to take
                            since the receipt of the last report from Mr. Schurman, a copy of which
                            was sent to him.</p>
                        <p>So far as I can see, the reasons which led the Department to adopt the
                            formula of October 9th and since that time, have not been modified in
                            any substantial degree. It would not appear to be wise, therefore, to
                            depart in any great measure from the position taken in the formula of
                            October 9th except as to the change in the situation brought about by
                            Mr. Gilbert’s public statement.</p>
                        <p>I beg, therefore, to submit a revised formula for your approval.<note

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have examined with
                            considerable care the proposed letter to be sent out to bankers
                            suggested by Mr. Winston <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0267"/>with
                            some changes suggested by Mr. Hoover.<note n="75" xml:id="d160fn75">Not
                                found in Department files.</note> It seems to me that, having
                            deliberately adopted the form of letter which has been sent to all the
                            bankers, we ought not to depart from it any more than is made necessary
                            by changed conditions, because I am sure the matter is bound to come up
                            in Congress and that we would then be asked why we had entirely changed
                            the form of our letter.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing a copy of the original form of letter which we have been
                            sending out, in which the proposed changes and additions are underscored
                            and the omissions put in brackets.<note n="76" xml:id="d160fn76">Marked
                                copy not found in Department files.</note></p>
                        <p>There is one change which I think we could consistently make, i. e. to
                            omit the part of the letter in brackets on pages three and four which
                            indicates that the bankers should satisfy themselves as to the attitude
                            of the Transfer Committee and inform their clients of the situation.
                            They have inquired of the Transfer Committee and Mr. Gilbert has made a
                            public statement to the effect that the Committee is not in a position
                            to give any assurance concerning the payment of interest or amortization
                            of German loans floated abroad. I am sorry to say that this statement
                            has not received the publicity and attracted the attention that it
                            should have, and therefore I think we ought to call attention in the
                            letter to just what he said. This puts the bankers on notice. I am
                            willing therefore to omit the part of the letter in brackets if you feel
                            as though, on account of their inquiries from Gilbert, we should not
                            continue to send this portion of the letter.</p>
                        <p>I also think at this stage of the proceedings it is sufficient for us to
                            continue to call attention to the fact that the German authorities are
                            not in favor of indiscriminate German loans. It would be all right for
                            us to ask them whether they have received the consent of the Advisory
                            Board if we knew that any such board was going to exercise any real
                            control. Up to the present time, we have no such information after
                            repeated inquiries to Berlin; in fact, we are advised by our Ambassador
                            that there is no likelihood that there will be any real control
                            exercised.</p>
                        <p>Please let me know as soon as possible whether you agree, since, as you
                            know, several German loans are now pending before this Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            letter of November 14, 1925,<note n="77" xml:id="d161fn77">Not
                                printed.</note> regarding your interest in a proposed loan of
                            $3,000,000 to the City of Duisberg for the purposes and under the terms
                            set forth therein.</p>
                        <p>Since the flotation of the German external loan provided for by the Dawes
                            plan, offerings of German loans in the American market have aggregated,
                            according to the information before this Department, about $200,000,000,
                            and it appears that a considerable volume of additional German financing
                            is now in contemplation. In addition to the public offerings referred to
                            above, the Department is informed that a large amount of private bank
                            and commercial credits has been extended to German interests during the
                            past year.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances the Department believes that American bankers
                            should examine with particular care all German financing that is brought
                            to their attention, with a view to ascertaining whether the loan
                            proceeds are to be used for productive and self-supporting objects that
                            will improve, directly or indirectly, the economic condition of Germany
                            and tend to aid that country in meeting its financial obligations at
                            home and abroad. In this connection I feel that I should inform you that
                            the Department is advised that the German Federal authorities themselves
                            are not disposed to view with favor the indiscriminate placing of German
                            loans in the American market, particularly when the borrowers are German
                            municipalities and the purposes are not productive.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it cannot be said at this time that serious complications in
                            connection with interest and amortization payments by German borrowers
                            may not arise from possible future action by the Agent General and the
                            Transfer Committee. In this connection, your attention is called to a
                            public statement by Mr. Gilbert on November 11, 1925, to the effect that
                            the Transfer Committee is not in a position to give assurances
                            concerning the payment of interest or amortization on German loans
                            floated abroad.<note n="77a" xml:id="d161fn77a">See telegram No. 194,

                            provisions of the Dawes plan, or upon their effect, if any, upon loans
                            such as the one now under consideration by you, it believes that in the
                            interest of yourselves and of your prospective clients you should give
                            careful consideration to this question.</p>

                        <p>While the foregoing considerations involve questions of business risk,
                            and while the Department does not in any case pass upon the merits of
                            foreign loans as business propositions, it is unwilling, in view of the
                            uncertainties of the situation, to allow the matter to pass without
                            calling the foregoing considerations to your attention. In reply to your
                            inquiry, however, I wish to state that there appear to be no questions
                            of Government policy involved which would justify the Department in
                            offering objection to the loan in question.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to previous correspondence on
                            the subject of German public loans, and with special reference to my
                            telegram No. 196, dated November 14, 1 p.m., I have the honor to report
                            that, according to a statement of the Beratungsstelle (Advisory
                            Committee) of the Finance Ministry, the following public loans have been
                            authorized since November 14: <list>
                                <item>The City of Duisburg, 3 million dollars.</item>
                                <item>The City of Dresden, 5 million dollars.</item>
                                <item>The Central Bank of Baden, 15.7 million marks.</item>
                                <item>The Landesbank of Hessen in Darmstadt, 4 million
                                    dollars.</item>
                                <item>The City of Berlin, 30 million Swiss francs.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In this connection it is interesting to note that the Government circles
                            have finally come to realize that they must at least make a show of
                            instituting some effective control of public loans. Reports from Dr.
                            Schacht, which they have received recently, have convinced them that, in
                            view of the attitude of the Department of State in Washington, it has
                            become urgently necessary for the Finance Ministry here to endeavor to
                            persuade the American Government that the German Government is prepared
                            to take appropriate measures to put in a system of effective control of
                            public borrowing. Therefore, I assume that when Dr. Schacht returns, a
                            good deal of play will be made of carrying this out. As I have often
                            intimated before, however, in view of the continuing scramble for
                            Municipal loans, and in view of domestic constitutional difficulties, I
                            am not very sanguine as to the ultimate success of these endeavors.</p>

                            <p>Under section 213, subdivision 8, of the Revenue Act of 1921 of the
                                United States of America, the income derived exclusively from the
                                operation of a ship or ships of a foreign company is exempted from
                                the income tax if the company is subject to the laws of a foreign
                                state which grants reciprocal rights to the United States. At the
                                instance of the Embassy of the United States of America, I declare
                                myself as agreeing, upon the assumption of full reciprocity and with
                                the reservation of the right of revocation at any time, under
                                authority of section 108, subdivision 1, of the Federal Tax Law,
                                that in the case of companies operated for profit, whose domicile
                                and place of management is in the United States of America, the
                                income which is derived exclusively from the operation of ships
                                shall not be subjected to the corporation tax. A corporation-tax
                                return for the aforesaid income is not to be required of North
                                American companies which maintain in this country a branch or other
                                place of operation or a permanent representative. I request that the
                                finance offices charged with making the assessments be notified
                                forthwith.</p>

                        <p>79. Your 137, September 7, 9 A.M. Treasury Department states that it is
                            necessary for a foreign government to exempt citizens of the United
                            States not residing in the foreign country concerned as well as domestic
                            corporations from tax on earnings from sources <pb n="190"

                            (8) of the Revenue Act of 1921.</p>

                                <p>In the Ordinance of August 10, 1923, it is noted “that in the
                                    case of companies operated for profit, whose domicile and place
                                    of management is in the United States of America, the income
                                    which is derived exclusively from the operation of ships, shall
                                    not be subjected to the corporation tax. A corporation tax
                                    return for the aforesaid income is not to be required of North
                                    American companies which maintain in this country a branch or
                                    other place of operation or a continuous [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >permanent</hi>] representative.”</p>
                                <p>Under this provision of the Ordinance of August 10, 1923, it
                                    appears that an American corporation whose place of management,
                                    for instance, is in London, might possibly be taxed while an
                                    American corporation whose place of management is in the United
                                    States or Germany, would be exempted. In order for individual
                                    Germans and German shipping companies to be entitled, under the
                                    provisions of American law, to the benefits of reciprocity in
                                    the matter of exemption from taxation, it would be necessary for
                                    the ordinance of August 10, 1923, to apply to all corporations
                                    organized in the United States regardless of the place of
                                    management.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, in order to enable the Government of the United States
                                    to pass upon the question as to whether equivalent exemption is
                                    applicable from January 1, 1921, the Treasury Department states
                                    that it will be necessary for the German Government to show that
                                    citizens of the United States non-resident as to Germany and
                                    domestic corporations have not been subjected to income and
                                    corporation tax since January 1, 1921, on the earnings derived

                                residence in Germany has not been subjected to the German income tax

                                January 1, 1921, if the American Government grants reciprocity. The

                                <p>After careful consideration, this Department is of the opinion
                                    that in view of the categorical statement of the German

                                    Minister of Finance to his order of August 10, 1923, Germany
                                    will meet the equivalent exemption provision of Section 213 (<hi

                                    the issuance of the necessary orders referred to in the Note
                                    under consideration. The same opinion is herein <pb n="196"
                                        xml:id="pg_196" facs="0278"/>expressed with respect to the
                                    years 1921, 1922 and 1923, under the provision of Section 213
                                        (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue Act of
                                    1921.</p>
                                <p>Accordingly, it is requested that the German Government be
                                    apprised that upon completion of the action proposed in the Note
                                    of the Foreign Office of September 3, 1924, the equivalent
                                    exemption provision of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                    (8) of both the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 will be satisfied
                                    and that the income of a nonresident alien or foreign
                                    corporation from sources within the United States which consists
                                    exclusively of earnings of a ship or ships documented under the
                                    laws of Germany will be exempt from Federal Income tax and that
                                    such exemption will be applicable for the year 1921 and
                                    subsequent years. In this connection it should be pointed out
                                    that certain German shipping concerns have been granted until
                                    December 15th to complete their 1923 tax returns and it is
                                    desirable that this information be communicated to the German
                                    Government as expeditiously as possible. This Department would
                                    appreciate prompt advice of the action of the competent German
                                    authorities.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>You will observe from the foregoing that the Treasury Department refers
                            to the categorical statement of the German Foreign Office “that the
                            German Government will abstain from a supplementary collection of taxes
                            for the period since January 1, 1921, if the American Government grants
                            reciprocity” and that this statement is a “binding official declaration
                            of the German Government”. You will also observe that the Treasury
                            Department states that in view of this categorical statement and a
                            proposed amendment by the Commonwealth Minister of Finance to his Order
                            of August 10, 1923, it considers that Germany will meet the equivalent
                            exemption provision of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of the
                            Revenue Act of 1924 upon the issuance of the necessary orders referred
                            to in the note of the Foreign Office of September 3, 1924. The Treasury
                            Department expresses the same opinion with respect to the years 1921,
                            1922 and 1923 under the provision of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1921.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the suggestion of the Treasury Department it is
                            desired that you advise the Foreign Office that upon the completion of
                            the action proposed in its note of September 3, 1924, the equivalent
                            exemption provision of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of
                            both of the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 will be satisfied and that the
                            income of a nonresident alien or foreign corporation from sources within
                            the United States which consists exclusively of earnings of a ship or
                            ships documented under the laws of Germany will be exempt from Federal
                            income tax and that such exemption will be applicable for the year 1921
                            and subsequent years. You will observe that the Treasury Department
                            states that as certain German shipping concerns have been granted until
                            December 15 to complete their 1923 tax returns, it is desirable that
                            this information be conveyed to the German authorities as expeditiously
                            as possible.</p>
                        <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0279"/>
                        <p>It is desired that you advise the Department as soon as possible with
                            respect to the action taken by the German authorities in the matter of
                            the proposed amendment by the Minister of Finance of his Order of August
                            10, 1923, so that the Treasury Department may, in turn, be definitely
                            advised in the premises,</p>

                                    “B” mandates, His Majesty’s Government had never desired to
                                    deprive the United States of the fruits of a victory to which
                                    they had so generously <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0297"

                                    their existing treaty engagements. In this spirit His Majesty’s
                                    Government entered upon the negotiation of treaties to regulate
                                    the position of the United States in the territories in question
                                    and have, as you are aware, concluded such treaties in terms

                                    administered under “C” mandates have been carefully examined
                                    with the object of determining how far it is possible to adopt
                                    in these territories a procedure similar to that followed in the
                                    case of the territories referred to in the preceding paragraph.
                                    This examination has led both His Majesty’s Government and the
                                    Governments of the Dominions to the conclusion that it will not
                                    be possible to treat the “C” mandated territories on the same
                                    footing as those administered under the “A” and “B” mandates for
                                    the following reasons:</item>

                                <item>The terms of the different types of mandate vary fundamentally
                                    and this variation has its basis in the terms of the Treaty of
                                        Versailles.<note n="11" xml:id="d175fn11">Malloy, <hi

                                    that the United States have not ratified that treaty, but that
                                    does not alter the fact that, as between Germany and those
                                    powers which have ratified it, those provisions are binding.
                                    Under article 119 of the treaty Germany renounced “in favour of
                                    the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights and
                                    titles over her oversea possessions.” Under article 22 those
                                    possessions situated in South West Africa and the Southern
                                    Pacific were assigned to the mandatory with provision for their
                                    administration “under the laws of the mandatory as integral
                                    portions of its territory.” This provision was incorporated in
                                    the terms of the “C” mandates which, as your Government are
                                    aware, have been approved and confirmed by the Council of the

                                    New Zealand and the Union of South Africa refrained from
                                    pressing the question of the annexation of these particular
                                    territories at the earnest request of the United States
                                    Government or president at the time, but only on the express
                                    understanding that in return for accepting, instead, mandates
                                    over these territories, they would be free to administer them as
                                    integral parts of the mandatory dominions. It is impossible now
                                    to admit any departure from this express understanding.</item>

                            No. 94 of March 7, 1925, wherein you report that the Foreign Office has
                            been informed by the British Ambassador in Washington that the United
                            States Senate has advised and given its consent to the ratification of
                            the Convention between the United States and Great Britain, signed at
                            London on December 3, 1924, with respect to the rights of the two
                            Governments and their nationals in Palestine. It is noted that, in an
                            informal communication, the Foreign Office has asked whether this <pb

                        <p>Since the receipt of your above-mentioned telegram of March 7, 1925, the
                            Department has communicated by telegram with the Consul at
                                Jerusalem<note n="18" xml:id="d179fn18">Not printed.</note> with a
                            view to obtaining a recapitulation of all matters in which the Palestine
                            authorities would appear to have taken action prejudicial to the rights
                            of American citizens or interests as outlined above. In reply, the
                            Consul reports<note n="19" xml:id="d179fn19">By telegram of Mar. 26,
                                1925; not printed.</note> that, in disregard of the agreement
                            between the Consulate and the Legal Secretary, eight judgments against
                            American citizens or interests have been rendered by the Palestine
                            Courts, that two of such judgments have been executed without the
                            assistance of the Consulate and that there is now pending in a Palestine
                            Court one case wherein an American citizen is named as defendant. The
                            Consul adds that, in each of the cases referred to, he has lodged a
                            written protest against the action of the Palestine authorities.</p>
                        <p>In making such protests the Consul has based his action on the following
                            considerations: Article 8 of the Convention of December 3, 1924,
                            provides that it shall enter into effect only upon the exchange of
                            ratifications by the contracting parties; Article 8 of the Mandate for
                            Palestine (incorporated in the preamble to the Convention) provides
                            that, during the period of the Mandate, “the privileges and immunities
                            of foreigners, including the benefits of consular jurisdiction and
                            protection as formerly enjoyed by capitulation or usage in the Ottoman
                            Empire, shall not be applicable in Palestine”; and the United States
                            Government has consistently maintained the position that the privileges
                            and immunities in question could be relinquished <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0301"/>only by treaty agreement. The
                            conclusion logically to be drawn from the foregoing considerations was
                            that, pending the exchange of ratifications of the Convention of
                            December 3, 1924, the Consul at Jerusalem should continue to exercise
                            extraterritorial jurisdiction in cases, involving American citizens,
                            which, under the capitulatory regime, were properly within the
                            jurisdiction of the American Consular Court.</p>
                        <p>That this conclusion was accepted in principle is shown by the
                            above-mentioned agreement concluded in 1922 and 1923 between the
                            Consulate and the Legal Secretary of the Palestine Government. The
                            detailed scope of this provisional agreement is set forth in the
                            enclosures to the Department’s instruction No. 977 of October 4,
                                1923,<note n="20" xml:id="d179fn20"><ref target="frus1923v02#pg_222"

                        <p>You will also find in the Department’s instruction No. 977 of October 4,
                            1923, a discussion of the circumstances which, in certain cases, led to
                            the non-application of the terms of this provisional agreement. In this
                            connection reference is also made to the Department’s instruction No.
                            1004 of October 30, 1923,<note n="21" xml:id="d179fn21">Not
                                printed.</note> transmitting a copy of a judgment, rendered by the
                            Palestine Court of Appeals, in which the Court set forth its reasons for
                            not following the procedure provided for in the provisional agreement.
                            It is presumably under the provisions of this judgment that the
                            Palestine Courts have taken cognizance of the nine cases involving
                            American citizens to which reference has been made above. For the
                            reasons already stated, however, the conclusions of the Palestine Court
                            of Appeals were inacceptable to this Government, and in each of the nine
                            cases in question, a formal written protest was made by the Consul at
                            Jerusalem to the proper authorities of the Palestine Government.</p>
                        <p>These reasons persist today, and before proceeding to the exchange of
                            ratifications of the Convention of December 3, 1924, the Department
                            desires you to ascertain whether the British Government is prepared to
                            give assurances in the following sense: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>

                                <item>That the two judgments, already rendered by the Palestine

                                    will be cancelled and that sums collected from American citizens
                                    without the assistance of the Consulate will be refunded,
                                    and</item>

                                <item>That the six judgments, already rendered but not as yet
                                    executed, will not be executed after the exchange of
                                    ratifications.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you discuss this question informally with the
                            proper official of the Foreign Office and report the results of your
                            representations. In such conversations you may add that, <pb n="220"

                            no objection to the retrial of the nine cases in question. You may
                            suggest also that a further reason for desiring these assurances is
                            that, in some, if not all, of the cases in question, judgment was
                            rendered <hi rend="italic">in absentia</hi>, the American defendant
                            having absented himself from the court of trial upon the advice of the

                            jurisdiction by the Palestine Court.</p>
                        <p>You will be careful, in your conversations at the Foreign Office, to
                            reserve for further discussion the question of the imposition upon

                            not received the assent of this Government. That question will be made

                            questions arising out of the projected suspension of the
                            extraterritorial privileges enjoyed by the United States in Palestine.

                            of the Department’s telegram No. 323 of September 15 and its written
                            instruction No. 387 of October 20, 1924.<note n="24" xml:id="d180fn24"
                                >Neither printed.</note> It is reported by the American Consul at
                            Jerusalem that apparently no objection has been raised by other American
                            importers in Palestine to the payment of the increased duties affecting
                            their importations. The duties affecting such importations are
                            understood to have been increased by only three per cent, ad valorem,
                            whereas the increase affecting the importation of matches by Mr. Sachs
                            was approximately two thousand per cent.</p>
                        <p>The pertinent facts in the case of Mr. Sachs are as follows:</p>
                        <p>On August 15, 1924, there was published in the <hi rend="italic">Official
                                Gazette</hi> of the Palestine Government the text of an ordinance,
                            entitled “The Customs Duties Amendment Ordinance 1924”, providing for
                            certain changes in the Palestine tariff. One of the changes thus set
                            forth increased the duty on matches from 11 per cent, ad valorem to P.
                            T. 20 per gross boxes, not exceeding 10,000 matches, an increase
                            approximately from P. T. 75 to P. T. 1,000 per shipping case of matches.
                            The collection of duties under this ordinance was begun on August 16.
                            Sometime previous to the promulgation of this ordinance (it is stated
                            “in July”) Mr. Elimelech Sachs, an American citizen, had ordered a
                            quantity (350 shipping cases or 17,500 gross boxes) of matches. His
                            shipment arrived in Palestine on August 18, and duty was assessed
                            thereon in the amount of L. E. 3,500 under the new tariff instead of L.
                            E. 180 under the old tariff. The difference L. E. 3,320 was equivalent
                            to slightly over $15,000 at the then prevailing rate of exchange. Mr.
                            Sachs declined to pay the increased duty and protested to the Consul at
                            Jerusalem. The Consul addressed a formal protest to the Palestine
                            Government and informed the Department, which, through the Embassy at
                            London, brought the matter to the attention of the British Foreign
                            Office. On December 3 the Foreign Office inquired through the

                        <p>Apparently no further action has been taken in this matter by the British
                            Foreign Office, other than in its informal inquiry of March 7, 1925,
                            through the Embassy, whether this Government was prepared to proceed to
                            an exchange of ratifications of the Palestine Mandate Convention.</p>
                        <p>From a report dated March 4, 1925, from the American Consul at
                                Jerusalem<note n="29" xml:id="d180fn29">Not printed.</note> it would
                            appear that, pending a decision as to the admissibility of this
                            consignment under the previously prevailing duty, it has been refused
                            entry except upon payment of the increased duty and has been held in the
                            customs bonded warehouse at the port of Jaffa, where it has become
                            subject to considerable storage charges. It appears to be clearly
                            established that this shipment was such as might reasonably have been
                            made to Mr. Sachs in the normal course of his dealings in matches and
                            that his order therefor was not placed with any knowledge of or in
                            anticipation of the subsequent increase in the Palestine import duty as
                            affecting this commodity. Nor does there appear to be any doubt that,
                            should he now be required to enter this shipment at the new rate of
                            duty, he would sustain a considerable actual pecuniary loss. From a
                            further report from the Consul at Jerusalem, dated June 17, 1925,<note
                                n="29" xml:id="d180fn31">Not printed.</note> it appears that such
                            actual loss “would be 1400 Egyptian pounds besides accrued interest and
                            storage charges”. The principal item included in this loss, that of 1400
                            Egyptian pounds, is attributed to the circumstance that “owing to active
                            smuggling from Syria and Trans-Jordan matches are now sold here
                            (Jerusalem) at a price that scarcely pays new duty, not to mention
                            original costs”.</p>
                        <p>It will be obvious to the British Government that under the circumstances
                            Mr. Sachs was entitled to have his shipment of matches enter at the
                            former rate of duty which would have amounted to L. E. 180, instead of
                            at the new rate which amounted to L. E. 3500. It is realized, however,
                            that this would have allowed him a considerable advantage over
                            competitors paying the new rate of duty by permitting him to undersell
                            his competitors and still obtain a very large percentage of profit.
                            While this Government does not desire to take advantage of the situation
                            by insisting, as it might well do, that the <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223"
                                facs="0305"/>matches should be entered at the duty obtaining at the
                            time the purchase was made, it does consider that it is under the
                            necessity of protecting Mr. Sachs against loss. This, it is believed,
                            might be accomplished were the Palestine authorities who are now
                            detaining Mr. Sachs’ matches to take over the shipment <hi rend="italic"
                                >in toto</hi> and pay to him an amount which would reimburse him for
                            his outlay and allow a reasonable profit, or were they to release the
                            goods to him under such circumstances as will make such result possible.
                            Should this second course be followed the Department is of the opinion
                            that (1) accrued storage dues on the shipment of matches to Mr. Sachs
                            should be remitted, (2) he should be indemnified for the difference
                            between the market value in Palestine of the shipment and its original
                            cost plus the present customs duty thereon, (3) he should be relieved of
                            any loss of accrued interest he may have sustained, and (4) he should
                            receive an amount equal to such reasonable profit as might have accrued
                            on the sale of this shipment had the new duty not been put into
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing discussion of the case of Mr. Elimelech Sachs is
                            communicated to you to the end that, providing the British Government is
                            prepared to give the desired assurances with regard to the judicial
                            questions which were the subject of the Department’s instruction No. 631
                            of April 21, 1925, you may be able to discuss informally with the
                            British Foreign Office the further assurances desired by this Government
                            in connection with the exchange of ratifications of the Palestine
                            Mandate Convention. In discussing the case of Mr. Sachs with the British
                            Foreign Office, you should point out that the Department, in again
                            raising this question at this time, does not desire in any way to place
                            any unnecessary difficulties in the way of the coming into effect of the
                            Convention at the earliest possible moment, and that it is not disposed
                            to make an issue of the omission of the British Government to seek and
                            obtain the assent of this Government to the increase of the Palestine
                            tariff affecting the shipment of Mr. Sachs. It is, however, the
                            Department’s opinion, an opinion in which it is believed the British
                            Government will readily concur, that, in the circumstances of the case
                            of Mr. Sachs, adequate provision should be made to obviate the
                            possibility of his sustaining any loss as a result of the application to
                            his shipment of matches of the increased tariff of August 15, 1924.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, you may, in your discretion, inform the Foreign Office
                            that, should the British Government be prepared to give the desired
                            assurances in connection with the case of Mr. Sachs, this Government
                            will raise no further objection to the action of the British
                            authorities, in providing for an increase in the Palestine tariff and in
                            applying such tariff to the merchandise of American nationals, <pb

                            enclosed today which I am sending you in great haste and without much
                            comment as the pouch leaves almost immediately.<note n="32"
                                xml:id="d181fn32">The enclosed document is identical with the note
                                from the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the
                                American Ambassador, Oct. 13, 1925, <ref target="#pg_226">p.
                                    226</ref>.</note> The document is a suggested reply to the
                            Department’s representations against the decisions rendered by the
                            Palestine Courts against American citizens and the increased customs
                            dues imposed on Mr. Sachs, and is an attempt to bring to a friendly
                            conclusion the whole vexatious question. He tells me that the Foreign
                            Office has labored very hard with the Colonial Office in order to get as
                            much as is contained in the reply and that he believes it will be
                            difficult to secure any further concessions from the latter. He prefers,
                            however, to get your views as to whether the proposed settlement will be
                            satisfactory to the State Department before sending an official answer
                            which might not be acceptable to you, and consequently again postpone an
                            arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I think that Oliphant is quite sincere in his statement that he has
                            worked very hard on this matter, realizing the justice of the American
                            point of view, but at the same time feeling that it is impracticable to
                            nullify and reverse action already taken by the Palestine Government. He
                            assures me that the Foreign Office will do everything in its power to
                            prevent further complications after the exchange of ratifications.</p>
                        <p>If you will telegraph me briefly after considering the proposed reply
                            whether it is satisfactory or not, I will so inform Oliphant. If <pb
                                n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0307"/>your telegram states that such
                            a reply would be acceptable Oliphant promises to write officially to the
                            Embassy at once.</p>

                                citizens in Palestine prior to and pending the entry into force of
                                the Anglo-American Palestine Mandate Convention of December 3rd
                                1924. His Majesty’s Government understand that the United States
                                Government desire to reach a friendly settlement of <pb n="227"
                                    xml:id="pg_227" facs="0309"/>the outstanding cases that have
                                arisen in connection with this subject, before the Convention
                                concerned is actually brought into force by the formal exchange of
                                the ratifications which have already taken place. As from the date
                                of this exchange the position will of course be fully regularised,
                                and no further cases of this type can arise. It is therefore
                                desirable from every point of view that the exchange of
                                ratifications should take place with the least possible delay.</p>

                                <item>The particular cases of which a settlement is desired fall
                                    into two main categories—administrative and legal. As regards
                                    the former, His Majesty’s Government fully understand the
                                    position taken up by the Government of the United States, that
                                    their prior assent is indispensable to the imposition of any
                                    dues or taxes upon United States citizens in Palestine pending
                                    the entry into force of the Convention. His Majesty’s Government
                                    realize, moreover, that this position has not been changed by
                                    the mere signature of the Convention. It appears, however, that
                                    only one case in this category—that of Mr. Sachs—has formed the
                                    subject of protest by the United States authorities. I
                                    understand from your memorandum of July 3rd last that the views
                                    of your government in this matter could be satisfactorily met by
                                    the remittance of the accrued storage dues on the shipment of
                                    matches to Mr. Sachs; by his indemnification for the difference
                                    between the market value in Palestine of the shipment and its
                                    original cost, together with the present Customs duty thereon;
                                    by Mr. Sachs being relieved of any loss of accrued interest
                                    which he may have sustained as a result of the action of the
                                    Palestine authorities in this matter; and by his receiving an
                                    amount equal to such reasonable profit as might have accrued on
                                    the sale of this shipment had the new duty not been put into
                                    effect. His Majesty’s Government while adhering to their own
                                    views in regard to the questions of principle involved, which,
                                    as you are aware, are in conflict with those held by your
                                    government, are willing to undertake, on behalf of the Palestine
                                    Government, that the steps suggested above as regards the
                                    particular case of Mr. Sachs’ shipment of matches will be taken
                                    by the Palestine Government immediately after the entry into
                                    force of the Convention. As regards the question of principle,
                                    His Majesty’s Government consider now that adequate provision
                                    has been made for the future, the situation will be adequately
                                    met if each government takes formal note of the view held by the
                                    other, while at the same time expressing its regret that it is
                                    unable on grounds of principle to conform thereto.</item>

                                    force of the Palestine Mandate Convention, His Majesty’s
                                    Government notice with satisfaction that the United States
                                    Government have no objection to the retrial by the Palestinian
                                    Courts of the cases concerned, but regret that it is not
                                    possible for them to take the measures suggested in your notes
                                    under reply. Such measures would involve <hi rend="italic">ex

                                    again it appears that the only solution is that suggested above:
                                    that is, for each government to take formal note of the view
                                    held by the other, while expressing its regret that it is unable

                                <item>If there is any civil case, however, in which a United States
                                    citizen has refused to appear in the Palestinian courts, relying
                                    upon his rights under the former capitulatory system, and where
                                    he alleges that he had a good defence and that, had he appeared,
                                    the judgment would therefore not have been entered against him,
                                    the Palestinian Government will be prepared to request the Chief
                                    Justice, or some other responsible officer, to investigate the
                                    case. Should this officer, as a result of his investigations,
                                    form the opinion that the defence, which would have been put
                                    forward by the American citizen had he appeared, would have
                                    succeeded, His Majesty’s Government will undertake that the
                                    Palestine Government will offer fair compensation to the United
                                    States citizen concerned as an act of diplomatic courtesy not
                                    affecting the question of principle involved.</item>

                                <item>It does not appear to His Majesty’s Government that any useful
                                    purpose would be served by a further discussion of the
                                    complicated legal position arising out of the abolition of the
                                    capitulations prior to the entry into force of the Convention.
                                    It is apparent that the views held by His Majesty’s Government,
                                    as Mandatories for Palestine, and those held by the United
                                    States Government on this matter cannot be reconciled, and, in
                                    view of the conclusion of the Mandate Convention, further
                                    attempts to reconcile these views appear unnecessary. His
                                    Majesty’s Government have, however, no desire to obtain from the
                                    Government of the United States any formal abandonment of the
                                    capitulatory rights of United States citizens in Palestine prior
                                    to the entry into force of the Convention. On the contrary, they
                                    readily take formal note of the fact that the claim to these
                                    rights was not abandoned by the United States Government. At the
                                    same time they feel convinced that the United States Government
                                    will equally appreciate the position of His Majesty’s
                                    Government, and will as a friendly act refrain from pressing
                                    them to recede therefrom.</item>

                        <p>349. Your 356, November 24, 10 a.m. Department is at loss to understand
                            the reason for delay in exchange of ratifications of Palestine
                            Convention. Embassy’s note, based on Department’s instruction of October
                            13, was a reply to the Foreign Office communication of that date and
                            does not necessitate further correspondence or require any other action
                            than formal exchange of ratifications.</p>
                        <p>In note of October 13 Foreign Office stated “It is desirable from every
                            point of view that the exchange of ratifications should take place with
                            the least possible delay”. To meet this desire, and because the
                            Department appreciated the difficulty of attempting final determination
                            of the conflicting legal viewpoints advanced, the assurances in British
                            note were accepted as a basis for exchange of ratifications.</p>
                        <p>With existing troubled situation in the mandate territories, it is
                            important for the Department to know promptly whether it can depend upon
                            treaty arrangements for the determination of its rights.</p>
                        <p>Orally present these considerations to Foreign Office and endeavor to
                            arrange prompt exchange of ratifications. Telegraph result of your

                            which the British submitted to the League with the object of defining
                            British responsibilities and rights in Iraq.<note n="45"

                            the view which we have held consistently that this Government has a
                            right to be consulted regarding dispositions made with respect to
                            territories under mandate. The resolution adopted by the League on the
                            initiative of the British Government purports to deal with the
                            capitulatory rights of foreigners in Iraq. It fails apparently to
                            include provisions which might help to guard against improper monopolies
                            and protect the principle of equality of opportunity in Iraq. I am at a
                            loss to understand the action of the British Government in proceeding in
                            this matter as outlined above without conferring with our Government, in

                            this Government to be consulted with respect to the form of the
                            Mandatory arrangements for territories detached from Germany and her
                            Allies as a result of the war. This Government in this correspondence
                            further indicated its views with regard to the principles which it

                        <p>From such examination it does not appear that any of the latter

                            the termination of British responsibility in Iraq. The penultimate

                        <p>Article 8 of the Palestine Mandate, on the other hand, after reciting, in

                            adequate provisions with respect to equality of economic opportunity in

                            represent the position of the British Foreign Office to be that the
                            provisions of Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty are sufficient to
                            preclude the possibility of any discrimination in this particular

                        <p>Apparently no such assurance has been communicated to this Government.
                            From time to time, however, as the situation in Mesopotamia developed,
                            the British Government has supplied this Government with various
                            publications and information dealing with the changing character of what
                            it considered to be its responsibilities as Mandatory with regard to

                            of June 13, 1923 (see the Department’s instruction No. 943 of July 21,

                        <p>You will of course appreciate that this Government could not acquiesce in
                            the view that any agreement between Great Britain and Iraq or any
                            instrument accepted by the Council of the League of Nations with
                            reference to Iraq could prejudice existing American rights in that
                            territory. In particular, the Capitulatory rights of the United States
                            are considered still to persist in Iraq pending the consummation of a
                            suitable treaty arrangement with the appropriate authorities. The
                            Department considers, therefore, that, when an appropriate opportunity
                            arises, it may be desirable to conclude with the competent authorities
                            an agreement embodying its consent, on appropriate terms and provided
                            the proper safeguards for American interests are secured, to the
                            arrangements which have been reached with reference to Iraq. It is
                            possible that such an agreement might best be concluded in the form of a
                            convention between the United States and Great Britain, and possibly
                            Iraq, embodying a reference to the Anglo-Iraq Treaty and related

                        <p>The foregoing discussion of this Government’s views regarding the
                            situation created by the Decision of September 27, 1924, may be
                            supplemented by a brief reference to the exchange of notes early in 1921
                            between the Secretary of State and the President of the Council of the
                            League of Nations. The pertinent sections of the Secretary’s note of

                            November 12, 1924, Series C, No. 54, Syria No. 1, entitled “Mandate for
                            Syria and the Lebanon,” a copy of which was duly transmitted to your
                            Embassy. In Paragraph 7 of the Council’s reply, the following statement
                            is made:— <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“No conclusions will therefore be reached with regard to ‘A’
                                    Mandates until the United States Government has had an
                                    opportunity to express its views.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>A reference to pages 10 to 15 of the above mentioned confidential
                            publication is believed to be sufficient to establish the fact that this
                            Government’s views with regard to “A” Mandates were brought to the
                            attention of the Principal Allied Governments and of the Council of the
                            League of Nations, as well as the fact that such views were duly
                            considered by the Council to the satisfaction of this Government’s
                            contentions in so far as concerned the adoption of the final form of the
                            Syrian Mandate. As already indicated, similar consideration of this
                            Government’s views was given in the adoption of the final draft of the
                            Palestine Mandate. The Department has noted, therefore, with some
                            apprehension that, in connection with the determination of the nature
                            and extent of the responsibilities of Great Britain as the Mandatory
                            Power in Iraq, the British Government, before seeking the approval of
                            the Council of the League of Nations, omitted to consult with this
                            Government and presumably did not take into consideration certain of its
                            expressed views with regard to “A” Mandates, to wit, particularly those
                            views relative to “Capitulatory rights” and to “Provisions against
                            discrimination” (see page 11 of the Department’s confidential
                            publication respecting Syria referred to above).</p>
                        <p>The Department desires, therefore, that you supplement the informal
                            representations to which reference was made in its telegram <pb n="237"

                                <p>“Among the documents recently published by the League of Nations
                                    my Government has noted the text of a decision of the Council of
                                    the League under date of September 27, 1924, relating to the
                                    application of the principles of Article 22 of the Covenant of
                                    the League to the territory of Iraq. It appears that this
                                    decision was taken at the instance of the Government of His
                                    Britannic Majesty following the submission to the Council of a
                                    statement by Lord Parmoor with respect to the circumstances
                                    which made it appear to His Majesty’s Government to be
                                    impracticable to exercise in Iraq a mandate of the form
                                    contemplated in the document which His Majesty’s Government
                                    submitted to the Council in December, 1920. With a draft of the
                                    decision which was adopted by the Council, Lord Parmoor
                                    submitted a copy of the Treaty of October 10, 1922, between His
                                    Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of Iraq, together
                                    with a protocol dated April 30, 1923, and subsidiary agreements
                                    dated March 25, 1924. Lord Parmoor stated that the Treaty and
                                    the connected documents placed the British Government in a
                                    position <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> Iraq to discharge its
                                    obligations toward the League and that all the points embodied
                                    in the original draft mandate would be found to be covered by
                                    these documents, supplemented by the further undertakings
                                    embodied in the draft decision. The effect of the Council’s
                                    decision, so far as concerns the governments which accepted that
                                    decision, appears to be to substitute for the original draft
                                    mandate the arrangements of His Majesty’s Government with the
                                    Government of Iraq and the undertakings oi His Majesty’s
                                    Government towards members of the League.</p>
                                <p>Your Excellency will undoubtedly recall the extended
                                    correspondence between His Majesty’s Government and the
                                    Government of the United States, as well as the correspondence
                                    which my Government had with the Council of the League of
                                    Nations, regarding the right of the United States to be
                                    consulted with respect to the character and conditions of the
                                    administration of territories detached from the Ottoman Empire
                                    as a result of the common victory over the Central Powers. I

                                    Majesty’s Government asserted that it had no desire to challenge
                                    the statement of my Government concerning the relation of the
                                    victory over Turkey to the victory over Germany and disclaimed
                                    any intention to discriminate against nationals of the United
                                    States or refuse them full equality of commercial opportunity in

                                    victory. It was the understanding of my Government that its
                                    right to be consulted with respect to the character and
                                    conditions of the administration to be established in
                                    Mesopotamia was fully acknowledged by His Majesty’s Government,
                                    as well as by the Council of the League of Nations, and after
                                    the statement <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0320"/>of Sir
                                    Eyre Crowe in the communication of December 29, 1921, above
                                    mentioned, with reference to the presentation of a further
                                    memorandum in which he hoped to be able to give the American
                                    Ambassador the fullest assurance regarding the mandate for
                                    Mesopotamia, my Government entertained no doubt that it would be
                                    consulted before the consummation of final arrangements in
                                    regard to the administration of Mesopotamia. The expectation of
                                    my Government that it would be consulted in regard to the
                                    administration of this territory was supported by the fact that,
                                    before the adoption by the Council of the League of the British
                                    mandate for Palestine and the French mandate for Syria and the
                                    Lebanon, my Government was given an opportunity to express its
                                    views regarding the terms of those mandates.</p>
                                <p>My Government has fully appreciated the fact that the political
                                    situation in Iraq has changed in material respects since the
                                    draft mandate for that territory was first presented. It has no
                                    disposition to question in principle the necessity for a
                                    modification of the mandatory arrangement in the general sense
                                    of the decision adopted by the Council on September 27, 1924. It
                                    has noted, however, with some apprehension, the omission from
                                    the modified arrangement of provisions similar to those inserted
                                    in the mandate for Syria and the Lebanon respecting the
                                    reestablishment of the capitulations upon the termination of the
                                    mandatory arrangements and respecting the observance of the
                                    principle of equality of opportunity in regard to the
                                    exploitation of the natural resources of the mandated territory.
                                    It is firmly of the opinion that no arrangements to which it is
                                    not a party could modify the rights to which it is entitled in
                                    Iraq by virtue of the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, and
                                    it believes that, in accordance with the principles which my
                                    Government has consistently advocated and which it is not
                                    believed His Majesty’s Government would be disposed to contest,
                                    American nationals should be placed on an equal footing with the
                                    nationals of any of the Allied Powers with respect to economic
                                    and other rights in Iraq.</p>
                                <p>While my Government has no desire to question the finality of the
                                    acceptance which other governments may have accorded to the
                                    arrangements between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the
                                    King of Iraq, and is not disposed to suggest a reconsideration
                                    of the general arrangement reached, it would be pleased to be
                                    informed whether His Majesty’s Government, as the Mandatory
                                    Power in Iraq, is prepared to give assurances of the character
                                    believed to be necessary for the regularization of the situation
                                    of Iraq in relation to the United States. Such assurances, I may
                                    state, might, in the opinion of my Government, be appropriately
                                    embodied in a convention somewhat similar to that recently
                                    concluded with respect to Palestine. In view of the particular
                                    situation existing in Iraq it might be desirable to consider the
                                    possibility of securing the concurrence of Iraq in any such
                                    arrangement.”</p>

                            <item>The Department has been informed by the American Group that there
                                is serious danger that their negotiations with the Turkish Petroleum
                                Company will reach an impasse due to failure up to now of the other
                                groups in the Turkish Petroleum Company to come to an agreement with
                                Mr. C. S. Gulbenkian.<note n="69" xml:id="d190fn69">Calouste Sarkis

                                situation described in that telegram is very much like that existing

                            <item>The American Group informs the Department that they would be
                                sincerely sorry to have to withdraw from further attempts to obtain
                                participation in the Turkish Petroleum Company on a fair basis and
                                that they are still hopeful that an agreement will be reached which
                                will make participation possible. Negotiations with the Turkish
                                Petroleum Company are being carried on by Mr. Piesse on behalf of
                                the American Group.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>You may wish to confer with Mr. Piesse regarding the status of the
                                negotiations at present. However, such a critical stage seems to
                                have been reached that the Department wishes you promptly to present
                                the matter again orally to the British Foreign Office, setting forth
                                the view which the Department has consistently maintained and which
                                is fully explained in its telegram No. 331 of September 20, 1924.
                                Except for subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the third
                                paragraph, the considerations presented in the third, fourth, and
                                fifth paragraphs of that telegram apply to the present situation as
                                well as they did to that of last year. On the point covered by
                                section (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of the third paragraph, the
                                situation is modified by the fact that a concessionary contract
                                between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Iraq Cabinet has been
                                    signed,<note n="71" xml:id="d190fn71">Turkish Petroleum Company,

                                the present claims <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0322"/>are
                                based not on the pre-war claims of the Turkish Petroleum Company but
                                upon the recent alleged concessionary grant.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>In making your representations at the Foreign Office you should
                                stress especially the views outlined in the fifth paragraph of the
                                telegram of September 20. The Department is aware that neither our
                                Government nor the British Government would wish to intervene in
                                negotiations which are of a purely business nature. The British
                                Government, however, in view of its connection with the
                                Anglo-Persian Oil Company which is one of the chief parties to these
                                business negotiations, may be able to persuade British subjects or
                                companies not to assume an attitude which would make it impossible
                                for American interests to participate in the Turkish Petroleum
                                Company. It is the belief of the Department that its wish to avoid
                                any further controversy regarding the Mesopotamian oil question is
                                shared by the British Foreign Office. The American and British
                                Governments have agreed on important questions of principle
                                regarding this matter, and the development of a selected part of the
                                Mesopotamian oil field by a company in which important oil interests
                                of four nations were to participate was to give practical
                                application to these principles. Effect was being given to the
                                open-door principle as applied to territories under mandate, and
                                thus there was to be brought about a wide basis of participation in
                                developing these oil resources.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Should the American Group withdraw because of failure to obtain
                                participation in the Turkish Petroleum Company on a fair basis, the
                                Department would reserve its entire freedom of action if any
                                reasonable and proper efforts should be made by the interested
                                American companies to secure the right to a fair share in the
                                development of the oil resources of Mesopotamia through other means
                                than the Turkish Petroleum Company.</item>

                                would consider sending a written communication on this subject.

                                >Lancelot Oliphant, head of the Eastern Department of the British
                                Foreign Office.</note> gave fullest assurances of the desire of the
                            British Government to see American interests remain. From the latest
                            information the Foreign Office is hopeful that the proposal to resort to
                            arbitration will be accepted by Gulbenkian and by the British interests
                            in Turkish Petroleum. Foreign Office has not ceased to urge this course
                            on British group and I understand from Oliphant that French Government
                            has been exercising similar pressure on French group.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question in the House this afternoon the Prime Minister
                            replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“His Majesty’s Government regard as undoubtedly valid the
                                    convention made on March 14, 1925, whereby the Government of
                                    Irak granted to the Turkish Petroleum Company for a period of 75
                                    years the exclusive right to extract and dispose of petroleum
                                    and similar products in the whole of Irak with the exception of
                                    the ‘transferred territories’ and the vilayet of Basra.</p>
                                <p>They welcomed the inclusion of French interests in the Turkish
                                    Petroleum Company and have watched with sympathy negotiations
                                    for the inclusion also of American interests. If these
                                    negotiations result in American interests acquiring an interest
                                    in the Turkish Petroleum Company such a result will be welcomed
                                    by His Majesty’s Government.”</p>

                        <p>The French Government is informed that difficulties have arisen between
                            the French and British Groups on one part and the American Group on the
                            other, which are parts of the Turkish Petroleum Company, concerning the
                            interpretation of the “heads of agreement” agreed upon between them last
                            March and inserted into a final contract.</p>
                        <p>The American Group is threatening to withdraw and to negotiate by itself
                            with the Turkish interests.</p>
                        <p>The British and French Governments are proposing that the question should
                            be settled by arbitration. Such a procedure would be entrusted with four
                            experts who would have to decide upon the interpretation to be given to
                            the Convention. Should the experts not reach an agreement, they would
                            designate one sur-arbiter and the contract drawn by them would engage
                            all the interested parties.</p>

                        <p>The French Ambassador called to see the Secretary on December 18 and left
                            with him a memorandum, of which a copy is attached,<note n="73"

                            expressing, on behalf of the French Government, the hope that this
                            Government would intervene to prevent a break between the Turkish
                            Petroleum Company and the American Group.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked me to outline to the French Ambassador the present
                            status of these negotiations, which I did, somewhat as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>I pointed out that the negotiations between the American Group
                                    and the Turkish Petroleum Company were negotiations of a
                                    business character and that in principle the Department did not
                                    intervene in such negotiations; that we were of course
                                    interested in maintaining the principle of the Open Door in
                                    Mesopotamia and the right of American companies to obtain a fair
                                    share of participation, if they so desired, in the development
                                    of the natural resources of Mesopotamia. This policy the
                                    Department had consistently maintained in correspondence with
                                    the British Government, of which the Ambassador was possibly
                                    aware.</p>
                                <p>I told the Ambassador that the American Group had been
                                    negotiating for the past two or three years with the Turkish
                                    Petroleum Company and that an agreement had been practically
                                    reached when serious difficulty was encountered in view of the
                                    attitude assumed by a minority shareholder in the Turkish
                                    Petroleum Company, Mr. Gulbenkian. The latter had apparently
                                    insisted that the various partners in the Turkish Petroleum
                                    Company should have a stock interest only in the Company, as he
                                    himself only desired such an interest. The American Group, on
                                    the other hand, informed the Department that they were
                                    interested in securing their pro rata share of the crude oil
                                    produced by the Company and were not interested in mere stock
                                    participation.</p>
                                <p>With respect to the suggestion contained in the French
                                    Ambassador’s note that the American Group consent to the
                                    arbitration of <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0325"/>the
                                    outstanding difficulties, and not resort to separate action, I
                                    said that I understood from the American Group that they
                                    considered that the questions at issue were solely between
                                    Gulbenkian and the Turkish Petroleum Company and that they could
                                    neither be a party to nor would they desire to block arbitration
                                    between the Turkish Petroleum Company and Gulbenkian. I added
                                    that I further understood that, in the event that the agreement
                                    which might ultimately be reached between the Turkish Petroleum
                                    Company and Gulbenkian was not of a character to permit the
                                    participation of the various groups in the actual crude oil
                                    produced, or if this agreement imposed onerous charges upon the
                                    prospective participants in the Turkish Petroleum Company, I
                                    could give no assurance that the American Group would not
                                    withdraw. On this point they would have to consult, and would
                                    probably consult, their own business interests.</p>
                                <p>I gathered that the French Ambassador himself did not have any
                                    data on the situation or any knowledge of the background which
                                    had led his Government to make the request contained in his
                                    note.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Later in the day, I read over the telephone to Mr. Swain, of the Standard
                            Oil Company of New Jersey, the pertinent sections of the French
                            Ambassador’s note. Mr. Swain replied that he could only confirm what he
                            had already stated, that the American Group did not see that they could
                            properly be a party to the proposed arbitration; that the questions
                            involved were questions between the European partners and Gulbenkian. If
                            those parties desired to refer their difficulties to arbitration that
                            was their concern.</p>

                                negotiations with the Turkish Petroleum Company and asking whether
                                the Department can do anything further through diplomatic channels
                                regarding the Turkish Petroleum Company and asking whether the
                                Department would object to direct negotiations by the American Group

                                the second question. If the American Group should decide to enter
                                into direct and independent negotiations with Iraq or Turkey it
                                probably would mean that the cooperative effort developed so
                                laboriously during the past three years is ended. Paragraph 2 of our
                                telegram No. 357 of December 5 still accurately reflects attitude of
                                the American Group.</item>

                            <item>It is really important that the door should be kept open for

                            British have not changed their attitude toward American participation in
                            the Turkish Petroleum Company. He told me that British oil interests
                            have been engaged in deadly warfare for some time and he believes that
                            in this conflict American interests have been used as a catspaw. This
                            trouble is now being terminated and under government pressure
                            arbitration is being resorted to. Within a day or two the result will be
                            known, and Tyrrell believes that matters will move smoothly once this
                            difficulty is settled. As soon as the result of arbitration is known,
                            Tyrrell will personally inform me.</p>

                        <p>The so-called “Stevenson Scheme” is a legislative measure under which the
                            amount of rubber exported by the British rubber-growing possessions in
                            the Middle East, is arbitrarily restricted for the purpose of enhancing
                            its price.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this memorandum is to explain the history and operation of
                            this scheme, and to point out the critical situation that now confronts
                            the American rubber manufacturing industry as a result of the artificial
                            curtailment of crude rubber supply which its operation has brought
                            about. This situation is such that an early relaxation of the
                            restriction imposed under this scheme is of the utmost importance to the
                            American rubber industry and to the American consuming public.</p>

                            complete survey of the situation in that part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances it is apparent that any curtailment of the
                            production or shipments of crude rubber by the growers of the British
                            possessions, such as is imposed by the “Stevenson Scheme” must have a
                            very direct effect upon the operations of the American rubber industry.
                            And, since America accounts for about three-fourths of the entire rubber
                            consumption of the world, it is America that is primarily affected by
                            such curtailment.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the conditions leading up to the
                                adoption of the Stevenson scheme in 1922</hi></p>
                        <p>The “Stevenson Scheme” was adopted as a result of a temporary condition
                            of over-supply of crude rubber, as is shown graphically in the attached
                            Exhibit A, in each of the three years immediately following the war, i.
                            e., 1919, 1920, and 1921 when the production of crude rubber exceeded
                            the consumption by a considerable margin. This naturally resulted in
                            depressing the price of the commodity.</p>
                        <p>The year of 1919 showed a substantial increase in rubber consumption over
                            1918, the last year of the war, but this increase did not nearly keep
                            pace with the tremendously increased production. Then came the post-war
                            depression in all business, with the result that instead of the expected
                            large increase in the consumption of rubber in 1920 and 1921, there was
                            a marked decrease in each of these years as compared with the previous
                            year. And, as above stated, in each of these years, the production was
                            far ahead of the consumption.</p>
                        <p>The large stock of rubber on hand as a result of the three years of
                            over-production, brought the price down as low as 14 cents per pound in
                            1921, a price which was asserted to be far below the cost of production.
                            (See attached Exhibit B.)</p>
                        <p>It was this that led to the appointment in 1921 by the British Secretary
                            of State for the Colonies of the so-called “Stevenson Committee” (taking
                            its name from its chairman, Sir James Stevenson, now Lord Stevenson) “to
                            investigate and report upon the present Rubber Situation in British

                            voluntary restriction of production. It also stated that the Dutch
                            Government declined to co-operate in governmental restrictions.
                            Nevertheless, it decided that the situation warranted legislative
                            restriction of production in the British Colonies and Protectorates. The
                            Stevenson Committee therefore recommended that the present “scheme of

                                East.” U. S. Dept. of Commerce 1925. [Footnote in the
                                original.]</note> was to stabilize the price of crude rubber at
                            1s/6d per pound, or roughly about 36 cents. This was fixed as a price
                            which would not only give a satisfactory profit to the producer, but
                            would be sufficient to stimulate the investment of new capital in the
                            planting of additional acreage. The method provided by the scheme for
                            accomplishing this object is as follows: The actual output of each
                            producer for the year beginning Nov. 1, 1919, was taken as his “standard
                            production”. During the first quarter of the operation of the scheme
                            each producer was permitted to export at the low, minimum rate of export
                            duty, only 60 percent of his “standard production”. If he exceeded that
                            percentage he would have to pay what, up to the present, has proved <pb
                                n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0330"/>to be a prohibitive export duty
                            on the entire amount exported. The more the amount exported exceeds the
                            prescribed percentage, the higher the export duty. The prescribed
                            percentage is subject to change each quarter depending upon the average
                            price for the preceding quarter. That is, if the average price for a
                            certain quarter is between 1s/3d and 1s/6d, the prescribed percentage
                            exportable during the following quarter at the minimum rate of duty is
                            increased 5% for the next quarter, and if the price is 1s/6d or over for
                            a given quarter, the prescribed percentage is increased 10%. So also, if
                            the average price falls below Is, the percentage is decreased to 55%,
                            and if that reduction does not raise the average price to 1s/3d in the
                            next quarter, a further reduction in the prescribed percentage to 50%
                            becomes effective, and so on.</p>
                        <p>As is apparent from this brief resume of the scheme, it was an attempt
                            artificially to maintain the price of rubber at 1s/6d by altering the
                            amount of rubber exported or “released” each quarter.</p>

                                scheme</hi></p>
                        <p>The Stevenson Scheme went into operation on November 1, 1922. At that
                            time the world stock of crude rubber was large and it took some time
                            before the effect of the restriction scheme was felt to any great
                            extent. But upon the depletion of the accumulated stock (accompanied by
                            a rapidly increasing rate of rubber consumption) the situation
                            immediately took on a serious aspect. And now, as a result of the
                            operation of the scheme, the price of rubber has been forced up to about
                            three times the normal price of 36 cents, and there is threatened an
                            actual shortage in the amount of rubber needed to meet the requirements
                            of the consuming public. The following schedule tells the story of the
                            operation of the Scheme:</p>

                        <p>The present day price, while of a somewhat speculative character, is
                            believed to be indicative of the actual conditions of supply and demand
                            and to forecast a real shortage of crude rubber supply unless decisive
                            steps are taken by the British authorities to make immediately available
                            a greater amount of rubber than is provided for by the Stevenson Scheme
                            as it now exists.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the large and increasing demand for
                                crude rubber in the united states</hi></p>
                        <p>Not only has the accumulated world stock of rubber been depleted, and the
                            rate of production of rubber reduced by the Stevenson Scheme, but the
                            consumption of rubber in the United States is now increasing very
                            rapidly so that the 1925 consumption figures will be greatly in excess
                            of the figures of any year in the past. This increase in consumption of
                            rubber by our citizens is due to the following causes, namely: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The normal increase in population.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The increasing number of articles that are made in whole or in
                                    part of rubber, and</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The very large increase in the use of automobiles (both
                                    commercial and passenger vehicles), and in the change that has
                                    recently been effected in the type of tires used upon many of
                                    these vehicles.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>This third cause of increased consumption has the greatest effect upon
                            the situation, because approximately 80 per cent of the rubber consumed
                            in the United States goes into the manufacture of motor vehicle tires.
                            The growth of this important, modern and indispensable form of
                            transportation can be visualized by reference to the attached sheet
                            entitled “Production and Registration of Motor Vehicles 1895 to 1924”
                            (attached exhibit E. See also exhibit F, showing the increase in
                            gasoline consumption.) Moreover, the figures for the current year
                            indicate a very large increase in the number of motor vehicles in use,
                            as compared with 1924. But this increase in the number of vehicles does
                            not tell the whole story, for practically all of the cars now being
                            manufactured are equipped with the new types of tires known as “balloon
                            tires” which embody a substantially greater amount of rubber per tire
                            than was formerly the case. Also the rapid development of the motor bus,
                            which is run almost continuously and is equipped with very large tires,
                            accounts for a considerable increase in rubber consumption.</p>
                        <p>Other lines of rubber products in addition to tires include “mechanical
                            rubber goods” such as hose, transmission and conveyor belts, packing,
                            jar rings, etc.”, “footwear”, such as rubbers, boots, arctics,
                            rubber-soled shoes, rubber heels, etc., “drug sundries” such <pb n="250"
                                xml:id="pg_250" facs="0332"/>as hot water bottles, syringes, air
                            cushions, rubber sheeting, gloves, etc., and “hard rubber articles” such
                            as electric battery jars, radio panels, handles, combs, etc. These are
                            only a few of the many thousands of articles, made wholly or partly of
                            rubber, which are essential to the welfare and progress of our people.
                            And in substantially all of these lines the consumption of rubber is
                            steadily increasing.</p>
                        <p>The United States <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have an adequate supply of
                            rubber to meet its increasing needs which will soon outstrip the now
                            anticipated production, even in the absence of any artificial
                            restriction. (See Exhibit G.) And it must be able to purchase it at a
                            reasonable price (for example, the 1s/6d fixed by the British growers as
                            reasonable), so that the American consumer shall not be forced to do
                            without things to which he has been accustomed because he cannot afford
                            to pay for them. The present operation of the Stevenson Scheme threatens
                            an actual shortage of rubber, and, as pointed out above, it has already
                            raised the price of rubber by artificial means to almost three times the
                            normal figure.</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the efforts made by the rubber
                                association to avert the present critical situation</hi></p>
                        <p>The present shortage and high price of rubber, as a result of the
                            Stevenson Scheme, was not unforeseen by American rubber manufacturers.
                            Immediately upon learning of the enactment of the Stevenson Scheme,
                            American manufacturers realized the great danger which it threatened.
                            They considered it to be economically unsound and absolutely
                            unnecessary. And they believed and feared that the increase in rubber
                            consumption in the United States, which was then forecast, would bring
                            about just such a situation as exists today, if the plan were carried
                            out as then intended.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the Rubber Association of America, on behalf of the American
                            manufacturers, opened negotiations with the Rubber Growers Association
                            of London, which represented more than half of the British Crude rubber
                            interests and was understood to have been instrumental in originating
                            the Stevenson Scheme and presenting it to the British Government through
                            the Stevenson Committee. These negotiations early took the form of an
                            invitation to the Rubber Growers Association to send to the United
                            States a Committee which might visualize for the crude rubber growing
                            interests the enormous rubber manufacturing capacity of this country and
                            the great and constantly increasing use of rubber, particularly in the
                            automotive industry. It was hoped that a presentation of the actual
                            facts would cause these representatives of the British growers to
                            realize the necessity of providing an adequate supply of the necessary
                                <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0333"/>raw material and to prevent
                            not only an actual shortage of the material but also an abnormal or
                            speculative market which would retard the growth of the industry and
                            deprive the American people of their needs for rubber products.</p>
                        <p>The personnel of the Committee or Delegation appointed by the Rubber
                            Growers Association of America to visit the United States and to confer
                            with American manufacturers consisted of three men prominent in the
                            development of the crude rubber growing industry, namely— <list>
                                <item>Sir Stanley Bois</item>
                                <item>H. Eric Miller, and</item>
                                <item>P. J. Burgess</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">The first two named were members of the Stevenson
                            Committee and Sir Stanley Bois was the past Chairman of the Rubber
                            Growers Association. The Committee spent about three weeks in the United
                            States, which time was occupied in conference with leading American
                            manufacturers and in the inspection of the principal rubber
                            manufacturing districts, including New Jersey, Northeastern Ohio, and
                            New England. They also inspected the great automobile manufacturing
                            center in Detroit.</p>
                        <p>The situation was explained fully and frankly to these British
                            representatives and their attention was directed particularly to the
                            fear entertained by our manufacturers that upon the depletion of the
                            then existing stock of crude rubber the continued operation of the
                            Stevenson Scheme would present an ideal situation for speculative or
                            trading interests and would make for abnormally high prices and thus
                            perhaps demoralize, temporarily at least, the rubber manufacturing
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>The British representatives, while careful to explain that they could not
                            speak for their Government, expressed the belief that the restriction
                            scheme gave a sufficient degree of discretionary power to permit the
                            control of any speculative or runaway market conditions and that it was
                            their firm belief that such control would be exercised if the
                            contingency arose. In the report of the British Delegation to their
                            Association, they said, in part (Rubber Growers’ “Bulletin” February,
                            1923, page 71): <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        actual shortage of rubber if America’s requirements come up

                                        speculation and price manipulation would inevitably ensue in

                        <p>Ever since the visit of these British representatives the Rubber
                            Association has supplied the Rubber Growers Association of London, the
                            British Embassy at Washington and the Department of Commerce with a
                            quarterly statement showing the consumption of crude rubber in the
                            United States, and since November 1924 with a monthly statement of the
                            consumption. At all times, therefore, the British growers have been in a
                            position to visualize the actual balance between supply and demand and
                            to see the approach of the serious condition with which we are now
                            confronted.</p>
                        <p>As has been stated above, when the world’s stocks began to reach a low
                            point late in 1924, rubber prices began to rise. When they had passed
                            beyond the established price level of 1s/6d cable negotiations were
                            renewed with Mr. H. Eric Miller, first as the spokesman of the Rubber
                            Growers Association and then as a member of the Stevenson Scheme
                            Committee, and therefore an adviser to the Government. Cables were also
                            exchanged with Lord Stevenson, who was acting as an Aide to the Colonial
                            Office in the restriction matter. Copies of this correspondence are
                                appended<note n="82" xml:id="d197fn82">Not printed.</note> and need
                            no explanation. It appears from them that the American rubber
                            manufacturing industry can look for no relief through this source.</p>
                        <p>As indicative of the present attitude of the British Government, we quote
                            the following Associated Press dispatch of July 13, 1925: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“London, July 13 (AP).—The British Government does not consider
                                    the present price of rubber warrants reconsideration of the
                                    existing ordinance restricting the output of the Malay
                                    Peninsular, W. G. A. Ormsby-Gore, Parliamentary Under Secretary
                                    for the Colonial Office, announced today in the House of Commons
                                    in response to a question.</p>
                                <p>A member had asked whether the present high price of rubber would
                                    likely mean the reconsideration of the present Government
                                    policy.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Ormsby-Gore said the legislation originally was framed to
                                    restrict export, not production. The whole matter always is
                                    under consideration of the Colonial Office, he said.</p>
                                <p>While admitting the present rise in prices was unexpected, he
                                    declared it meant that the amount of rubber for export would be
                                    increased automatically on Aug. 1. But if prices remain at the
                                    present extraordinary high figure, the situation would without
                                    doubt be reexamined. Legislation would be required in the
                                    Straits Settlements, <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0335"

                                    percentage of Aug. 1 by 20 per cent instead of 10.</p>
                                <p>This increase could not be made suddenly without creating a great
                                    disturbance, he explained”.</p>

                        <p>It is apparent from this dispatch that the British Government considers
                            it possible to effect such modification in the restriction scheme as it
                            may deem necessary or wise. It is the view of the special committee
                            appointed for this purpose by the Rubber Association of America that if
                            the British Government could be made to understand fully what the
                            present situation is in the American Rubber manufacturing industry and
                            how the future of that industry is threatened by a continuation of the
                            present operation of the scheme, it would see the desirability and the
                            necessity of relaxing its restrictive provisions.</p>

                        <p>232. Delegation under chairmanship of Frederick C. Hood of Watertown,
                            Massachusetts, representing Rubber Association of America, discussed
                            with me today the situation respecting supply of crude rubber from
                            British possessions under the Stevenson Plan. Price appears to have more
                            than tripled since first of year and supply even at new prices and with
                            additional 10 per centum release expected August 1 considered entirely
                            inadequate. July 16 price quotation $1.15 per pound.</p>
                        <p>Associated Press dispatch London July 13 quotes Ormsby-Gore as announcing
                            that day in House of Commons that if extraordinary prices continue the
                            situation would without doubt have to be re-examined. He added that
                            legislation would be required in Ceylon, Federated Malay States and
                            Straits Settlements.</p>
                        <p>This is a matter of very great concern in this country. Please give it
                            your most careful thought and attention and unless you perceive
                            objection to such a step, seek very early opportunity to press the
                            Foreign Office informally for action to relieve the situation. You will,
                            of course, have in mind the entire absence in the United States alike of
                            export duties and restrictions on production of raw materials, for many
                            of which British manufacturers depend very largely upon this country.
                            You may have occasion to suggest creation of a new committee to examine
                            the situation from a disinterested point of view unlikely to <pb n="254"
                                xml:id="pg_254" facs="0336"/>be found in the Committee which itself
                            proposed the Stevenson Plan. Possibly the most available present aid
                            would be larger release, say 20 per centum instead of the expected 10
                            per centum August 1.</p>

                            <p>A critical situation seems to have arisen as a result of the
                                restriction of rubber exports from Ceylon, the Federated Malay
                                States and the Straits Settlements under the Stevenson Plan. The
                                rubber industry in the United States involves roughly one billion
                                dollars; it consumes more than 70 per cent of the world’s production
                                of rubber, and directly or indirectly gives employment to more than
                                one million persons. The disrupting effect to the industry of the
                                recent advance in prices in the short space of eleven weeks, namely
                                from about one shilling and sixpence <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255"
                                    facs="0337"/>per pound to about four shillings and sixpence, has
                                caused great concern in the United States. It appears that this
                                great advance in prices is due partly to speculation and partly
                                because practically no stocks exist either in London or in the
                                United States; and that unless some relief is afforded a partial
                                closing down of American rubber manufactories is inevitable.</p>
                            <p>It is perhaps useless at this time to go into the question of how the
                                situation might have been avoided as it would merely open up a
                                discussion which can in no way alter the fact that this vast
                                American industry is in jeopardy. To relieve the situation it has
                                been suggested that instead of the ten per cent release of the
                                exports of rubber from the States mentioned which is contemplated
                                under the Stevenson Plan on August 1st, an additional ten per cent
                                release should be made.</p>
                            <p>A delegation of the Rubber Association of America has recently
                                conferred with Mr. Broderick, Commercial Counsellor of the British

                                is understood, have been forwarded to His Majesty’s Government by

                                        policy along the following lines: “The object of the
                                        Government in promoting the Stevenson Act was to stabilize
                                        the price of crude rubber at a price that would best serve
                                        the common interests of the grower and the consumer; this is
                                        still its purpose and it is determined to take such measures
                                        as are necessary to check any undue speculative activity
                                        that would defeat that purpose.</item>
                                    <item>“(Two) That the exportable allowance of crude rubber be
                                        increased by twenty per cent (instead of ten per cent) on
                                        August 1st, 1925.</item>
                                    <item>“(Three) That from now on and until the amount of rubber
                                        in London reaches fifty thousand tons rubber in excess of
                                        the exportable allowance be permitted to be shipped to
                                        bonded warehouses in London for subsequent release within

                                        more elastic by providing for an additional five per cent

                                        increase over one and six and for suitable decreases in
                                        exportable allowances upon decreases in price below one
                                        shilling”.</item>

                            <p>It is essential that the price of rubber should be stabilized at a
                                reasonable figure if the American manufacturer is to continue
                                operations in a normal way and develop to its utmost the use of
                                rubber which, in turn, would encourage and make profitable its
                                growth in a manner which would serve the common interests of both
                                grower and consumer and restore the equilibrium from which the
                                industry has <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0338"/>been thrown.
                                It is believed that the suggestions above mentioned might serve as
                                steps towards restoring this equilibrium.</p>

                                    follows: that the exportable allowance of crude rubber should be

                                    in England reaches 50,000 tons; and that the present plan should
                                    be made more elastic by providing for additional increases and
                                    decreases in the exportable allowance in accordance with

                                <item>In the first instance I would observe that, although at the

                                    even then falling and has since fallen again, with the prospect
                                    of a still further decline. The price to-day is 3s/5d a lb., as
                                    against 4s/6d a lb. some weeks ago.</item>

                                <item>This downward tendency of prices will probably be assisted by
                                    a decision taken at the end of July by the Federated Malay
                                    States Government, acting on legal advice, to release 6,000 tons
                                    of “un-couponed” rubber, i. e., rubber comprising the stocks in
                                    the hands of dealers at a date in 1923 when it was made illegal
                                    to transfer such stocks without covering documents of authority
                                    to export. The effect of this decision is in itself equivalent
                                    to the authorisation of an additional release of approximately
                                    7½% of the standard production of Malaya.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>I would further observe that, while His Majesty’s Government
                                    have not been able to take the exact steps suggested in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">aide-memoire</hi>, a similar result may in
                                    effect be anticipated from the reassessment of the standard
                                    production of rubber estates. As a result of this decision the
                                    maximum rate of assessment has been raised from 400 lbs. to 500
                                    lbs. per acre and additional concessions have been made to small
                                    holders. The Rubber Export Restriction Regulations issued in
                                    October 1922 provided for a scale of export duties of which the
                                    minimum rate is payable if no more than a certain stated
                                    percentage of an estate’s normal (or “standard”) production is
                                    exported. At the inception of the scheme, this figure was placed
                                    at 60% of the standard production and, following the 10%
                                    automatic increase which took place on the 1st instant, it has
                                    now risen to 75% of standard production. As a result, however,
                                    of the revision to which I have referred, a proportion of 75% of
                                    standard production under the new assessment will be equivalent
                                    in fact to a proportion of rather over 80% under the old
                                    assessment. Thus since July last there has in effect been an
                                    increase corresponding to 15% of standard production, in
                                    addition to a release of 6000 tons of rubber representing a
                                    further 7½% of the standard production of Malaya.</item>

                                <item>His Majesty’s Government are confident that the two steps
                                    which I have explained will materially ease the situation. They
                                    regret that they cannot go further than this at the present
                                    moment. It is they believe, very questionable whether the
                                    immediate adoption of the steps recommended in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">aide-memoire</hi> would in fact serve the
                                    purpose intended. For instance, it may be mentioned that the
                                    supply of labor on the rubber plantations has, on account of the
                                    long continued depression of the industry fallen below its
                                    normal strength. Any sudden and unanticipated increase of the
                                    percentage of rubber which may be exported on the minimum duty
                                    would not, therefore, have the effect of increasing the rate of
                                    export until such time as it might <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258"

                                    necessary additional labor from India and elsewhere. For this
                                    two months at least would be required.</item>

                                <item>Again His Majesty’s Government consider that there are grave
                                    objections to any interference with the present scheme until it
                                    has been established beyond doubt that the present abnormal
                                    price is more than a purely temporary development. While giving
                                    all due consideration to the representations and the
                                    requirements of the consuming interest in the rubber industry,
                                    they feel there is no less need to have careful regard for the
                                    reasonable protection of the producers by whose enterprise this
                                    great industry has been built up in quite recent times. The
                                    plantation of rubber on its present extensive lines is, in fact,
                                    a matter of such recent history that the producing companies
                                    have not, in many cases, large reserves of capital to fall back
                                    upon in times of depression. Many of these companies were
                                    virtually exhausted and faced with the necessity of allowing
                                    their estates to go out of cultivation at the critical stage
                                    when the present scheme was introduced for their relief. If no
                                    such relief had been afforded by government action, the
                                    situation for consumers might have been considerably worse than
                                    it is today, since the producing area would, in 1922 and 1923,
                                    have been appreciably restricted by the collapse of a number of
                                    estates and small holdings.</item>

                                <item>I would here draw attention to the fact that during the two
                                    years immediately preceding and following the war the average
                                    price of rubber was approximately 2s – a lb.; for seven out of
                                    the eleven quarterly periods during which the scheme has been in
                                    operation the average price has been below 1s/3d a lb. Thus, for
                                    the larger part of this period consumers have been able to
                                    obtain their supplies at less than the price of 1s/3d to 1s/6d
                                    per lb. which they, in common with the other sections of the
                                    industry, agreed to regard as reasonable; only for the last two
                                    quarters of this period has the average price exceeded 1s/6d per
                                    lb. Judging from the latest estimates of the statistical
                                    position which have been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s
                                    Government, there is every reason to believe that, provided that
                                    the average price of rubber during the next few quarters does
                                    not fall below 1s/6d a lb., any risk of a shortage in the
                                    supplies of rubber on the world’s markets has now passed. The

                                    frankly admitted to me, the inconveniences of which the American
                                    users of rubber complain were not inherent in the Stevenson
                                    scheme but arose out of the speculative attitude adopted by
                                    those users towards the scheme and out of their consequent
                                    failure to make in time steady purchases at the low prices which
                                    prevailed up to so recent a date as the end of last year.
                                    Nevertheless I trust that the measures which His Majesty’s
                                    Government have taken as above described will be found effective

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I spent the week-end at
                            Hatfield with the Salisburys. Among the guests there was Amery, the
                            Colonial Secretary. …</p>
                        <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0342"/>
                        <p>Our particular subject of discussion was the rubber situation. The
                            Stevenson Plan, as you know, comes under Amery’s control. We drifted
                            into the talk quite informally, but it gave me a chance to review the
                            whole subject from our point of view and to say to him that the
                            conditions at home were distinctly bad and showed little hope of
                            improvement. Amery said that if the Plan were now abandoned, the
                            situation, he thought, would be materially worse. I replied that, so far
                            as I was aware, our people did not object to the Plan <hi rend="italic"
                                >per se</hi>, but did feel that its administration had failed to
                            give adequate consideration to our really desperate needs. Amery said
                            that while he recognized that the great bulk of the demand for rubber
                            came from America, other factors must also be kept in mind, and he
                            pointed out that the whole matter was constantly being reviewed by an
                            advisory committee. That gave me the opportunity I had been seeking, and
                            I said that, speaking wholly for myself, it did seem to me that if the
                            Plan was to be worked out satisfactorily, it could only be done with
                            American cooperation and agreement, and I suggested, therefore, the
                            possibility of two representatives of the American rubber interests
                            being on the advisory committee. That would, of course, bring the
                            opposing factors of supply and demand together, and would enable a more
                            adequate consideration of present and future needs and tend directly
                            toward the satisfactory development of the rubber industry as a whole.
                            Amery said that the suggestion was most interesting and that he would
                            like to think it over.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say to you that I made the suggestion wholly personally and
                            on my own initiative, and that Amery understands this fact. I have
                            little hope that the suggestion will be carried out. I am sure, however,
                            that if such a plan could be put into operation, it would remove much of
                            the difficulty since it would enable the American representatives to
                            know at all times the exact market conditions, and so tend at least to
                            remove the suspicions which naturally attach themselves now to any
                            action taken by the British alone. In any event, I want you to know
                            precisely what I said.</p>
                        <p>One word more. Hood, the head of the Rubber Association, cabled me some
                            weeks ago that in their belief a seventy-five per cent, release meant,
                            in fact, only a sixty-five per cent, release. I mentioned this statement
                            casually to Amery, who replied at once that in his opinion rather the
                            reverse was true. The eighty-five per cent, release on November 1st
                            would, he indicated, be made a ninety-five per cent, release on February
                            1st. Amery added that if this full twenty per cent, release had been
                            made on November 1st, it would have resulted merely in a war among the
                            rubber producers, by which the stronger would have hired labor from the
                            weaker in order to take advantage <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261"
                                facs="0343"/>of the situation, and in this way have pushed up wages
                            and, therefore, costs and prices. By making the increase only ten per
                            cent, now, but indicating an intention to add another ten per cent, on
                            February 1st, the effect would be to bring in new labor, especially from
                            China, and leave the wage level substantially undisturbed.</p>
                        <p>If, for reasons of your own, you disapprove of my suggestion of American
                            participation, I would be grateful if you would cable me in order that I
                            may make the fact known to Amery. As I said, however, I doubt if the
                            suggestion will seriously be entertained. There is a basis of national
                            pride in maintaining the present situation and that would likely, I
                            think, make our participation improbable.</p>

                        <p>343. The Rubber Association of America has informed Department that
                            situation is becoming more serious; that situation is speculative in the
                            absence of the following information: (1) Whether Government of Great
                            Britain intends to modify the Stevenson Plan or make it more flexible,
                            and (2) whether when 100 percent is reached restriction will be removed,
                            or whether 100 percent would be taken to mean 100 percent of standard
                            production only.</p>
                        <p>Unless you perceive some objection, make inquiry of Chamberlain,
                            informally and discreetly, regarding attitude of Great Britain on the
                            above. You may also tell him, in your discretion, that your Government
                            would be pleased to know whether any relief measures have been
                            determined upon and that you earnestly hope that the Government of Great
                            Britain, knowing the difficulties of the situation, may be able to take
                            such measures. Cable reply.</p>

                        <p>357. Department’s telegram No. 343 dated November 21. This morning I saw
                            Chamberlain and reminded him that for some months <pb n="262"
                                xml:id="pg_262" facs="0344"/>we had been discussing the rubber
                            situation without much apparent result. I suggested that I would be glad
                            to know if it was the intention of his Government to take no remedial
                            steps. Naturally Chamberlain protested that this was not his
                            Government’s attitude and he informed me that a committee of the Cabinet
                            had been formed as a result of our talk last month, which committee was
                            now actively studying the entire rubber situation. Chamberlain also
                            stated that Colonial Secretary Amery in particular was investigating the
                            Stevenson Plan’s working. I told Chamberlain then that the situation in
                            the United States was really serious, adding that the market apparently
                            was getting into the hands of speculators. The two points raised in your
                            last telegram on this subject were also laid before him, and he
                            carefully noted both, stating that before he left for Geneva early next
                            week he would give me an answer.</p>
                        <p>Chamberlain remarked during our conversation that representatives of the
                            Rubber Association had recently been here and had discussed the
                            possibility of a long-time contract with the proper authorities and that
                            this arrangement was also being considered at the present time. I have
                            no information whatsoever with respect to any such move but I suggest
                            that it would be futile for me to discuss the matter further with
                            Chamberlain if the Rubber Association is now undertaking to start direct
                            negotiations.</p>

                        <p>345. Your letter dated November 9 received. The Government of the United
                            States is opposed to government monopolies of products in any country.
                            It would be inadvisable for the Government of the United States to give
                            recognition to such a monopoly by being represented on the advisory
                            committee or by having Americans represented on it. This being our
                            policy as to all monopolies in all countries, we cannot afford to
                            recognize them by any participation therein. I believe you should inform
                            Mr. Amery of this.</p>

                        <p>358. Department’s telegram number 345, November 24. Work, President of
                            the Goodrich Company, told me following late yesterday:</p>
                        <p>Several months ago Winston Churchill<note n="89" xml:id="d206fn89"
                                >British Chancellor of the Exchequer.</note> proposed to certain
                            persons that a banking syndicate composed chiefly of Americans should be
                            formed to regulate the price of raw rubber. Such a syndicate under the
                            lead of Dillon, Read of New York was formed to cover rubber demands of
                            Fiske, Goodrich, Goodyear and United States. Their representatives, Dunn
                            of Fiske and Erdman of Goodyear, came to England, but found it
                            impossible to work out a satisfactory agreement. Work later joined them,
                            and an entirely new plan was developed, acceptable to these American
                            interests. Dunn has sailed for America to see you to learn if you are
                            willing to inform the Government of Great Britain broadly that a plan
                            acceptable to the Rubber Association will be acceptable to you. The plan
                            in substance contemplates the removal of all restrictions on February 1.
                            Three months later, should the price decline, it shall be supported at
                            the rate of 3 shillings 6 pence a pound, but each succeeding quarter the
                            supporting price shall be reduced 3 pence a pound until the price of 2
                            shillings is reached. This will be regarded as the permanent base price.
                            Stevenson will accept this plan provided the Government of the United
                            States gives its assent; and inasmuch as it will prevent violent
                            fluctuations of price and move the base price steadily downward and is
                            open to all purchasers of rubber, Work and his associates think it
                            should be accepted. Dunn will furnish you with the details. Churchill
                            has assured Work and his associates that much of his interest in plan is
                            based on his desire to strengthen British position in international
                            exchanges. According to Work, Stevenson’s position has been seriously
                            shaken because of our representations. The British apparently will deal
                            with Work only with your approval.</p>
                        <p>This new development has taken me wholly by surprise. In our talk at
                            Hatfield House,<note n="90" xml:id="d206fn90">See letter from Ambassador
                                Houghton to the Secretary of State dated Nov. 9, 1925, <ref

                            that certain American interests had been seeking to purchase rubber on

                            spoke a <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0346"/>little more definitely.
                            Aside from this I have received no information at all regarding the
                            formation of an American syndicate to control the entire rubber supply
                            or that negotiations to that end had been carried on for several months.
                            Whether the same is true of the British Foreign Office I cannot say.
                            Would it not be advisable for me to inform Chamberlain that the
                            Government of the United States is wholly without information regarding
                            this movement?</p>

                                these negotiations of rubber interests. You may so inform British

                                rubber or any other commodity. Furthermore, participation by
                                American citizens would certainly be a violation of the spirit if
                                not the letter of our anti-trust laws.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I would be glad if you would as soon as possible take occasion informally
                            to explain to Chamberlain our views in a much wider sense than the
                            question of rubber. We believe that the whole fabric of international
                            commerce and even of wholesome international relations may be undermined
                            unless a halt can be called to governmental price fixing of commodities
                            in international trade. And we believe that Great Britain and the United
                            States, the two greatest importers of raw materials, have the most to
                            lose by such a development. At the present time the price of some 12
                            different commodities is being fixed by direct or indirect governmental
                            action, and price fixing in at least two more important commodities is
                            now in process of negotiation between different governments, in both of
                            which American and British industry and consumers will be the sufferers.
                            Moreover, the apparent success of price fixing in rubber has given great
                            strength to the movement along similar lines among American cotton
                            growers and among other American agricultural industries where the costs
                            of production have been inadequately met by world prices. If our
                            government becomes a party to such practices as to imports it cannot
                            consistently refuse to allow such combinations upon our own soil. This
                            trend in <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0347"/>international commerce
                            cannot fail to increase unless the great trading nations unitedly oppose
                            it. Recently an attempt to finance the coffee price-fixing in São Paulo
                            with American capital was prevented by our government in the interest
                            not only of our consumers but of those of the rest of the world.<note

                            felt that it was a primary duty to discourage international combinations
                            to fix prices from becoming interlocked with international finance,
                            although we understand that British financiers may supply the capital
                            wanted to continue this combination. We have the same situation in
                            potash.</p>
                        <p>We do not come to our conclusions solely from the above reasons. It
                            appears to us that the very fact of discussions between ourselves and
                            Great Britain upon rubber prices is but an indication of the inevitable
                            result of governmental price fixing in that the discussions; which
                            should be kept to the markets, will be at once elevated into
                            international negotiations between governments with the addition of
                            innumerable conflicts and arousal of bitter public sentiments upon all
                            sides. Moreover, we know that in the long run industry itself will not
                            develop efficiently or wholesomely under price fixing. It discourages
                            progress in production methods, stifles consumption, increases the use
                            of less efficient substitutes, stimulates abnormal production in
                            non-price-fixing areas where production cannot exist on a sound economic
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>It would seem to us a most forward step in the progress of international
                            trade and world welfare if the British Government would join with us in
                            discouraging such combinations and the financing thereof. This would, of
                            course, imply the abandonment of the rubber control in respect to which
                            our conclusion is that the world outlook, both consumption and
                            production, makes profitable prices to planters a certainty for many
                            years to come and no such control is longer necessary.</p>
                        <p>Our government trusts these considerations may appeal to the British
                            Government as put forward in every sincerity and in the interest of the
                            world as a whole.</p>

                        <p>372. Your 352, December 1, 3 p.m. Saw Chamberlain late yesterday and made
                            statement as directed.</p>
                        <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0348"/>
                        <p>Chamberlain said very frankly that he too had known nothing of the
                            negotiations being carried on by certain American[s] until just before
                            he had spoken to me. He does not know whether negotiations were
                            initiated by Churchill or by the Americans, but in any event, he says
                            his Government can hardly be supposed to have knowledge of American law
                            and to determine whether or not persons applying to it are within their
                            legal rights.</p>
                        <p>Chamberlain went on to say he had promised me an answer before he left
                            for Geneva and that he had put his answer in the form of an <hi
                                rend="italic">aide-memoire</hi> and that he thought on the whole he
                            had better make the answer as he had originally planned. He then read me
                            the following statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In view of the continued high prices of rubber His Majesty’s
                                    Government have decided that the exportable percentage of rubber
                                    from Ceylon and Malaya on the first February next shall be
                                    raised 15 points to 100 percent of the standard production
                                    instead of to 95 percent which would be the normal figure on
                                    that date under the rubber export restriction regulations. This
                                    constitutes the maximum measure of relief which can be made
                                    effective in the time and it will in fact be equivalent to the
                                    virtual suspension of the existing restriction on exports of
                                    rubber.</p>
                                <p>It may further be stated for the very confidential information of
                                    the United States Government that the above represents an
                                    interim measure pending the probable introduction of a modified
                                    scheme which has for some time been engaging the earnest
                                    consideration of the authorities. Various proposals for a
                                    modification of the existing scheme have been studied with a
                                    view of meeting the present abnormal situation. The advisory
                                    committee over which Lord Stevenson presides has already been in
                                    consultation on this subject with the more important United
                                    States rubber-using interests and His Majesty’s Government are
                                    now awaiting a further expression of the views of those
                                    interests before finally reaching a decision. A certain amount
                                    of delay is naturally entailed by this consultation but every
                                    effort is being made to hasten the proceedings.</p>
                                <p>The United States Government will readily agree that to give any
                                    publicity to the fact that a revision of the scheme of
                                    restriction is under consideration would create extraordinary
                                    difficulties in the rubber market and could only do harm to all
                                    concerned until such time as the new arrangements have been
                                    definitely settled.</p>
                                <p>The advisory committee have expressed themselves as most willing
                                    in the future to meet the representatives of the United States
                                    rubber industry in informal conference either at periodic
                                    intervals or whenever the representatives in question may find
                                    it convenient to come to this country for the discussion of
                                    matters of mutual interest.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>When Chamberlain finished reading he said again that this was the answer
                            he had originally planned to make but that in view of my representations
                            this answer need not now necessarily be regarded as final. He stated
                            frankly that he thought there was little hope that his Government would
                            change their position. He believed the plan <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267"
                                facs="0349"/>was useful and perhaps necessary to enable rubber
                            production under proper conditions and he pointed out that the laws
                            controlling and restricting output are local laws enacted in Ceylon or
                            the Malayan States and the like.</p>

                        <p>Chamberlain leaves for Geneva tomorrow. I fancy, therefore, some weeks
                            will elapse before any reply is vouchsafed.</p>
                        <p>Official notice has been received today that percentage of rubber for
                            export for the quarter beginning February 1st next will be raised by 15

                            proposed arrangement between the Internal Revenue authorities of the
                            United States and Great Britain with a view to granting relief from
                            double income taxation in cases where the profits arising from the
                            business of shipping are chargeable to both British income tax and to
                            income tax payable in the United States, I have the honor to inform you
                            of the receipt of a letter on the subject from the Secretary of the

                        <p>It appears therefrom that Section 213(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of
                            the Revenue Act of 1921 which has been reenacted as Section 213(<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1924 exempts from
                            tax so much of the income of a nonresident alien or foreign corporation
                            as is derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the
                            laws of a foreign country if that foreign country in turn exempts from
                            tax so much of the income of a citizen of the United States nonresident
                            in such country and of a corporation organized in the United States as
                            is derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the
                            laws of the United States. The question of the exemption from tax of
                            income derived from the operation of British vessels has, as the Embassy
                            has observed, previously been discussed by officials of the <pb n="268"
                                xml:id="pg_268" facs="0350"/>Treasury Department with Sir Percy
                            Thompson, Deputy Chairman of the British Board of Inland Revenue, who
                            came to the United States for that purpose. I am informed that these
                            discussions proved fruitless because Sir Percy Thompson did not feel at
                            liberty to recede from the British position that the taxability of a
                            corporation as a resident of the United Kingdom should depend not upon
                            the place of incorporation but upon the place “where its real business
                            is carried on and that …<note n="97" xml:id="d209fn97">Omission in the
                                original note.</note> is carried on where the control and management
                            of the company abide”. (<hi rend="italic">American Thread Company</hi>
                            v. <hi rend="italic">Joyce</hi>, 6 T.C. 163, 164.)</p>
                        <p>The navigation laws of the United States require that a corporation
                            owning a vessel of the United States be a corporation organized in the
                            United States and that its president and managing directors be citizens
                            of the United States, but there is no requirement that the president and
                            managing directors be residents of this country. It was conceivable
                            therefore that the president and managing directors might reside in the
                            United Kingdom, hold their meetings there, and there exercise control of
                            the corporation. In such a case the corporation would, under British
                            law, have been deemed a resident of the United Kingdom and as such
                            subject to tax upon all its income. It is equally clear, however, that
                            such a corporation would be a corporation organized in the United States
                            and deriving income from the operation of a ship or ships documented
                            under the laws of the United States, and would as such be entitled to
                            exemption from British tax upon income derived from the operation of
                            vessels of the United States, if the exemption offered by Great Britain
                            were to be deemed equivalent to that offered under American law.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that the proposal which the British Government now makes
                            in its suggested draft of a Declaration in Council<note n="98"
                                xml:id="d209fn98">Transmitted as an enclosure to the British
                                Embassy’s note No. 138 of Feb. 11, 1924; not printed.</note> does
                            not require that the American corporation shall operate its business
                            outside the United Kingdom in order to be entitled to exemption from
                            British income tax. The British Government proposes, according to the
                            understanding of the Secretary of the Treasury, to exempt from British
                            income tax (including super-tax) “any profits accruing from the business
                            of shipping carried on with ships documented under the laws of the
                            United States to a citizen of the United States resident outside the
                            United Kingdom or to a corporation organized in the United States”. Upon
                            the explicit understanding that the American corporation is thus
                            exempted regardless of whether it does business in the United Kingdom or
                            has an office or place of <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0351"

                            Kingdom and the control of the corporation is there exercised, the
                            Secretary of the Treasury is of the opinion that the offer communicated
                            in the Embassy’s note of February 11, 1924, satisfies the requirements
                            of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue Act of
                            1924, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treasury asks that I make clear the fact that the
                            Treasury Department intends to construe Section 213 (<hi rend="italic"
                                >b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1924 as not affording exemption
                            to British subjects or others resident in the British dominions,
                            colonies, dependencies, or possessions, or to corporations organized
                            under and existing by virtue of the laws of the British dominions,
                            colonies, dependencies, or possessions, unless the laws of such
                            dominions, colonies, dependencies, or possessions grant an equivalent
                            exemption to citizens of the United States and to corporations organized
                            in the United States. The exemption from tax of income derived from the
                            operation of ships of British registry will be confined to individuals
                            resident in the United Kingdom, other than citizens of the United
                            States, and to corporations organized under and existing by virtue of
                            the laws of the United Kingdom.</p>

                            consideration has been given to the Order in Council dated November 7,
                            1924, and to the statements contained in your note above mentioned, and
                            that it has been decided that Great Britain satisfies the equivalent
                            exemption provisions of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of
                            the Revenue Act of 1921. Reference is also made to the Act of Congress
                            approved June 2, 1924, known as the Revenue Act of 1924, which contains
                            the provision relating to taxation for 1924 and subsequent years. The
                            provisions of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue
                            Act of 1924 are identical in terms with the corresponding section of the
                            Revenue Act of <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0355"/>1921. It is
                            therefore held that Great Britain satisfies the equivalent exemption
                            provisions of Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8) of the Revenue
                            Act of 1924.</p>
                        <p>It has also been determined that the exemption from Federal tax under
                            this holding shall be deemed to be effective from May 1, 1923, the date
                            stipulated by your Government as the date from which the exemption
                            applies under British laws to the income of American citizens not
                            resident in the United Kingdom and corporations organized in the United
                            States, derived from the operation of ships documented under the laws of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Reference is also made to the last paragraph of Mr. Grew’s note dated
                            August 11, 1924, setting forth the construction to be placed upon
                            Section 213 (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) (8). In the last paragraph of
                            your note No. 1106 dated November 18, 1924, you stated that “the Irish
                            Free State in common with the other British Dominions” was not to be
                            considered as affected by the Order in Council. Accordingly the
                            exemption from Federal taxation in the United States will be applied on
                            the basis of this understanding.</p>

                                printed.</note> I have the honour, under instructions from His
                            Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform
                            you that it has been duly noted that the United States regulations do
                            not now require American ships to be equipped for using the 300 metres
                            wave and that it would seem clear, therefore, that the suggestion in
                            your note under reference for the use of the wave on American ships to
                            be permitted regionally in British waters was merely put forward by the
                            United States Government with a view to meeting what was understood to
                            be the views of His Majesty’s Government. I am to point <pb n="274"
                                xml:id="pg_274" facs="0356"/>out that the 300 metre wave is used
                            principally in European waters by fishing vessels and other small craft,
                            and it would be impracticable satisfactorily to define the areas in
                            which the wave might be employed. As its use even by such ships may in
                            the near future be abolished, His Majesty’s Government are of opinion
                            that it is now unnecessary to qualify the prohibition in regard to
                            United States ships in British waters.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government are in agreement with the opinion expressed in
                            the penultimate paragraph of Mr. Hughes’ note on the subject of December
                            9th last<note n="1" xml:id="d215fn1">Not printed.</note> to the effect
                            that the proposed reciprocal arrangement can be concluded by an exchange
                            of notes, and I am accordingly authorized to inform you that subject to
                            any modifications which may be agreed to internationally at the next
                            International Conference on Radiotelegraphy, ships registered in Great
                            Britain and Northern Ireland will, from October 1st next, be prohibited
                            from using the waves of three hundred and four hundred and fifty metres
                            within two hundred and fifty miles of the coasts of the United States on
                            condition that United States ships will, from October 1st next, be
                            similarly prohibited from using those waves within two hundred and fifty
                            miles of the coasts of the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the conclusion of a similar arrangement between Canada and
                            Newfoundland on the one hand, and the United States on the other, I have

                            in receipt of a telegram from my Government to the effect that an order,
                            dated 23rd December, 1924, has been promulgated by my Government whereby
                            the landing in England or Wales of potatoes grown in the United States
                            is prohibited. I am advised that this Order has been issued under the
                            provisions of the British Destructive Insects and Pests Acts of 1877 and
                            1907 and the object of the measure is to prevent the introduction into
                            Great Britain of the Colorado beetle. I am informed, also, that although
                            the Order takes immediate effect, potatoes which may have been shipped
                            from the United States before 23rd December will not be refused
                            entry.</p>
                        <p>In requesting you to convey this information to the appropriate
                            authorities of the United States Government, I beg to state that I shall
                            be pleased to furnish you with a copy of the text of the Order in due
                            course.</p>

                        <p>488. British Ministry Agriculture order dated December 24 [<hi
                                rend="italic">23?</hi>] prohibits importation into England and Wales
                            of potatoes grown in United States, for prevention introduction of
                            Colorado Potato beetle. Consult Foley, United States Department
                            Agriculture representative, and ascertain whether this or similar order
                            bars importation potatoes from Canada. If Canadian potatoes admitted,
                            make immediately representations to Foreign Office in following sense,
                            emphasizing urgency of matter:</p>
                        <p>The Colorado potato beetle, according to the records of the Department of
                            Agriculture, is and has been long established in Canada. <pb n="278"
                                xml:id="pg_278" facs="0360"/>The situation of Canada regarding this
                            insect seems to be about the same as that of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, it is urged that potatoes grown in the United States be
                            accorded by the British Government treatment similar to that accorded
                            potatoes grown in Canada, and be admitted to England and Wales under the
                            same conditions.</p>
                        <p>It appears that for the first time in many years it has this year been
                            found profitable to export potatoes from Maine to England. The
                            imposition of the British order of December 24 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >23?</hi>] stops this trade, and, if potatoes grown in New Brunswick
                            and other parts of Canada were admitted to England the action of the
                            British Government would appear to constitute discrimination in favor of
                            Canadian potatoes.</p>
                        <p>The United States Department of Agriculture has stationed inspectors at
                            Portland, Maine, to issue the certificates required by the existing
                            British quarantine regulations. Department of Agriculture reports that
                            there is little danger of the transportation of beetle in potatoes
                            coming out of winter storage, especially those passed over screen or
                            mechanical grader. Beetle is not active in winter and does not hibernate
                            in tuber.</p>
                        <p>For evidence of prevalence of beetle in Canada, refer to Tower’s
                            “Evolution in Leptinotarsa”, pages 32, 35, 36; also Bulletin 52,
                            Canadian Department of Agriculture (1905), page 39; also Report of
                            Dominion Entomologist, 1916, page 50.</p>
                        <p>If prohibition continues only few weeks, it will result in cancellation
                            existing and prospective contracts and loss of trade to American
                            shippers. Hence immediate admission American potatoes same terms as
                            Canadian extremely important.</p>
                        <p>In case Canadian potatoes also excluded, make no representations, but
                            report by cable.</p>

                            dealers called at Department today urging removal of embargo. They are
                            discussing matter with the President January 31.</p>
                        <p>United States Department of Agriculture is prepared to inspect potatoes
                            for export and to give certificate of freedom from disease and
                            infestation by beetle. Certificate would follow requirement of British
                            order of 1920.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that either British Minister of Agriculture or
                            responsible official of Ministry informed L. S. Bean and O. G. Bishop,
                            of Presque Isle, Maine, who were in England in December representing
                            Maine growers, that British Government would permit entry shipments
                            accompanied by federal certificate of freedom from infestation. New
                            Brunswick shipments are admitted on such certificates issued, it is
                            understood, only by provincial agricultural authorities.</p>
                        <p>Please call personally at Foreign Office, leave memorandum as to
                            certificates that will be given by United States Department of
                            Agriculture, and urge removal of embargo as obviously discriminatory,
                            and as apparently not justified by health considerations. For data on
                            latter see Department’s telegram No. 37, January 17, 6 p.m.<note n="9"

                            the Secretary of the Navy, to bring to your attention the plans which
                            are now proposed for a cruise of a portion of the American Fleet to
                            Australia and New Zealand during the coming summer.</p>
                        <p>It is at present contemplated that Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, and
                            Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand, will be visited. The units will
                            consist of a cruiser, the Fleet Flagship; a Division of light cruisers;
                            two destroyer squadrons; three battleship divisions, and approximately
                            eleven auxiliary vessels. The present plan contemplates that the Fleet
                            Flagship, a Division of three battleships, a Division of four light
                            cruisers, and two squadrons of destroyers with a light cruiser as
                            flagship, will arrive at Melbourne on July 20 and will remain at that
                            port until August 3, on which date these vessels will proceed to
                            Wellington, arriving there August 8 and departing August 22.</p>
                        <p>The major portion of the battle fleet, consisting of a battleship,
                            Flagship of the Commander in Chief of the battle fleet, and two
                            additional <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0364"/>battleship divisions
                            comprising six battleships, will arrive at Sydney July 18, departing
                            August 3rd. It will arrive at Auckland August 7, and will remain until
                            August 24.</p>
                        <p>The disposition of the auxiliary vessels of the Fleet will be determined
                            by the current needs existing at that time, and certain of these vessels
                            will visit each of the four ports in question.</p>
                        <p>If the Commander in Chief of the Fleet finds it feasible within the time
                            limit and with regard to overhauling, provisioning, and fueling, he may
                            be able to detail vessels to visit Adelaide, Hobart, Brisbane, Dunedin
                            and Christchurch.</p>
                        <p>In view of the large number of ships concerned, the Secretary of the Navy
                            states that he would be pleased to receive any comment that the
                            appropriate Australian and New Zealand authorities may desire to make in
                            this connection in order that such modifications in the schedule as may
                            appear desirable and practicable may be made in ample time.</p>

                            many as possible thereof, preference being decided in accordance with
                            the size of populations of the various cities. If it should be found
                            impossible to amend the programme to this extent, the Commonwealth
                            Government would suggest that arrangements be made for the fleet to
                            steam in close to the shore wherever practicable.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Australia have requested me to point out that the
                            arrival of that portion of the fleet detailed to visit Sydney at the
                            port in question two days before the Melbourne squadron reaches its
                            destination is likely to prove embarrassing, as, in their opinion, it is
                                <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0365"/>most undesirable that any
                            of the visiting warships should touch at an Australian port before the
                            arrival of a division at the seat of the Federal Government. In view of
                            the importance attached to this question by the Commonwealth Government,
                            I would express the earnest hope that the interested authorities of the
                            United States will be disposed to take action so as to ensure that
                            disembarkation is carried out at Melbourne some hours earlier than at
                            Sydney, more especially as the Commonwealth Government will then be in
                            session. I am further to point out that if the suggestions contained in
                            this paragraph are carried out, the necessary landing and reception
                            arrangements would be greatly facilitated.</p>
                        <p>I have the honour to request that the Admiral Commanding-in-Chief be
                            advised to conduct all correspondence relative to the reception of the
                            fleet at Melbourne etc., through the Prime Minister’s department, as it
                            is considered that this will avoid all overlapping and confusion.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful to receive in due course an expression of your views
                            upon the contents of this note, for communication to the Government of
                            Australia.</p>

                            observations on behalf of the Australian Government regarding the plans
                            for the proposed visit of a portion of the American Fleet to Australia
                            and New Zealand next summer.</p>
                        <p>The comments of the Secretary of the Navy on the points raised in your
                            note have now been received.</p>
                        <p>With regard to visits to Australian ports other than Melbourne and
                            Sydney, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, after a recent conference
                            in San Francisco with Mr. Elder,<note n="11" xml:id="d232fn11"
                                >Australian Commissioner in the United States.</note> has now
                            determined upon the following itinerary, which has been arranged with a
                            view to meeting, as far as possible, the courteous suggestions of
                            Australian and New Zealand authorities, and at the same time having due
                            regard to the requirements of the Fleet.</p>
                        <p>One section of the Fleet will arrive at Melbourne on July 23. It will
                            consist of the Fleet Flagship, one division of three battleships, one
                            division of four light cruisers, and two destroyer squadrons, comprising
                                <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0366"/>twenty-eight destroyers
                            with a light cruiser flagship. This section will proceed to Wellington,
                            New Zealand, on August 6, with the exception of the division of four
                            light cruisers, which will depart from Melbourne on August 3, visiting
                            Hobart from August 5 to August 7, and arriving at Wellington, along with
                            the other vessels of this section, on August 11.</p>
                        <p>The other section of the Fleet will arrive at Sydney on July 23,
                            remaining until August 6, when it will proceed to Auckland, New Zealand.
                            This section will consist of the Flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of
                            the Battle Fleet, and two battleship divisions, eight battleships in
                            all. It will arrive at Auckland August 11, and depart therefrom August
                            25.</p>
                        <p>The auxiliaries of the Fleet, about eleven in number, will be distributed
                            in accordance with then existing needs.</p>
                        <p>You will observe that, in accordance with the desire of the Australian
                            Government, arrival at Melbourne and Sydney will be on the same date. It
                            has further been arranged to have the detachment for Melbourne arrive at
                            a prior hour on July 23.</p>
                        <p>The Commander-in-Chief will be advised to conduct all correspondence
                            relative to the reception of the Fleet at Australian ports through the
                            Prime Minister’s Department. Further, the suggestion of the Australian
                            Government relative to steaming as close to the shore as practicable
                            will be forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief. The Secretary of the Navy
                            expresses the belief that the latter will follow this suggestion, having
                            in view the necessities of the Fleet, the local hydrographic conditions
                            and the weather prevailing at the time.</p>

                                <p>“I have received with appreciation the cordial message you have
                                    sent me on behalf of the Government and people of Australia on
                                    the occasion of the visit of the American Fleet. I know that the
                                    people of Australia join with the people of the United States in
                                    their purpose of maintaining the peace of the world. This, I
                                    believe, can best be secured through a full and sympathetic
                                    understanding between the nations, through faith in their
                                    honorable intentions, through their common determination to
                                    eliminate causes of possible dispute and their integral
                                    fulfillment of international obligations. In questions touching
                                    the great region of the Pacific, I am sure that our aims will
                                    always be similar, that with the assistance of the other nations
                                    which look out on the Pacific peace will be so clearly the
                                    established order that it will become a beneficent tradition. It
                                    is my earnest hope that this visit of the fleet will draw more
                                    closely the bonds of friendship between our two commonwealths
                                    that through the understanding so developed it will strengthen
                                    our common will for peace. Signed Calvin Coolidge”.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary of State</hi>: I have the honor to
                            inform you that the Hellenic Government has concluded a contract with
                            Ulen and Company, an American organization, for the construction of a
                            waterworks system for the cities of Athens and The Piraeus.</p>
                        <p>For the execution of this contract, Ulen and Company must float for the
                            Greek Government a loan of $10,000,000.</p>
                        <p>The Hellenic Government proposes to offer as security for the service of
                            this loan the money which will be paid by the inhabitants of Athens and
                            The Piraeus for the water which is to be furnished them and also a
                            mortgage on the works which are to be constructed. Although these rights
                            constitute sufficient security for the service of this loan, the
                            Hellenic Government is prepared to offer as subsidiary security for the
                            same purpose, the surplus of the revenues affected to the service of the
                            public debt which are under the control of the International Financial
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>In view, therefore, of the stipulation in Article 4 of the financial
                            convention signed at Paris in February 1918,<note n="1" xml:id="d235fn1"

                            the honor to ask you to grant this assent in order that the Hellenic
                            Government may proceed as soon as possible to the settlement of this
                            question which is of a vital interest for the two largest cities of

                            which the Greek Government desires to offer for the service of the loan

                        <p>176. (1) On December 22, 1924, Ulen and Company, of New York, concluded
                            with the Greek Government a contract for the construction of waterworks
                            for the cities of Athens and Piraeus. Under this contract, which was
                            ratified by the Greek Parliament on April 3, 1925, bonds to the amount
                            of $10,000,000 are to be issued by the Greek Government secured in the
                            manner described in Article 19 of the Contract substantially as follows:

                        <p>Under a subsidiary contract for provisional waterworks construction
                            signed later and not requiring Parliamentary ratification, bonds to the
                            amount of $1,000,000 are to be issued, ranking after the service of the
                            bonds for $10,000,000 as a charge upon the same security. On April 15
                            and May 7, 1925, the Greek Government, through its Minister at
                            Washington, acting in pursuance of the Loan Agreement of 1918, requested
                            the assent of the United States to the pledging of the security
                            specified in the contracts with Ulen and Company. Requests of the
                            British and French Governments are understood to have been made at the
                            same time.</p>
                        <p>(2) In view of the urgent need of improved waterworks for Athens and
                            Piraeus, particularly under the conditions resulting from the large
                            accession of refugees, and in view of the fact that the payments of
                            principal and interest of the contemplated loans will apparently be met
                            out of the revenues to be derived from the operation of the waterworks,
                            the Department under dates of May 5 and 23 communicated to the Greek
                            Legation its assent to the pledging of the security specified in the
                            contracts. The Department is informed that neither <pb n="291"
                                xml:id="pg_291" facs="0373"/>the British nor the French Government
                            has replied to the Greek request for assent to the pledging of this
                            security. It is reported that the British financial house of Hambro,
                            which, in cooperation with Speyer and Company of New York, undertook the
                            flotation of the recent Greek refugee loan, has, presumably for the
                            protection of investors in that loan, made representations to the
                            British Government against compliance by that Government with the Greek
                            request. The Greek Government itself, acting, Ulen and Company believe,
                            at the instigation of the French or British Government, is reported to
                            have requested the International Financial Commission to declare that
                            the bonds to be issued under those contracts must, despite the
                            stipulation in Article 19 (c) of the principal contract, rank, as a
                            charge upon the revenues of the Commission not pledged at the time of
                            the conclusion of the Ulen contracts, after the portion of the Ottoman
                            Public Debt to be allocated to Greece and presumably to be charged upon
                            the revenues of the Commission under Article 48 of the Treaty of
                                Lausanne.<note n="5" xml:id="d241fn5">Treaty of July 24, 1923,

                        <p>Ulen and Company inform the Department that they are ready, if necessary,
                            to execute formal assurances with respect to withholding their half of
                            the bonds from the market for two or even three years and that they
                            would use their influence with the Bank of Athens to secure similar
                            action on the part of the Bank. Ulen and Company are not disposed at
                            this time to consider the question of allowing priority to the Greek
                            share of the Ottoman Public Debt as a charge on the revenues of the
                            International Financial Commission remaining unpledged on the date of
                            their contract.</p>
                        <p>(3) The Department desires you to approach the Foreign Office informally
                            and, without requesting any action or the expedition of any action by
                            the British Government, to ascertain what is the present status of the
                            consideration of the question of complying with the Greek request and
                            what may be the factors responsible for the apparent hesitation of the
                            British Government to comply with that request.</p>
                        <p>(4) Repeat foregoing to Paris, Rome and Athens and telegraph cost of
                            repetition to be charged Ulen.</p>
                        <p>(5) Mr. James F. Case, a representative of Ulen and Company, is in London
                            and will call at the Embassy and furnish any explanations which you may
                            desire to have before approaching the Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s Instruction No. 176 of June 6, 1 p.m., relating to a
                            contract concluded by Messrs. Ulen and Company, of New York, with the
                            Greek Government and in which the Embassy was instructed informally to
                            approach the British Government with a view to expediting action on its
                            part in giving assent to the pledging of certain revenues as security to
                            the loan. In this connection, I take pleasure in stating that the matter
                            was informally discussed with the appropriate British authorities and
                            the Embassy was informed on Friday, July 3rd, that the consent of the
                            British Government had been given to the Greek Minister that
                            morning.</p>

                        <p>Mr. James Francis Case, of Ulen and Company, called and said that his
                            only purpose in calling was to express his great appreciation for all
                            that the Department’s officials had been able to do for him in
                            connection with his Company’s negotiations with the Greek Government. He
                            referred in the highest terms to the invaluable assistance which he had
                            received from Mr. Laughlin and also stated that Mr. Atherton in London
                            and that Mr. Whitehouse in Paris had been most helpful in securing the
                            consent of the British and French Governments to the pledging of
                            security by Greece for the Ulen Company loan.</p>

                            repairing the present waterworks system, which he hoped would result in

                            <p>Considering that the time eventually set by the Constitution for
                                legislative elections is near at hand, the Haitian Government deems
                                it imperative to communicate to the Government of the United States
                                the considerations and opinion hereinbelow expressed, which in its
                                opinion, would if applied insure also in the Republic of Haiti the
                                order and stability needed for its general development and afford an
                                effective guarantee of the continuance of the remarkable results
                                already achieved for the progress and prosperity of the Republic
                                through the frank and loyal cooperation of the two Governments.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government has no hesitancy in declaring that it is
                                sincerely and absolutely convinced that if the legislative Chambers
                                were called at this time the happy state of things that has just
                                been referred to would be really threatened.</p>

                                two Governments to answer a dual objective:</p>
                            <p>On the one hand, not to entrust assemblies born of elections with the
                                law-making of the country until there was a certainty that the
                                political passions having wholly subsided there was no reason to
                                fear there would be in the Chambers elements of agitation and
                                disturbance apt to offer systematic opposition to the achievement of
                                political, administrative and economic ends concerning which a final
                                agreement had been reached by the two Governments through the
                                Convention of 1915.<note n="4" xml:id="d246fn4"><ref

                            <p>On the other hand, only to call upon the voters to exercise their
                                franchise for legislative elections so granted by the Constitution
                                conditionally, when the people would have been sufficiently educated
                                to make it possible to assert that there was a body of voters with a
                                sufficient knowledge of their duties and reasonably prepared for a
                                full unlimited enjoyment of their political rights.</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of the Haitian Government based on judicious
                                observation, it is proper to acknowledge that neither objective has
                                yet, generally speaking, been wholly attained thus far. On account
                                of the lack of means it has not yet been found possible to develop
                                the education of the people so as to put the great majority of the
                                citizens of cities, and particularly of the country, in possession
                                of the intellectual means required for a conscientious and
                                clear-sighted use or exercise of the franchise.</p>
                            <p>In this connection an idea may be formed from the city elections
                                which the Constitution of 1918 maintains with the very object of
                                forming an accurate estimate through repeated experiments every two
                                years of the problem of the voting attitude in the country.</p>
                            <p>These elections have always taken place up to date with a number of
                                voters decidedly below the least optimistic, statistical estimates
                                showing through the anomalous number of voters the slight interest
                                taken as a rule by the Haitian voter in the exercise of his
                                franchise. The voting quorum always was found quite low, so much so
                                that it would be hard to find therein a true expression of the will
                                of the majority of the people whose votes were sought.</p>
                            <p>The legislative elections, if they were to take place in 1926, would
                                coincide with the renewal of the Presidential term and would be
                                imperilled thereby, a feature of extreme unrest caused by the
                                probable excitement of the people. The opposition, whose only
                                platform <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0378"/>it might be said
                                is the overthrow of the state of things created by the Convention of
                                1915, would surely display the greatest activity and bring into play
                                all its resources so as to win a majority in the legislative body
                                and thus bring about the victory of its Presidential candidate. It
                                would find quite an advantage in this undertaking in the
                                indifference of the bulk of the voters hereinabove noted and might
                                very well, thanks to this indifference, gain a privileged, if not
                                prominent situation, in the national Chamber.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government believes that this prospect, resting on a
                                plausible surmise, particularly if a policy of nonintervention in
                                the elections were adopted, must arrest the earnest attention of the
                                two Governments and unite them in the joint concern of warding off
                                the grave consequences which might follow from its being possibly
                                carried out.</p>
                            <p>Insofar as it is concerned, this Government maintains in this respect
                                the opinion it invariably professed heretofore, namely, that the
                                narrow bounds within which the Convention and the Constitution have
                                hemmed the exercise of legislative power, particularly in their
                                budget and financial clauses, will always make it difficult for
                                political assemblies in position to claim a free electoral
                                investiture and a full execution of the diplomatic instrument of
                                1915 to work harmoniously. This opinion is the result of the careful
                                examination made into the deep changes introduced in the traditional
                                relations between the executive and legislative powers by the
                                Convention and the Constitutional provisions which are the
                                unavoidable consequences thereof.</p>
                            <p>The last paragraph of article 55 and article 112 of the Constitution,
                                together with certain provisions of the Convention, particularly
                                those contained in article 9 of the last-named instrument, have as a
                                matter of fact stripped the legislative Chambers of all autonomy in
                                budget and fiscal matters. The initiative in lawmaking, which is
                                granted them by the second paragraph of article 55, is noticeably
                                lessened by the last paragraph under which the initiative as to laws
                                concerning public expenditures is reserved for the executive power,
                                the reason being that laws that do not call for any expenditure are
                                exceedingly rare.</p>
                            <p>Legislative Chambers won to the spirit of opposition will not
                                patiently put up with the passive attitude forced upon them by these
                                restrictions and it is to be presumed that they will constantly be
                                inclined to seek a compensation in an excessive use of the few
                                prerogatives and powers left them going as far as resorting to
                                obstruction should the case arise. The executive power, defenseless
                                and powerless, would be placed in a situation so created with no
                                other alternative than to abdicate or resort to unlawful means.</p>
                            <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0379"/>
                            <p>The first solution which without question would strengthen the
                                despotic tendencies of the Chambers would sanction in advance, so to
                                speak, anything they might undertake to do hereafter as they might
                                see fit against the President’s prerogatives under the cover of the
                                unrest and agitation borne of the Government’s unstable
                                conditions.</p>
                            <p>It may furthermore be safely asserted that if resort were had to
                                violence it would constitute an attempt on legality which would in
                                any event, cause, in Haitian opinion, a disturbance that would be
                                fatal to the real interests of the country.</p>
                            <p>Upon an impartial examination of the threats that a call of the
                                legislative body at this time would offer to the condition of things
                                created by the Convention, and the friendly cooperation of the two
                                Governments, the Haitian Government is also led to give equal
                                consideration to the advantages and resources that the quorum
                                relative to the deliberations of the two Houses of that body, as
                                provided in the Constitution, would not fail to bring to the
                                opponents of the Presidential regime.</p>
                            <p>It appears from article 59 of the Constitution that a majority (one
                                more than one-half) for the Chamber is 19 and 9 for the Senate in
                                the very rare cases when the two Houses would sit with all the
                                members present. Taking into account the unavoidable absences and
                                consequently the corresponding lowering of the figure for the
                                majority, it must be granted that there being in the two Houses
                                minorities including from 14 to 17 members in the Chamber of
                                Deputies and 5 to 7 in the Senate would be enough to place the
                                executive power in the most embarrassing situation, stand in the way
                                of all its recommendations and so paralyze the law-making
                                operations.</p>
                            <p>The Haitian Government in brief believes that all the foregoing
                                considerations are such as to discountenance the recourse to
                                legislative elections because of the certainty of their being
                                attended with disappointment. Taking the best possible aspect of
                                things, in case of legislative actions, it seems to the Government
                                that it would be very difficult even if there was a marked success
                                to secure in the Parliament the majority needed for an effective
                                action against active minorities animated with the spirit of
                                intrigue and ambition.</p>
                            <p>In the face of all these considerations just set forth by it, the
                                Haitian Government is of the firm opinion that upon sober
                                consideration of the present situation of the Republic of Haiti, it
                                is the part of wisdom and prudence for the two Governments firmly to
                                adhere to the policy that has brought forth so many happy results
                                and which the two Governments have thus far applied.</p>
                            <p>The Government means by this a condition of things signalized by the
                                preponderant existence of a strong executive power animated by <pb
                                    n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0380"/>the most benevolent
                                disposition towards a frank and cordial cooperation which must
                                subsist between the two Governments and which alone may meet the
                                necessities daily created by the operation of the Convention and to
                                insure the successful cooperation of that Convention in the
                                achievement of its eminent ends.</p>
                            <p>By the side of that power, it is important to maintain the
                                Legislative Council consisting of specialists, above the sterile
                                call of politics, bound to the executive power in close cooperation,
                                a council, which has unquestionably stood the test, and of which one
                                may expect in adding up the remarkable results already achieved much
                                more in the future for the happiness and prosperity of Haiti.</p>
                            <p>We must not forget, moreover, that an experiment of legislative
                                elections under the Convention was made in 1917 and that it
                                culminated through the hasty and biased attitude of the two Chambers
                                into a violent dissolution which was acknowledged by both
                                Governments to be necessary.</p>

                            the confidential memorandum sent to you by the President of Haiti and
                            referred by you to the Department, expressing the views of the President
                            of Haiti regarding the advisability of holding legislative elections in
                            that country in January, 1926.</p>
                        <p>You may inform President Borno that this Government will interpose no
                            objection should the President of Haiti, acting within his own
                            discretion, conclude that it would be inadvisable to issue a call for
                            legislative elections to be held in January, 1926. It should be made
                            clear that this Government does not wish to express an opinion at this
                            time as to the advisability of holding or not holding the elections, and
                            that it prefers that the President of Haiti should act upon his own
                            responsibility in the matter.</p>
                        <p>While appreciating the difficulties involved in an attempt to hold
                            popular elections in Haiti under existing conditions, the Department
                            considers that the Government of the United States is obligated by its
                            undertaking to lend an efficient aid for the maintenance of a government
                            adequate for the protection of life, property and individual liberty to
                            assist the Haitian Government in the development of a satisfactory
                            electoral system, which is indispensable to the maintenance of a stable
                            government in a country whose constitution is based upon republican
                            principles. The Department desires, therefore, that a plan should be
                            formulated for the reform of the existing electoral legislation <pb
                                n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0381"/>in Haiti and that adequate
                            legislation should be drafted to govern the communal elections which are
                            now held, and to govern the national elections when it is considered
                            advisable to hold such elections. The Department will be glad to have
                            you prepare a plan for the establishment of a proper electoral
                            system.</p>

                        <p>37. Department’s No. 27, July 8, 7 p.m. Reaction in Haiti to sending
                            expert on electoral matters would be unfavorable, in my opinion, with
                            both Government and Opposition. Latter would resent the sending of
                            another American expert and both factions would think any one not
                            thoroughly familiar with Haitians and conditions here incompetent to
                            undertake solution of problem. I believe that last March President Borno
                            informed the High Commissioner that for these reasons he would oppose
                            the sending of an expert.<note n="6" xml:id="d250fn6">Marginal notation:

                                <item>Prior to the Constitution of 1918, the election law in force
                                    was that of August 24, 1872, which was reproduced in the <hi
                                        rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>
                                    <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0383"/>numbered 47 of the year
                                    1902. With the going into effect of the Constitution of 1918, it
                                    was found necessary to enact a new election law which, although
                                    it does not specifically revoke the law of 1872, nevertheless,
                                    completely takes its place. We have, therefore, no reason to
                                    refer to any law back of the law of August 4, 1919.<note n="7"

                                <item>The Constitution of 1918 differs little from its predecessor,
                                    that of 1889, in regard to elective officers, and the manner of
                                    their election to office. It prescribes, however, that the first
                                    elections for an elective legislature will be held on an even
                                    year, fixed by decree of the President. (Article C—Transitory
                                    Provisions). Until such decree is issued, there can be no
                                    elections other than those for communal officers. For this
                                    reason it seems advisable that a communal election law be
                                    enacted which would serve as a model for a general election law,
                                    covering the election of deputies and senators, upon the
                                    issuance of the decree of the President calling for the election
                                    of a constitutional legislature.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Another thing that the new Constitution did, was to omit all
                                    the qualifications of citizenship, included in the Constitution
                                    of 1889, making them a matter for legislation. (Article 3).
                                    Therefore, the first chapter of the law of 1919 is devoted to
                                    the qualification of citizenship. The new Constitution included
                                    two qualifications for the exercise of political rights, as
                                    follows: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that all the voters must be
                                    twenty-one years of age; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that all
                                    naturalized citizens must have not less than five years
                                    residence in Haiti before they can vote. (Article 6).</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>It may be remarked here that Article 4 of the law of 1919 is
                                    an interpretation of Article 6 of the new Constitution, insofar
                                    as it assumes to make the five year period run from the date of
                                    naturalization. It is, therefore, of questionable
                                    legality.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Article 5 of the law of 1919 requires all voters to register,
                                    and Article 6 prohibits a voter from registering on more than
                                    one list of voters. Chapter IV looks after this in greater
                                    particularity. Noteworthy points, however, are that there is no
                                    prohibition against appearing twice on the same list and no
                                    penalty for double registration. The registration is controlled
                                    by the communal officers in power at the time. In other words,
                                    the “outs” have little chance against the “ins”. It is not
                                    necessary to go further to discover reasons why elections under
                                    the law of 1919 are an absurdity. Section 4 of Chapter IV
                                    details the manner of voting, which further indicates that the
                                    voter has no protection, either as to the secrecy of his ballot,
                                    or that it will be cast for the candidate for whom he desires to
                                    vote, it being remembered that there is more than ninety percent
                                    illiteracy among the voters of Haiti.</item>

                                <item>The greatest difficulty in the way of holding fair elections
                                    in Haiti is perhaps due to the fact that there exist no
                                    political parties here. Local election boards must necessarily
                                    control the conduct of elections. In the absence of adequate
                                    representation on such boards by each of the opposing political
                                    factions, coupled with appropriate restrictions as to
                                    registration, voting, and the counting of the ballots, elections
                                    must continue to be what they have been in the past—ridiculous

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Department’s
                            telegram No. 22 [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>] of July 8, 1925, and to your
                            replies by cable and by despatch of July 10 and July 18, respectively,
                            regarding the proposed reform of existing electoral laws in Haiti.</p>
                        <p>The Department has carefully considered the draft of a new communal
                            electoral law submitted by the High Commissioner during his recent visit
                            to Washington, as well as the observations and recommendations on the
                            subject contained in Judge Strong’s memorandum of July 13, 1925, which,
                            together with copies of the law of August 4, 1919, accompanied your
                            despatch. It has also noted the expression of your opinion that it would
                            not be advisable to send to Haiti a person familiar with electoral
                            legislation and procedure, for the purpose of making an investigation on
                            the ground and elaborating a project or projects to meet the needs of
                            the situation in that country.</p>
                        <p>The Department was unable to give its entire approval to the draft of the
                            new electoral law submitted by the High Commissioner and, inasmuch as it
                            is now too late for this law to be enacted and go into effect in time
                            for it to be used in the communal elections next January, it is thought
                            best that these elections be held under the existing law, that of August
                            4, 1919.</p>
                        <p>However, as this law contains certain serious defects, it would seem to
                            be best that it should be modified and amended before the <pb n="303"
                                xml:id="pg_303" facs="0385"/>next elections and the following
                            alterations and additions are suggested as desirable: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>A provision penalizing the multiple registration of voters on
                                    the same list.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Provisions setting forth the penalties applicable to
                                    violations of the law.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Modification of Article 36 to permit an illiterate voter to
                                    select a literate person of his own choosing to accompany him to
                                    the polls and to fill in his ballot. (In its present form this
                                    Article provides that the duties of amanuensis shall devolve
                                    upon members of the electoral boards.)</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Increase in the number of registration boards. (Article 13 of
                                    the present law provides that registration of voters shall take
                                    place only in the “Hôtel Communal” of each commune.)</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Modification of Article 45 to permit the presence at the polls
                                    of representatives of each candidate for office to witness the
                                    conduct of the voting; and to give to each candidate the right
                                    of appeal to the district verification boards from the decisions
                                    of the communal boards.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The foregoing list of suggested modifications should not be regarded as
                            exclusive. Others will probably occur to you as desirable and you will
                            of course incorporate them in such recommendations as you may feel
                            called upon to make in response to this instruction.</p>
                        <p>It is thought that a new electoral law along the lines of that recently
                            submitted by the High Commissioner, but with certain modifications and
                            amendments, can be worked out and enacted in the course of the coming
                            year, thus allowing plenty of time for the people of Haiti to become
                            acquainted with its provisions and prepared to use it in the elections
                            of 1928.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed to call the attention of President Borno to the
                            advisability of amending the electoral law of August 4, 1919, in time
                            for it to be used in amended form in the communal elections of January
                            1926, and discuss with him the changes suggested above. It is desired
                            that you then report to the Department in detail the President’s views
                            as well as your own.</p>

                        <p>54. Department’s No. 37, October 1, 2 p.m. President Borno had informed
                            me he did not intend making public statement of his reasons for
                            deferring the elections.</p>
                        <p>I think that the issuance of a statement before October 10 along lines
                            indicated in Department’s telegram No. 37 would have excellent effect.
                            Accordingly, I suggested taking such action to President Borno and on
                            morning of October 3 he informed me that he would publish statement
                            along lines I had suggested, but no statement has appeared. If by
                            October 8 no action has been taken, I shall again suggest advisability
                            of issuing public statement. Any statement President Borno may make will
                            be telegraphed to the Department.</p>

                                as you know, is governed entirely by a sentiment of absolute
                                sincerity. Having decided to spare no effort in organizing our
                                democracy, firm and prosperous, in order and in liberty, the
                                Government has for its first duty to consider the country as it is,
                                to place itself resolutely before the reality of facts, and not to
                                permit itself to be led astray by any empty declamations, by any

                                        succeeded each other! The last, Vilbrun Guillaume, had just
                                        been violently torn from the French Legation, and sacrificed
                                        in the street by the blind and barbarous anger of a mob
                                        which had been exasperated by the unattoneable slaughter at
                                        the prison of Port-au-Prince.</p>
                                    <p>The American Intervention put an end to this scandal, and the
                                        same National Assembly which, under the pressure of a
                                        victorious force, had ratified three “coups d’Etat” by
                                        electing successively three revolutionary chiefs, this same
                                        National Assembly, acting for the first time in its full and
                                        complete freedom, called to the first magistracy, Senator
                                        Dartiguenave. It was necessary henceforth, to secure in the
                                        ruined and blood-stained Republic, order and peace,
                                        security, a stable government, every condition in a word
                                        indispensable to work, to normal living, indispensable to
                                        the well being and the prosperity of the citizens. And the
                                        proof was given, definitely given, of the complete impotence
                                        of the leading nationals, too divided among themselves, to
                                        procure for this country these basic conditions.</p>
                                    <p>The convention was then signed consecrating to the profit of
                                        the Republic of Haiti the powerful aid of the American
                                        Government.</p>
                                    <p>That was certainly a sacrifice to national self-respect. But,
                                        between this sacrifice and the life of shame, misery, and
                                        ignominy from which it had rescued us, no citizen, having a
                                        true sense of national honor, could hesitate.</p>
                                    <p>And since then what have we seen? Peace, inestimable benefit,
                                        has been reestablished. The laboring people have been able
                                        to devote themselves to their work; thanks to the order
                                        maintained everywhere, they have been able to realize from
                                        our agricultural potentialities the greatest advantages. The
                                        work of rehabilitation and sanitation, undertaken by degrees
                                        everywhere, has facilitated communications, benefited <pb

                                        procured at the same time means of sustenance for thousands
                                        of our citizens; for the first time in years, families have
                                        known the joys of security and exercised the prerogatives of
                                        true social liberty.”</p>

                            <p>And I add to-day:</p>
                            <p>More than twelve hundred kilometers of roads have been constructed;
                                new roads are still being opened; numerous bridges have been thrown
                                across the water courses; important irrigation works have been
                                undertaken; a technical service has been instituted to give us at
                                last an organized agricultural system, demanded for over a hundred
                                years; city and rural schools have already been built and a
                                progressive program of school work is in operation; new laws have
                                put into the hands of the authorities means of protecting the
                                peasants against the despoiling methods of a certain class of rotten
                                and heartless lawyers; the fine results of the public health
                                service, in the towns and in the country, have procured, and are
                                procuring each day, invaluable aid to citizens in every walk of
                                life; the national magistracy, so long neglected, has, at last,
                                initiated in its favor, better conditions which will develop in
                                proportion; and the financial credit of the country is so high in
                                foreign markets that it could be said “that it is virtually on the
                                same plane as such conservative states as Holland, Sweden, and
                                Switzerland.”</p>
                            <p>And, nevertheless, if the general situation offers so much
                                satisfaction, how can it be denied that the work accomplished until
                                now is but a beginning, when one considers all that still is left to
                                be done to assure the continued development of agriculture,
                                commerce, public education, health, seriously to guarantee public
                                peace, public and private property, the home, and the security of
                                all, against any possible return to our bad past, our past of bloody
                                and destructive revolutions, scandalous pillage, and by the
                                persecution of exploitations of the peasants by military satrapes,
                                masters of life and property.</p>
                            <p>And before this immense task which solicits, urges, and demands an
                                active coalition of all good wills, what do we see today? Groups of
                                politicians at bay, scattered through different parts of the
                                country, who pretend to oppose the civilizing progress of the
                                government by exerting themselves to create and to develop an
                                agitation purely political under the lying pretext of “restoring
                                democratic institutions”, that is to say, to be exact, to replace
                                the present legislative Council of State by a Chamber and a
                                Senate!</p>
                            <p>You are not ignorant of the fact, Mr. Prefect, that it is the firm
                                design of the present government to realize fully the constitutional
                                provision for the election of the two Legislative Chambers. But at
                                what moment ought this election be brought about, which the
                                constitution itself, in an evident view to prudence and wisdom, has
                                made <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0389"/>dependent upon a
                                special convocation by the President of the Republic? That is the
                                whole question between the Government and its adversaries. These
                                latter say: “Immediately”, that is to say, “on January 10, next.”
                                But the Government, which has no thought of deceiving itself or of
                                deceiving anyone else, replies: No, the Haitien people are not
                                ready. Democracy is the government of the people by conscious,
                                popular suffrage, practiced with the greatest possible liberty. We
                                have that liberty. Never in any period of our country, for more than
                                a century, has there been in Haiti as much liberty as at the present
                                moment. The liberty of circulation is absolute; without any
                                passport, one crosses the country in every sense. The freedom of
                                holding meetings is subject only to a previous notification to the
                                local police. The freedom of the press which is, when summed up, the
                                expression of all the others, is absolute; the law which governs it
                                is made only to suppress abuses, defamation, outrage, provocation to
                                crime, all those intolerable excesses by which the old revolutionary
                                demon, impatient to break his chains, manifests himself from time to
                                time.</p>
                            <p>We have liberty. But where then is our popular conscious
                                suffrage?</p>
                            <p>Our rural population, which represents nine-tenths of the Haitien
                                people, is almost totally illiterate, ignorant and poor; although
                                its material and moral situation has been appreciably bettered in
                                these last few years, it is still incapable of exercising the right
                                of vote, and would be the easy prey of those bold speculators whose
                                conscience hesitates at no lie.</p>
                            <p>As for the town population, one-tenth of the total population, those
                                of its members who are capable of expressing an intelligent vote,—a
                                little progressive minority formed of peaceful men, business men,
                                artisans, citizens of different professions, belonging to different
                                social classes,—have for a long time, for the most part, renounced
                                their electoral right, disgusted by the immoral maneuvers and the
                                insolent frauds which render, and would still render illusory their
                                efforts as intelligent electors. The remainder is the small group of
                                professional politicians, with their followers of every sort, who
                                are mainly illiterate.</p>
                            <p>That is the present electoral body! It is characterized by an
                                absolute lack of organization as to the little number of its useful
                                elements, and, for the rest, by a flagrant inability to assume, in
                                the decisive period through which we are passing, the heavy
                                responsibilities of a political action.</p>
                            <p>Popular suffrage has not its <hi rend="italic">raison d’etre</hi>, if
                                it can only serve to elect individuals and nothing else. True
                                democratic suffrage should serve, primarily, to elect in individuals
                                definite principles, programs of action, and methods of
                                government.</p>
                            <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0390"/>
                            <p>All this amounts to saying, that the rational and necessary
                                foundation of democratic suffrage is, in a conscious electoral body,
                                the organization of parties with platforms.</p>
                            <p>Our national history has only presented up to now two real parties,
                                the National party which extols the principle of a strong executive
                                authority, and the Liberal party, enthused by parliamentarism. Both
                                have disappeared from the political scene through lack of interior
                                discipline and of support by a real public opinion.</p>
                            <p>The Government is working to prepare the way to the intelligent and
                                disciplined democracy, to the solid organization thereof. The
                                present electoral law is recognized by all as incompatible with the
                                sincere expression of popular will. A new law, now in the course of
                                preparation, will be presented at the next Ordinary Session; it will
                                offer all the possibilities for the full functioning of political
                                parties, and for the constitution of an intelligent electoral body,
                                capable of exercising, without danger to the Republic, the sovereign
                                attributes of universal suffrage.</p>
                            <p>And when the hour shall have struck, an hour which will be hastened,
                                let us hope, by the wisdom of our citizens, the President of the
                                Republic will be proud to put into operation the solemn prerogative
                                which the constitution has consigned to his patriotism, his
                                judgement, and his conscience, to fix the date of the legislative
                                elections.</p>
                            <p>Until that time, I advise you, Mr. Prefect, the Council of State will
                                continue to follow the formal provision which, in this same
                                constitution, has delegated to it the functions of the legislative
                                power.</p>
                            <p>And you will take care that the approaching elections of January 10,
                                1926, shall be exclusively communal.</p>

                        <p>In January, 1923, the Minister of Finance at Port-au-Prince requested the
                            Haitian Government to meet the service of its 5 percent <pb n="309"
                                xml:id="pg_309" facs="0391"/>loan of 1910 in gold. The matter was
                            brought to the attention of the Federal Government in a note from Mr.
                            Jusserand of April 10, 1923.<note n="10" xml:id="d256fn10">Not

                        <p>As the question was not settled, the Banque de l’Union Parisienne, one of
                            the banks that issued the loan, applied directly, in November 1923, to
                            the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Haiti and pleading the right
                            derived from Article 30 of the loan contract,<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d256fn11">Text of loan contract printed in <hi rend="italic"

                            be referred to arbitration. This article reads as follows: “The protests
                            that may arise as to the execution of this contract shall be referred to
                            two arbitrators in Paris. …” The representatives of France at Washington
                            and at Port-au-Prince were instructed to support this request at the
                            seats of the Haitian and United States Governments. The question formed
                            in particular the subject of two notes from the Embassy dated June 12
                            and September 5, 1924.<note n="12" xml:id="d256fn12"><ref

                        <p>The Haitian Government offered several arguments in reply to that
                            request, which may be summed up as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) The bondholders who are not parties to the loan contract cannot claim
                            the benefit of Article 30 of that contract;</p>
                        <p>(2) The Union Parisienne being one of the three banks parties to the
                            contract, is not competent to act alone without the other two banks
                            concurring;</p>
                        <p>(3) It is impossible to admit that the Union Parisienne be competent to
                            prefer any claim whatsoever against the Haitian Government in the name
                            of the holders as the 1910 contract does not in any way confer such a
                            right upon it;</p>
                        <p>In its capacity as agent of the Haitian Government the Union Parisienne
                            is under the obligation to act for the interest of the Haitian Republic
                            and not for that of the holders.</p>
                        <p>These arguments have already been met point by point by the French
                            Government in the following manner: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The objection drawn from the fact that the holders are not
                                    parties to the contract of issue and have no claim to the
                                    provisions of that contract, is untenable, since those holders
                                    are no longer concerned, the claim being preferred by a bank
                                    which is a party to the contract;</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>There is nowhere in the contract of issue any mention of the
                                    fact that a claim, in order to be entertained, must be presented
                                    by all three banks acting in accord. In the absence of such
                                    article each one of the contracting parties is at full liberty
                                    to act;</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>It is not necessary to know in whose behalf the Union
                                    Parisienne is acting when it lays its claim before the Haitian
                                    Government. The Union Parisienne acts in its capacity as issuing
                                    bank, party to the contract. In so doing, it serves its own
                                    interests; the commission provided in its favor by the contract
                                    necessarily increases when it is admitted that the service of
                                    the loan must be effected in gold. That the holders of bonds
                                    will profit by the intervention of the Union Parisienne <pb
                                        n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0392"/>is a question of fact,
                                    not of law. On the other hand, no article in the contract
                                    warrants the claim of the Haitian Government that the Union
                                    Parisienne is to be considered as its agent. That bank undertook
                                    certain obligations which are well defined (to take up 130,000
                                    bonds for delivery), in return for which certain advantages,
                                    also well defined, were assured to it (one quarter of one
                                    percent commission); but it did not assume any general
                                    obligation to the Haitian Government, as also it receives no
                                    compensation beyond the commission provided for the service of
                                    the loan. What, moreover, would article 30 of the contract
                                    signify if it could be invoked only by the Haitian
                                    Government?</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>No answer has yet been received to that statement of the French
                            Government either from the Haitian Government or that of the United
                            States. The right of the Union Parisienne to claim the benefit of
                            article 30 is obvious and it is not easily understood why its request
                            has not yet been met. The question for the present is not whether the
                            claim of the Union Parisienne to have the service of the 1910 loan in
                            gold, is or is not well founded. It is merely a question of procedure
                            duly provided by the contract and which the Haitian Government may not
                            decline without ignoring its own signature.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador of France is satisfied that the Department of State,
                            acknowledging that the objections raised by the Haitian Government to
                            the request of the Union Parisienne are untenable, will bring to bear
                            upon it the necessary amount of pressure to cause satisfaction to be
                            given to a claim that is in every respect well founded.</p>

                            to the desire of your Government that the Government of the United
                            States should endeavor to induce the Haitian Government to reconsider
                            its refusal to accept the proposition of the bank of the Union
                            Parisienne to arbitrate the question whether the bonds issued by virtue
                            of the loan contract of September 9, 1910 between the Government of
                            Haiti and the representatives of four banking institutions are payable
                            in gold.</p>
                        <p>In your Embassy’s note of March 31, 1925, it is stated “there is no
                            necessity of finding in whose behalf the Union Parisienne is acting <pb
                                n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0393"/>when it lays its claim before
                            the Haitian Government. The Union Parisienne acts in its capacity as
                            issuing bank, party to the contract. In so doing, it serves its own
                            interests; the commission provided in its favor by the contract
                            necessarily increases when it is admitted that the service of the loan
                            must be effected in gold”.</p>
                        <p>The loan contract in question provides that the bank of the Union
                            Parisienne shall act as the fiscal agent of the Haitian Government for
                            the service of the loan and shall receive a commission upon the amounts
                            expended by the Haitian Government in such service. Therefore it is
                            entirely correct, as stated in your Embassy’s note last mentioned, to
                            say that the material interests of the bank would be subserved by the
                            great increase in the amount which the Haitian Government would be
                            obliged to pay should it be determined that the loan is payable in gold.
                            However, it seems to be an unusual procedure and entirely outside the
                            generally accepted view of an agent’s rights and duties for an agent to
                            seek to compel his principal to increase his expenditures in order that
                            the agent’s commission may correspondingly increase and the Government
                            of the United States is unable to believe that a question of this nature
                            was contemplated in the minds of the contracting parties when they
                            entered into the agreement for arbitration provided in Article 30 of the
                            loan contract with respect to matters arising regarding the performance
                            or execution of the contract. This article provides as follows: <quote

                                    the third arbitrator, this third arbitrator shall be appointed

                        <p>It therefore appears that Article 30 of the loan contract contemplates
                            the submission to arbitration of controversies only regarding the
                            execution of the contract. With respect to this provision as bearing
                            upon the present request of the bank of the Union Parisienne, it may be
                            said that it would seem that this bank, which, as stated, is the fiscal
                            agent of the Haitian Government under the contract, should regard the
                            contract as executed so far as concerns the question of the repayment of
                            the loan when the Haitian Government delivers to it an amount in French
                            francs sufficient to pay the bonds at their face value in such francs,
                            in addition to the commission to which the bank is entitled on such
                            payment. Moreover, it seems clear to me <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312"
                                facs="0394"/>that in making such request the bank is in reality
                            acting as the agent of the bondholders who are not parties to the loan
                            contract and therefore have no standing thereunder to request
                            arbitration of the question under consideration. In this view of the
                            matter it appears to me that the bank is going entirely outside of its
                            province under the loan contract and is presenting a request which the
                            Haitian Government is fully within its rights in rejecting as without
                            any warrant.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing it would not appear essential to enter into
                            further discussion of the matter but there are additional reasons which
                            may be adduced to support the action of the Haitian Government in
                            refusing the request of the bank.</p>
                        <p>As above stated the loan contract was made between the Government of
                            Haiti and four bankers who appear to have been treated as a unit
                            throughout various provisions of the contract. Thus in Article XXIV of
                            the contract the bankers undertake to accept the bonds of the loan of
                            1910 and to pay the Haitian Government therefor forty-seven million
                            francs and in Article XXVI of the contract the bankers reserve the right
                            to issue the loan by public subscription or otherwise. In Article XXIX
                            the bankers are given a preferential right to future loans for a period
                            of twelve years. In all these articles the bankers appear to be treated
                            as a unit, as do they also in Article XXX which relates to the question
                            of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>In view of the last mentioned provisions of the loan contract it would
                            seem to have been the intention of the parties that all of the bankers
                            must act in order to make an effective request for arbitration and not
                            merely one of them as in the case as presented by you. Should the
                            Government of Haiti grant the request of the bank of the Union
                            Parisienne and enter into an arbitration with it on the question
                            presented, it might well be argued that any award rendered would be void
                            since all persons interested in the subject matter of the controversy
                            had not joined in the submission to arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The loan contract in question is presumed to have come into effect so far
                            as the Government of Haiti is concerned by the law of ratification which
                            was passed by the Haitian legislature and which incorporates the loan
                            contract. In this connection it may be observed that Article 69 of the
                            Haitian Constitution of 1889 which was in force in 1910 when the loan
                            contract was made and the law of ratification passed provides as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The legislative power enacts laws on all subjects of public
                                    interest.</p>
                                <p>“The initiative of legislation belongs to each Chamber and to the
                                    Executive power.</p>
                                <p>“Nevertheless, the appropriation laws and laws concerning the
                                    assessment, distribution, and manner of payment of taxes,
                                    creation <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0395"/>of revenue or
                                    increase of the expenses of the Government shall be first voted
                                    by the Chamber of Representatives.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In view of these Constitutional provisions, it seems to follow that the
                            loan contract is a part of the law of ratification and that otherwise
                            the contract would be invalid because it affects a subject of public
                            interest, increases the expenses of the Government and therefore its
                            provisions could only become binding upon the Haitian Government if
                            enacted into law by legislation originating in the House of
                            Representatives.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Article 70 of the Haitian Constitution of 1899 [<hi
                                rend="italic">1889</hi>] provides that “the authoritative
                            interpretation of the laws belongs to the Legislative power alone. That
                            interpretation shall be given in the shape of a law” and Article 35 of
                            the Constitution provides “that the three powers, the legislative, the
                            executive and the judicial are independent from each other in the
                            exercise of their own functions, which they perform separately. Neither
                            of them can delegate its faculties, nor go beyond the limits ascribed to
                            it.”</p>
                        <p>Reading together the provisions of Articles 35 and 70 of the
                            Constitution, it would appear that the provisions of such articles would
                            prohibit the delegation to arbitrators of the construction of the law of
                            ratification which incorporates the loan contract in question, and would
                            have constituted an insurmountable obstacle to any attempt of the
                            Haitian Government to bind itself in 1910 to submit to arbitration the
                            interpretation of any of its laws. In this view of the matter it would
                            seem that the arbitration clause of the loan contract so far as it
                            relates to the interpretation of the contract and not merely to matters
                            of detail in the execution thereof was void as beyond the powers of the
                            representatives of the Haitian Government who entered into the
                            contract.</p>
                        <p>Finally I beg to invite your attention to the fact that in a note of
                            November 4, 1918<note n="16" xml:id="d257fn16">Not printed.</note> your
                            Embassy forwarded to the Department a communication addressed to it by
                            the Bank of the Union Parisienne and requested that, the facts therein
                            set forth having been brought to the knowledge of the Government of the
                            United States, this Government would endeavor to bring about appropriate
                            measures leading to a solution acceptable to the French bondholders of
                            the loan of 1910. In the communication from the bank transmitted by the
                            Embassy occurs the following language: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“According to a note delivered by the National Bank of the
                                    Republic of Haiti a copy of which will be found herewith,

                                    the 5 percent gold loan of 1910 of the Republic of Haiti since
                                    September 1915 aggregates up to March 1918 $2,058,251., of which
                                    there was applied to the service <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314"
                                        facs="0396"/>of the loan in March 1916 not more than
                                    $164,000 so that there would remain a difference for settlement
                                    of $1,894,251.</p>
                                <p>“At the present rate of exchange this sum would represent in
                                    francs an amount sufficient to pay all of the outstanding
                                    coupons.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that in transmitting to the
                            Department the note last mentioned with the enclosed letter from the
                            bank, which was done as stated in the note by the direction of your
                            Government, the French Government and the bank must be considered as
                            having acknowledged thereby that the 1910 loan of the Republic of Haiti
                            was payable at the current rate of the franc and not in gold and I am
                            therefore constrained to point out that the present position of your
                            Government and of the bank in asking for arbitration on the point of the
                            currency in which the loan is payable is inconsistent with the position
                            as taken in the note of November 4, 1918. I may add that, relying upon
                            that position, which seemed to it, as it does to the Government of the
                            United States, to be entirely sound, the Haitian Government proceeded
                            with its refunding arrangements accordingly, and that any action which
                            would result in establishing that the Haitian Government was in error on
                            this point would have a disastrous effect upon the financial and
                            economic condition of the Republic of Haiti and would operate to
                            counteract in great measure, the advance it has made in material
                            prosperity in the past few years. To such a result, I am sure, your
                            Government is far from wishing to contribute.</p>
                        <p>I am sure that you will understand that entertaining the views which are
                            above expressed, I am unable to accede to your request for the exercise
                            of efforts to induce the Haitian Government to accept the proposition
                            for arbitration put forward by the Bank of the Union Parisienne.</p>

                        <p>6. Department’s telegram January 10, 4 p.m. I have made communication as
                            directed to the Provisional President. The President-elect is not
                            expected at Tegucigalpa before the 20th.</p>
                        <p>The Provisional President informed me today that the army contemplated
                            will not exceed 2,000; that 3,000 rifles are desired in order to provide
                            a reserve; that the plans for organization are ready and will be
                            furnished the Legation in the near future; that they comprise a military
                            school for the training of officers who will be assigned districts; that
                            the governing idea is maintenance of order in the interior and
                            protection of long frontiers from bandit raids of recent occurrence; the
                            Honduranean Government is disposed to follow article 2 in the matter and
                            that he hopes the treaties will soon be ratified by the Honduranean
                            Congress; the question of foreign instructors has not been given
                            consideration and that he could not express any opinion thereupon before
                            consulting with the Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] My opinion is that 10 machine guns and 2,000 rifles are
                            sufficient for the internal police and protection. However, the amounts
                            requested seem [inadequate] if organized revolutionary incursions by <hi
                                rend="italic">emigrados</hi> at present in Guatemala and Nicaragua
                            are to be considered as an imminent danger. But this Legation is not in
                            a position to discuss this possibility advisedly. My impression is that
                            the authorities of Honduras are not unduly anxious over an immediate
                            revolution but they believe in adequate preparedness against such an
                            event.</p>

                            to the Department. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                            economy he prefers to purchase the bulk of the arms from the Government
                            of the United States rather than from private companies. He intimated
                            that delivery can be obtained from the United States Government within a

                            the north coast. See especially Consul Waller’s confidential despatch

                            being purchased in this country will enable the Government to maintain
                            order effectively but it desires that you should impress upon the
                            Government the desirability of handling the shipment in such a way that
                            there will be no danger that the arms may fall into the hands of
                            disaffected elements or potential disturbers of the peace. Please report

                        <p>27. Several raids have occurred recently along both the Guatemalan and
                            Nicaraguan frontiers of Honduras. While the object of these raids may be
                            in part political the Department does not feel that any political intent
                            should excuse murders and robberies committed by the raiders. It
                            therefore sympathizes with the reported intention of the Government of
                            Honduras to ask for the extradition of perpetrators of common law crimes
                            in the course of raids having <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0406"

                            movements, and it hopes that the Governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua,
                            which are of course interested in the preservation of orderly conditions
                            along the frontiers, will cooperate energetically with the Government of
                            Honduras in arresting and extraditing offenders. Please convey the views
                            of this Government informally to the Government of Guatemala. A similar
                            telegram is being sent to the American Legation at Managua.</p>

                        <p>29. You will present the following note to the Guatemalan Government:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I am instructed to inform Your Excellency that the Government of
                                    the United States is gravely concerned at the events which have
                                    recently occurred along the frontier between Guatemala and
                                    Honduras. Although my Government had received repeated reports
                                    that the Honduran refugees living in Guatemala were plotting
                                    against the constituted authorities in their own country and
                                    were receiving aid and encouragement in their activities from
                                    persons in Guatemala, it had not considered it necessary to make
                                    formal representations to Your Excellency’s Government because
                                    it was confident that the Government of Guatemala would do
                                    everything within its power, not only to fulfill its obligations
                                    under the Central American treaties, but to prevent its
                                    territory from being used in any way as a base of operations
                                    against a neighboring country. The reports which have hitherto
                                    been received have been called informally to the attention of
                                    Your Excellency’s Government merely as an act of courtesy in
                                    order to facilitate such action as the Government of Guatemala
                                    might deem advisable.</p>
                                <p>The recent very serious events which have occurred in Honduras in
                                    places close to the Guatemalan frontier, however, and the
                                    circumstantial reports regarding the activities of Honduran
                                    refugees in such places as Los Quebradas and Los Playitas
                                    inevitably give rise to grave doubts whether the authorities of
                                    Guatemala in the frontier districts have taken energetic steps
                                    to prevent revolutionary activities against Honduras and to
                                    prevent the shipment over the frontier of arms and supplies. My
                                    Government feels confident that the full and wholehearted
                                    cooperation by the Guatemalan authorities with the
                                    constitutional government of Honduras would put an end to any
                                    serious revolutionary disturbances in the western part of the
                                    latter Republic and it feels confident that the President of
                                    Guatemala, in view of the recent events along the frontier, will
                                    take all necessary steps to bring about such cooperation. It is
                                    unnecessary to state that the Government of the United States
                                    attributes the greatest importance to the maintenance of peace
                                    in Honduras, now gravely jeopardized by the activities along the
                                    Guatemalan frontier. It cannot but regard with apprehension the
                                    complications which will inevitably arise between the various
                                    Central American Governments should, any movement against the
                                    peace of Honduras be encouraged or tolerated by the authorities
                                    of a neighboring country.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>You will state orally that this Government would be gratified to receive
                            a detailed statement of the measures which the Government of Guatemala
                            has taken and of the measures which it takes after the receipt of the
                            above note to control the situation along the frontier.</p>

                            refer to the fact that President of Honduras had already asked the

                                <p>“April 23, 1925. Mr. Minister: Referring to the courteous note of
                                    Your Excellency number 141 dated the 21st of the present month,
                                    I have the honor to say to you that the Government of Guatemala
                                    deplores the recent disturbances of order in Honduras and which
                                    according to reports received by this Government took place at
                                    localities far from the frontier of Guatemala with the sole
                                    exception of a revolt of small magnitude in Ocotopeque.</p>
                                <p>My Government, while indeed it is true that rumors have been
                                    communicated to it, has not received proofs, nor even concrete
                                    accusations of revolutionary activities in our frontier, nor of
                                    shipment of arms, supplies or provisions destined for
                                    Honduras.</p>
                                <p>This Government feels assured that the Guatemalan frontier
                                    authorities have complied with definite orders to prevent every
                                    activity which might disturb the peace in said Republic.</p>
                                <p>The authorities of Guatemala have endeavored from the beginning
                                    to comply with all indications received from the Government of

                                    contribute in any way to disorders in that Republic, and it is
                                    to be noted that the refugees who returned to Honduras did so
                                    availing themselves of the call made to them to that effect by
                                    the Honduranean Government.</p>
                                <p>The Guatemalan Government continues disposed to give attention to
                                    all information and to continue to take every measure necessary
                                    to prevent any aid in favor of those who undertake to disturb
                                    the peace in that neighboring Republic.</p>
                                <p>I do not believe it inappropriate to state to Your Excellency

                                    tranquility of his country.</p>
                                <p>The frontier zone of Guatemala is completely tranquil and the
                                    authorities maintain every vigilance.</p>
                                <p>Guatemala feels satisfied and sure that it has complied in the
                                    best manner with its obligations and that same attitude will be
                                    its policy in the future.</p>
                                <p>It is a pleasure to me to bring the foregoing to the knowledge of
                                    Your Excellency and I avail myself of the opportunity to
                                    reiterate to you assurances of my highest and most distinguished
                                    consideration, (signed) Rob Löwenthal.”</p>

                        <p>The President and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated to me
                            verbally that among the measures taken by the Government of Guatemala
                            during the past four months to prevent activities along the frontier by
                            Honduranean <hi rend="italic">emigrados</hi> are orders to the
                            authorities in frontier districts to prevent all such activities, to
                            prevent all shipment of arms and supplies, and to concentrate all <hi
                                rend="italic">emigrados</hi> whose concentration was requested by
                            the diplomatic representative of Honduras and that they will continue
                            that policy. Mr. Löwenthal has also told me that the day before
                            receiving this Legation’s note of April 21 the Government of Guatemala
                            appointed a new military commander at Esquipulas because the Minister of
                            Honduras indicated doubt that the former commander was sufficiently
                            energetic although the Government of Guatemala thought otherwise. Mr.
                            Löwenthal also stated that on April 22 the Minister of Honduras said
                            that certain revolutionists had hidden arms in Esquipulas and that the
                            Government of Guatemala immediately ordered a rigid investigation and if
                            the assertion be substantiated the seizure of the arms and concentration
                            of the parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>Secretary of Legation Ellis tells me that general agent of the United
                            Fruit Company informed him today that he has just been advised by the
                            company’s general manager for Guatemala who resides on plantation <pb

                            that there is no movement of any kind in prospect there and that there
                            has been none. Repeated to Tegucigalpa.</p>

                                Minister to Salvador.</note> reporting a conversation with the
                            President of Salvador in which Dr. Quiñonez stated that he was
                            considering cooperating with the authorities of Honduras in the
                            maintenance of peace in the Department of Ocotepeque.</p>
                        <p>If you find that the Government of Salvador is actually contemplating any
                            steps of the nature suggested by Dr. Quiñonez you may say informally
                            that this Government feels that the intervention of Salvador’s armed
                            forces to maintain peace in Honduranean territory would set an
                            undesirable precedent and very possibly cause international
                            complications in Central America, and that it would therefore regret any
                            intervention of this nature, however beneficial the immediate effect
                            might be in promoting tranquillity in Honduras.</p>

                            revolutionists in Honduras are trying to get arms and ammunition from
                            Belize, British Honduras.</p>

                            measures to prevent arms being exported from Belize to Honduras where
                            they might be used to foment disorders. This Government is now
                            endeavoring to assist the recently established constitutional
                            authorities in Honduras to establish order.</p>

                                printed.</note> The President’s secretary exhibited this morning to
                            me at the Legation a letter in the handwriting of Ferrera from Guatemala
                            City dated May 10th addressed to Ochoa and followers associating himself
                            with the insurrectionists, giving definite instructions for revolution
                            in Honduras, and indicating hiding place of arms and the readiness of
                            Reds at Livingston, Guatemala to launch expedition at a designated
                            moment. Ochoa was killed shortly after landing from a sailing vessel at
                            Salado in company with a small number of leaders including a Mexican
                            general, who was later captured with further instructions from Ferrera
                            of the same character which I expect to verify in a few days. After
                            comparison of the above-mentioned letter with numerous examples of
                            Ferrera’s handwriting on file in the Legation I am able to certify to
                            the genuineness of the letter.</p>
                        <p>The Honduran Government would appreciate an intimation from the Legation
                            as to the advisability of requesting the expulsion of Ferrera from
                            Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>The Honduran Government reports successes and good prospects-in the
                            operation against scattered insurrectionary bands along the-border of
                            Guatemala. Repeated to Salvador and Guatemala.</p>

                        <p>35. As you have been informed by the Legation at Tegucigalpa the-Honduran
                            authorities have obtained convincing evidence that Ferrera <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0412"/>has been involved in recent
                            disturbances in Honduras. The Department is informing the legation at
                            Tegucigalpa that it feels that Honduras would be justified in asking the
                            Government of Guatemala to take appropriate steps to put an end to
                            Ferrera’s activities. Upon being informed that the Government of
                            Honduras has made representations in the matter you may inform President
                            Orellana that the American Chargé d’Affaires at Tegucigalpa has seen the
                            captured letter from Ferrera to the Honduran revolutionists and is
                            convinced of its authenticity, and that the Government of the United
                            States therefore hopes that the Guatemalan Government will take prompt
                            and effective steps to terminate Ferrera’s activities, as well as to
                            place under restraint and bring to justice the Honduran revolutionists
                            at Livingston.</p>

                        <p>55. Your May 27, 2 p.m. The Department feels that the Government of
                            Honduras would be justified in requesting the Government of Guatemala to
                            take appropriate steps to put an end to Ferrera’s activities now that
                            convincing evidence of his plotting against the constitutional
                            authorities in Honduras has been obtained. It is instructing the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            No. 51 of April 22, 1925,<note n="23" xml:id="d287fn23">Not
                                printed.</note> explaining your actions during the crisis at La
                            Ceiba on April 19 and 20, 1925. On your statement the Department
                            approves and commends your action. The Department fully realizes that
                            you were compelled to act upon your own initiative in communicating with
                            the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Denver</hi> regarding the
                            expected attack upon La Ceiba and has no doubt that you acted in
                            accordance with your best judgment.</p>
                        <p>While the Department desires that the American consular officers on the
                            north coast of Honduras should not hesitate to act upon their <pb
                                n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0413"/>own initiative in taking
                            measures essential for the the protection of American lives when they
                            are convinced that the emergency is so grave and the danger so imminent
                            as to leave no time for consulting the Department, when an emergency
                            arises the Department desires that you should bear in mind its wish that
                            Marines should not be landed at any time without prior consultation with
                            the Department unless the necessity for such action is absolutely clear.
                            It feels that the presence of an American warship will usually of itself
                            be sufficient to procure respect for American life and property and that
                            further measures should not ordinarily be taken unless such measures are
                            clearly imperative. While the naval commander, in accordance with the
                            standing instructions of the Navy Department must act upon his own
                            responsibility in landing forces or taking other military measures, he
                            will act in consultation with the diplomatic representative or consul
                            and presumably will ordinarily act in accordance with the latter’s
                            advice. Accordingly, the Department desires that its representatives
                            should express definitely to the naval commanders and to the Department
                            their opinion regarding the action necessary in a given emergency, and
                            it does not desire that they should transmit requests for help from the
                            local authorities or from resident Americans without transmitting at the
                            same time their own recommendations.</p>
                        <p>You are instructed to bear the foregoing carefully in mind for your
                            guidance in future contingencies.</p>

                        <p>61. Your June 6, 1 p.m.,<note n="25" xml:id="d289fn25">Not
                                printed.</note> and other correspondence regarding revolutionary
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Before the Department could consider lending more active support to the
                            Government of Honduras in maintaining stable political conditions it
                            would have to be certain that the Government of Honduras itself was
                            taking active and energetic steps to establish more orderly conditions,
                            particularly in such districts as Ceiba, Tela and Trumillo, and it would
                            also desire a formal request in writing from the Government of Honduras
                            indicating in just what way the Government of the United States could be
                            of assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Department views with concern the situation existing in the north
                            coast districts mentioned, where the failure of the constituted
                            authorities to maintain order and repress crime is a menace to the
                            security of the very numerous Americans living there. It desires
                            therefore that you should discuss with the appropriate officials the
                            necessity for taking active steps to deal with that situation. If they
                            express a desire to have the assistance of the United States in doing so
                            you may say that the Department would doubtless require a definite
                            statement in writing indicating in what manner its assistance was
                            desired, if it were to give consideration to the matter. You may also
                            say that any steps taken would presumably be more likely to be
                            successful if taken with the full approval and support of Carias,<note
                                n="26" xml:id="d289fn26">Tiburcio Carias, Chief of the National

                            would presumably wish to know that these leaders had formally expressed
                            their approval of any request for assistance which the Honduran
                            Government might make.</p>

                        <p>62. Department’s telegram number 42, June 27, 2 p.m., arrived this
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>About June 18th the Minister of Honduras informed the Secretary of State
                            for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala that the Government of Honduras desired
                            Ferrera to remain in Guatemala for the time being—see telegram from
                            Tegucigalpa, June 16th, 5 p.m.<note n="27" xml:id="d292fn27">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Yesterday Minister Lainez gave me a copy of note dated June 27th, in
                            which he requests that Ferrera and five others “leave the territory of
                            Guatemala because of their carrying on in this capital their
                            revolutionary activities against Honduras;” that they leave by way of
                            San José de Guatemala for Panama and that the Government of Honduras
                            gives assurances that it will not exercise jurisdiction for the removal
                            of those persons from the ship in which they make that journey to Panama
                            by way of Amapala.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the note does not make privilege to pass through
                            Amapala contingent upon expulsion as did the note of June 8th (see
                            Legation’s telegram June 15, 3 pm),<note n="27" xml:id="d292fn29">Not
                                printed.</note> but it seems that Tegucigalpa still wants an order
                            of expulsion or deportation and preferably at the instance of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Department says<note n="28" xml:id="d292fn28">An error; should be
                                “The Guatemalan Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs says.”</note>
                            that under the Constitution of Guatemala Ferrera as a Central American
                            cannot be legally expelled (see page 5 of despatch number 912–G June
                                16th).<note n="27" xml:id="d292fn30">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It appears that some members of the Cabinet are strongly against
                            expulsion and the issuance of an order would I am told perhaps result in
                            court proceedings.</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0416"/>
                        <p>Any advantage which might accrue to Tegucigalpa through having an order
                            of expulsion procured under existing circumstances through the medium of
                            the United States even though it be done unofficially would in my
                            judgment be offset by adverse psychological effects and also harmful
                            here and elsewhere to the United States and also harmful to the
                            Government of Honduras.</p>
                        <p>It would seem to be more appropriate to continue the Department’s policy
                            outlined in its telegram of May 29th, 5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>I shall today make unofficial inquiry as to action which Guatemala
                            intends to take in view of the above-mentioned note.</p>
                        <p>If circumstances suggest it I shall subsequently unless otherwise
                            instructed inquire what steps the Government of Guatemala has taken to
                            effectively terminate Ferrera’s activities. Repeated to Tegucigalpa.</p>

                        <p>44. Legation’s telegram number 62, June 29, noon. According to article 14
                            of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity,<note n="29" xml:id="d293fn29"
                                    ><hi rend="italic">Conference of Central American Affairs</hi>,
                                p. 287.</note> Guatemala has assumed the obligation “not to permit
                            any person, whether a national, Central American or foreigner, to
                            organize or foment revolutionary activities within its territory against
                            a recognized government of any other Central American republic.”
                            Department is unable to understand why Guatemala has failed to take
                            effective steps to end the activities of Ferrera against the peace of
                            Honduras. According to convincing evidence Ferrera has been instigating
                            revolutionary activities by means of correspondence if not by other
                            means. As reported in your June 15, 3 p.m.,<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d293fn30">Not printed.</note> the Government of Guatemala
                            has admitted that the measures which it has taken thus far have been
                            insufficient to prevent those activities.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is convinced, without attempting for
                            the present to suggest the nature of the measures which should be taken,
                            that present evidence not only justifies but demands that Guatemala take
                            some effective action. It has no doubt that such action is within the
                            power of the Government of Guatemala, and hopes that that action be
                            taken immediately.</p>
                        <p>The above may be read to the proper officials. The Department will make a
                            similar oral communication to the Guatemalan Minister. The Department
                            does not wish to urge any particular measure officially. It feels,
                            nevertheless, that only the departure of Ferrera, <pb n="335"
                                xml:id="pg_335" facs="0417"/>preferably to Panama, or his
                            confinement under conditions which will prevent him effectively from
                            communicating with his supporters will be satisfactory. We cannot
                            perceive why a suggestion to Guatemala that she comply with her solemn
                            treaty obligations after being given convincing proof of the violation
                            of her neutrality by Ferrera should have the “adverse psychological
                            effects” which you mention. The Department relies on you to put forth
                            your best efforts to convince the Government of Guatemala of the
                            necessity of taking the proper measures to prevent Guatemala from being
                            employed as a base for plots against the Honduran Government.</p>

                            and that President Orellana expressed interest and said that in order to

                            and informally advise President Orellana that the Department feels the
                            present administration in Honduras is doing all that it can to establish
                            and maintain peace, and that if it receives the friendly support and
                            cooperation which it has a right to expect from neighboring governments,
                            no other joint action on their part would appear necessary or advisable,
                            and the Government of Honduras will probably be able to dominate the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that the need today is not for further
                            international conferences, but for a strict compliance by all the
                            Central American republics with their existing treaty obligations, so
                            that attempts to launch revolutions in Honduras from adjacent territory
                            may be unavailing.</p>

                            despatch (No. 902) of November 20, 1925,<note n="32" xml:id="d299fn32"
                                >Not printed.</note> regarding political conditions in Honduras and
                            more especially the efforts of the President to obtain American Marines
                            to preserve order should certain political officers be removed.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires to express its high approval of Mr. Dennis’ reply
                            that the problems of the Honduran Government should be solved by native
                            statesmanship and not by American arms. The Department feels that no
                            lasting improvement can be attained in Central America as long as all
                            parties look to Washington for the last word. Unless there is
                            responsibility among the people themselves for the conduct of their
                            Government and a desire among the people themselves for improved
                            conditions any efforts on the part of this Government would appear to be
                            illusory. The Department desires, therefore, that you should make use of
                            every opportunity to impress upon the members of the Government and
                            others in Honduras that the responsibility for the Government rests upon
                            them; that the center of Honduran political activities is in Honduras
                            and not in Washington and that regeneration must come from within. You
                            should give your encouragement to any individuals or groups of
                            individuals who are seriously endeavoring to bring about better
                            conditions in Honduras on the basis of the assumption of responsibility
                            therefor by the Hondurans.</p>

                            Honduranean Government has been summarily rejected as unacceptable by
                            the British representative. The President wishes to defer action until
                            the question of the British debts can be considered at Washington in
                            conjunction with the raising of a large loan. In response to urgent
                            verbal solicitations of advice I have informed the President that in the
                            absence of instructions I was unauthorized to recommend any course of
                            action; however, that it was my personal and confidential opinion that
                            were the Honduranean Government to decide to defer action upon the
                            agreement pending the arrival at Washington of the representative of
                            Honduras, Señor Lopez, who was being sent in a few days to negotiate a
                            loan, this decision would not be ignored or displeasing to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>The President would like to have an expression of opinion from the
                            Department as he is somewhat impressed by the insistence of the British
                            representative. I explained to the President that the Department might
                            not feel disposed to make a statement which might be taken as a
                            direction to the Honduranean Government in respect of an issue between
                            the latter and the British bondholders but that I would undertake to
                            obtain an intimation from the Department for the guidance of the
                            President and of the Legation.</p>
                        <p>I have received today a note from the British representative asking me to
                            inquire of the Department whether it would be prepared to convey to the
                            Honduranean Government an intimation with regard <pb n="339"

                            contained in earlier instructions to the Legation.<note n="35"
                                xml:id="d300fn35">On Apr. 30, 1923, Secretary Hughes instructed the
                                American Minister in Honduras as follows: “The Department believes a
                                suitable settlement of the British debt would be to the advantage of
                                Honduras and you may inform the Government of Honduras very

                        <p>I made it clear to the British consul as well as to the President that my
                            Government would view with satisfaction the settlement of the British
                            debt and that I believed settlement of the question would be a condition
                            of the Department’s approval of any large American loan of [<hi

                            the acceptance of the agreement without further instructions from my
                            Government which I felt possibly might not care to influence the
                            Honduranean Government to any action with regard to the British debt,
                            that in view of the projected loan negotiations might be against the
                            best judgment of [my?] Government.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me last night that Señor

                        <p>29. Your No. 36, March 7, 6 p.m. You may inform the Government of
                            Honduras that this Government cannot undertake to give advice regarding
                            the acceptance or rejection of any specific agreement with the British
                            bondholders. You may say, however, that you are authorized
                            confidentially to call the attention of the Government of Honduras to
                            the fact that the conclusion of a suitable arrangement with the British
                            bondholders might strengthen the credit of Honduras and thus facilitate
                            the flotation of any subsequent loan. You may also suggest that in order
                            not to tie up permanently revenues or assets which might be used as
                            security for a future loan, the Government might wish to include in any
                            agreement reached with the British bondholders provision giving it the
                            option to discharge its obligations to them at any time by the payment
                            of the capitalized value of the installments remaining unpaid at that
                            date. A provision could readily be inserted giving this option and
                            specifying the rate of discount and the manner in which the unpaid
                            installments would be capitalized.</p>

                            with him or sent to him, which are not reasonably and clearly

                            of adaptation for purposes of advertisement, and intended for gratuitous
                            distribution, shall, when introduced in reasonable quantities, also be

                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) If the original license was issued for a

                            for the samples will be correspondingly extended. It is understood,
                            however, that this prescription shall be subject to the customs laws of

                            the signature at Washington on June 24, 1925, of the Treaty of
                            Friendship, Commerce and Consular Rights between the United States of
                            America and the Kingdom of Hungary, an exchange of notes was made
                            between the Secretary of State of the United States and the Envoy
                            Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Hungary at Washington, in
                            which the understanding was stated and accepted that the ratification of
                            the said Treaty would be subject to reservations and understandings to
                            be set forth in an exchange of notes between the contracting parties in
                            connection with the exchange of ratifications of the said Treaty so as
                            to make it plain that this condition is understood and accepted by each
                            of them, and that these reservations and understandings shall be in
                            substance to the effect that there be added to Article I of the Treaty a
                            statement that nothing contained therein shall be construed to affect
                            existing statutes of either country in relation to the immigration of
                            aliens or the right of either country to enact such statutes, and also
                            that the sixth paragraph of Article VII of the said Treaty shall remain
                            in force for twelve months from the day on which the Treaty becomes
                            effective, and, if not then terminated, on ninety days previous notice
                            shall remain in force until either of the High Contracting Parties shall
                            enact legislation inconsistent therewith, when the same shall <pb
                                n="357" xml:id="pg_357" facs="0439"/>automatically lapse at the end
                            of sixty days from such enactment, and on such lapse each High
                            Contracting Party shall enjoy all the rights which it would have
                            possessed had such paragraph not been embraced in the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Since that date the Senate in fact, when giving its advice and consent to
                            the ratification of this Treaty, did so with the reservations above set
                            forth.</p>
                        <p>I am, therefore, instructed by my Government in proceeding to the

                            accepted by each of the High Contracting Parties, that its ratification
                            of the said Treaty is subject to the reservations and understandings
                            above recited and set forth in an exchange of notes of June 24, 1925, by
                            the Secretary of State of the United States and the Envoy Extraordinary
                            and Minister Plenipotentiary of Hungary at Washington.</p>
                        <p>You may regard this note as sufficient acceptance by the Government of
                            the United States of these reservations and understandings, and an
                            acknowledgment of this note on the occasion of the exchange of
                            ratifications, accepting, by direction and on behalf of the Government
                            of Hungary, the said reservations and understandings will be considered
                            by the Government of the United States as completing the required
                            exchange of notes and the acceptance by both Governments of the
                            reservations and understandings.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: As I explained to you over
                            the telephone this noon I found when I returned to my desk this morning
                            that a cable had just arrived from Rome transmitting a request from our
                            correspondents there, the Bank of Italy, that we should kindly arrange
                            for them the banking credit of $50,000,000 which I discussed tentatively
                            when I was in Rome early last month.</p>
                        <p>For your exceedingly confidential information, the Bank of Italy,
                            together with the Bank of Naples and the Bank of Sicily, (being the
                            other two leading banks in Italy) are joining in arranging this credit
                            with their friendly banking correspondents in America. The term of the
                            credit will be for six months, with an option of renewal for a further
                            period of six months. These banks together will engage in case the
                            credit is not otherwise discharged at maturity, to ship gold to
                            discharge the credit. The Government undertakes to grant authorization
                            for such shipment of gold, if it should prove necessary, and, as a
                            matter of good faith, will undertake to guarantee the credit.</p>
                        <p>The Bank of Italy explains that with the tendency of Italian exchange
                            rather weak it deems it prudent to arrange this banking reserve looking
                            forward to legitimate stabilization of the lira, although it is opposed
                            to the policy of the Bank to attempt any appreciation of the lira
                            through artificial means.</p>
                        <p>While, as explained to you, Mr. Mellon and Mr. Hoover, we regard this as
                            a banking matter and so very different from any foreign government loan
                            issued in this market; nevertheless, we are happy as we wrote you some
                            time ago to keep you informed as to any considerable banking transaction
                            of this kind. We plan to proceed with our arrangements <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0441"/>in the matter promptly, and I shall
                            take the liberty of telephoning you some time tomorrow to ascertain
                            whether the information above recited is sufficient for your
                            purposes.</p>

                            receipt of your letter of May 26, 1925, in which you were good enough to
                            inform me, in confirmation of telephone advices, in regard to the
                            proposed banking credit of $50,000,000 to Italian banks for a term of
                            six months, with an option of renewal for a further like period. I note
                            that it is expected that the Italian Government would undertake to
                            guarantee the credit, and I note further your observations to the effect
                            that this is a banking credit rather than a public flotation of a
                            Government loan.</p>
                        <p>In the circumstances I desire to say that while this Department expresses
                            no opinion concerning the transaction in question, it could not withhold
                            objection to a public flotation of Italian bonds or an extension of
                            credit to the Italian Government to take up the credit in question or
                            for other purposes, unless, in the meantime, the Italian Government had
                            taken suitable steps looking toward the settlement or refunding of its
                            indebtedness to the Government of the United States.</p>

                        <p>101. (1) On August 4 the Italian Ambassador spoke with me regarding a <hi
                                rend="italic">note verbale</hi> which he had handed to me a short
                            time ago<note n="1b" xml:id="d312fn1b"><hi rend="italic">Note
                                    verbale</hi> dated July 27; not printed.</note> and which
                            detailed at considerable length Italian financial difficulties. He gave
                            me at the same time the substance of messages received from Mussolini
                            expressing a desire to borrow money in this country for industrial
                            development and stabilization of the Italian exchange. Answering his
                            inquiry about the attitude of the United States Government toward such
                            loans, I stated that the position of this Government had not changed;
                            that the informal Italian proposal of which an outline was supplied in
                            the Department’s telegram No. 81, July l,<note n="2" xml:id="d312fn2"
                                >Not printed.</note> did not contain a basis for negotiations, as I
                            had already told him; and that we could not view financing of this sort
                            with favor until the Italian Government made a suitable debt-funding
                            proposal. The Ambassador intimated also that when he returned from
                            Italy, possibly in September, an Italian commission would be able to
                            undertake negotiations.</p>
                        <p>(2) The Department of State has been consulted about projected loans to
                            the Italian State Railways and to the cities of Naples and Rome, and the
                            reply has been that this financing could not be regarded favorably while
                            the Government of Italy had not taken suitable steps toward a debt
                            settlement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On July 31 Mr. Thomas W. Lamont, of J. P.
                            Morgan and Company, telephoned to me saying that he understood that
                            Blair and Company were negotiating to loan twenty-five million dollars
                            to the Italian State Railways and that he would like to know, for his
                            own information, what would be the attitude of this Government. I told
                                <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0443"/>him confidentially that the
                            Italian Ambassador had called on me and left a Memorandum<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d313fn3">Probably refers to <hi rend="italic">note
                                    verbale</hi> of July 27; not printed.</note> which stated in
                            substance that his government would like to know what would be the
                            attitude of the State Department if the Italian Government should seek
                            to make further loans in New York. He stated that they contemplated
                            making a loan with Morgan and Company and the Chase National Bank. I
                            informed Mr. Lamont that I had told the Italian Ambassador that I did
                            not think the Government could look with favor on such loans so long as
                            the Italian Government had only made an offer which, as it was perfectly
                            aware, we could not even consider as a basis of discussion for a
                            settlement. Mr. Lamont stated that his firm was not negotiating a loan
                            with the government and that their attitude was that until Italy had
                            done more than she had at present, they would not consider the subject
                            of a loan and that he had so informed the Italian Ambassador. He said
                            the Italian Ambassador replied he was aware that the offer they made
                            would not be acceptable to the United States. I told Mr. Lamont that
                            they should not then have made such an offer. Furthermore, I said that
                            so far as Blair and Company negotiations were concerned, we would
                            consider the loan to the Italian State Railways in exactly the same
                            position as a loan to the government and that I had told the Italian
                            Ambassador I would see Mr. Mellon on Monday and answer his note, but
                            that my attitude was as I have expressed it.</p>

                        <p>132. Referring to Department’s telegram 101, August 19, 2 p.m.
                            Representative of banking firm of Blair &amp; Co. is here carrying on
                            negotiations for the floating in New York of at least 10 million dollar
                            bond issue to finance hydroelectric and industrial enterprises in Italy.
                            He seems to have the impression that the State Department will not
                            object to floating the loan at this time, and I have therefore suggested
                            that the firm consult the Department before proceeding further. It is
                            probable that they will do so in the next few days.</p>

                        <p>121. Embassy’s telegram No. 119 of July 22, 5 p.m. I have taken up Seldes
                            case with the Foreign Office and as Italian Government has decided
                            definitely that he must leave, I have arranged that 10 days from July 25
                            be given him to prepare for his departure. Should he fail to leave
                            within specified time, he will be expelled. I have communicated this to
                            Seldes, who states that he wishes to have from the police or some
                            governmental agency a written notice to depart, upon receipt of which he
                            will go. The chief of the press section of the Foreign Office stated
                            today that he would be given this notice.</p>
                        <p>Seldes wishes a document in writing which he may be able to use in
                            writing up his expulsion from Italy. I anticipate no violent measures as

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my telegram No. 119 of
                            July 22, 5 p.m. and No. 121 of July 27, 4 p.m., and to the Department’s
                            No. 91 of July 25, 1 p.m., concerning the expulsion by the Italian
                            Government of Mr. George Seldes, correspondent of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Chicago Tribune</hi>, I have the honor to report as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0447"/>
                        <p>On June 4th last the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr.
                            Grandi, addressed a personal letter to me, the translation of which is
                            herewith enclosed,<note n="8" xml:id="d322fn8">Not printed.</note>
                            stating that Mr. Seldes had sent to his paper on the previous evening a
                            telegram, a copy of which was enclosed<note n="9" xml:id="d322fn9">Not
                                enclosed with the despatch.</note> which the Italian Government
                            considered as being of an alarmist nature. The letter added that while
                            the Italian Government wished the foreign correspondents to enjoy all
                            freedom of action, it considered it a duty to urge against sending
                            unnecessarily alarmist reports. The report of Mr. Seldes above referred
                            to was a summing up of events attendant upon the killing of
                                Matteotti<note n="10" xml:id="d322fn10">Opposition deputy alleged to
                                have been murdered by Fascists in June 1924.</note> and stating that
                            matters would reach a crisis on June 10th, the first anniversary of the
                            assassination. His report further stated that all Italy was excited,
                            that a clash was expected and that many wondered whether Parliament
                            would be a scene of bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>The substance of this letter was made known to Mr. Seldes who promptly
                            addressed a letter of explanation to Mr. Grandi, thereby temporarily
                            relieving the Embassy of further action in the matter.</p>
                        <p>On July 18th, however, I received a second and far more drastic
                            communication from the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, stating that
                            in view of certain recent telegrams sent by Mr. Seldes to his paper he
                            could no longer be considered as <hi rend="italic">persona grata</hi> in
                            Italy. He therefore requested that I so inform Mr. Seldes, in order that
                            he might understand the situation and leave without a definite writ of
                            expulsion being served on him by the police. A translation of Mr.
                            Grandi’s letter together with Mr. Seldes reports which were objected to
                            are herewith enclosed.<note n="11" xml:id="d322fn11">Not
                            printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Acting upon this letter from Mr. Grandi, I immediately sent for Mr.
                            Seldes and communicated the contents of the letter, furnishing him with
                            a copy of it. Mr. Seldes accepted the decision with little comment but
                            on leaving my office he conferred with his colleagues of the American
                            Press who, shortly after in a jointly signed note to me, requested that
                            I make an appointment for them to meet Mr. Grandi.</p>
                        <p>At my next visit to the Foreign Office I made this request of Mr. Grandi,
                            and was informed by him that he was willing to receive the American
                            correspondents provided they made no protest concerning the expulsion of
                            Mr. Seldes. He explained further that his purpose in writing to me
                            concerning Mr. Seldes was to have me convey to him a hint that he was no
                            longer <hi rend="italic">persona grata</hi> and that he should leave
                            Italy, thus relieving the Italian Government of the necessity of taking
                            more drastic measures. I replied that if the Italian Government <pb
                                n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0448"/>had definitely decided upon the
                            expulsion of Mr. Seldes, I would again inform him. I urged, however,
                            that he should be given time to make proper arrangements for his
                            departure, to which Mr, Grandi agreed, stipulating that he would be
                            given ten days from the 25th of July, but that if he had not left Italy
                            by that time the Italian Government would be compelled to adopt other
                            measures.</p>
                        <p>On the day following my interview with Mr. Grandi, he received the
                            American Press correspondents. I have been given no report of this
                            meeting but no change of purpose as regards Mr. Seldes’ expulsion was
                            made known. I therefore again informed Mr. Seldes that he must prepare
                            to go, which he agreed to do. He said, however, that he would like to
                            have a definite order or request to leave which he could show to his
                            Chief. Accordingly, this request was made today by a member of the
                            Embassy staff to the Chief of the Press Section of the Foreign Office,
                            who stated that a written document would be given to Mr. Seldes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Seldes has today informed me that he proposes to leave Italy on July
                            29th for Paris, en route to Vienna where he has been transferred by his
                            paper.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honour to address you
                            and acknowledge receipt of your communication of June 18th. I desire to
                            express our appreciation of your courtesy in this matter and in
                            compliance therewith I respectfully submit some minor changes which I
                            feel would make the Agreements more acceptable to my Principals in
                            accordance with my general instructions.</p>
                        <p>Realising the time conditions under which the final document was
                            prepared, I desire to call attention to one subject which I understood
                            was agreed upon in our conference of June 16th but to which no reference
                            is made in the document at hand namely:</p>
                        <p>Provision for the Lessee to engage in such other agricultural pursuits,
                            i. e., foodstuffs and the like which will enable him to effectively and
                            efficiently operate his property.</p>
                        <p>Also the provision that the Lessee will be entitled to the opportunity to
                            engage in any other operations upon his holdings under the same terms
                            and conditions granted any other individual or corporation and under the
                            laws and statutes of the Republic of Liberia. As we pointed out we
                            desired this as protection from any possible future outside
                            interference.</p>
                        <p>It would also be much appreciated if you would consider the matter of
                            qualifying the road building clauses as regards routes and
                            specifications so that they would not be taken to provide for any routes
                                <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0451"/>that would be ineffective
                            for our use and place a limit upon the amount necessary to expend per
                            mile.</p>
                        <p>We also request consideration of the insertion of clauses exempting our
                            properties from any taxes other than those specified and for exemption
                            of our lines of communications from taxation while they are being used
                            by us and in view of the fact we have made provision for their public
                            use at all times.</p>
                        <p>I also beg leave to submit for your consideration a provision in the
                            Harbour Agreement to the effect that the cost of maintenance and repairs
                            shall not be deducted from the Port and Harbour dues thus assigned when
                            such dues fall below a certain minimum figure. This figure could be
                            determined later. We respectfully submit that such a provision would be
                            required by our Principals in order to determine the amortization of
                            their investment.</p>
                        <p>In view of the shortness of time, I beg leave to inform you that if such
                            additional provisions as I have suggested are agreeable to the
                            Government they might be placed in the form of an addenda [<hi
                                rend="italic">sic</hi>] to the document already submitted and could
                            be incorporated later in the final Agreement. If satisfactory to the
                            Government and Your Excellency this would be satisfactory to us.</p>
                        <p>With expressions of esteem and appreciation, I would appreciate the
                            privilege of discussing these suggestions in case you desire further
                            explanation of them.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Amos C. Miller, (address, 39 South LaSalle Street, Chicago,
                            Illinois), Vice President and General Counsel of the Firestone Tire
                            Company, accompanied by Mr. Robinson and Mr. Wierman, called by <pb
                                n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0462"/>appointment to discuss the
                            possibilities of securing a rubber concession in Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Miller stated that the Company had had the benefit of several
                            interviews with Dr. De la Rue, Collector of Customs of Liberia, and had
                            given careful consideration to the question of guaranties which would be
                            necessary to protect them in making any large investment in Liberia. It
                            was their desire to secure from Liberia a rubber concession to run for
                            fifty years, with the right of renewal for an additional fifty years, on
                            the basis of a rental of five to ten cents per acre, the Company being
                            given an option for a million acres. The Company would also agree to pay
                            two and a half cents per pound of rubber exported, the revenues from
                            this export tax to be expended for public improvements and betterments
                            in the Republic. The Company would also be prepared to make a loan to
                            the Republic of Liberia through its fiscal agents, say the National City
                            Bank of New York, for 5 million dollars, provided that all the revenues
                            of Liberia were assigned to the service of the loan, and provided
                            further that the Liberian Government should agree to the appointment by
                            the President of the United States of Americans to collect and disburse
                            all these revenues.</p>
                        <p>The Company had obtained a copy of the loan arrangement signed by
                            representatives of the United States and of Liberia in October,
                                1921,<note n="6" xml:id="d329fn6"><ref target="frus1921v02#pg_370"

                            Company felt that in order properly to protect its proposed
                            concessionary interests and the service of the loan, provisions similar
                            to those set forth in the American-Liberian loan agreement of 1921
                            should be incorporated in their proposed loan agreement and accepted by
                            the Government of Liberia. The Company now wished to inquire whether the
                            Department would be prepared, if a loan agreement were made on that
                            basis, to appoint the officials in question, and, in a word, to assume
                            the obligations and the duties set forth in the 1921 loan agreement.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the Department would take the matter under consideration
                            and advise them in due course. Mr. Miller also stated that if it were so
                            desired he would be glad to put their inquiry in writing.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a number of questions, the Company’s representatives
                            furnished the following information: That the site of the proposed
                            rubber plantation would be at least fifteen miles from the coast; that
                            it would be necessary to construct roads and make other public
                            improvements, including a harbor; that possibly thirty thousand laborers
                            would be employed, including a large number of American engineers, and
                            so forth, to handle the proposed developments; that careful sanitation
                            would be necessary, as all forms of tropical diseases were rampant, <pb
                                n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0463"/>and the average life of the
                            white man in that territory was very short; that the purpose of the
                            Company was to assure themselves an adequate supply of rubber which
                            would be entirely within their own control, and as they would thereby be
                            free from British control of markets they expected strong opposition
                            from foreign quarters; that it was largely for this reason and in order
                            to protect their investment … that they considered it necessary to
                            obtain the extensive control contemplated, which would also be a
                            safeguard against the possible failure to obtain adequate protection
                            from this Government. To an inquiry why they did not consider it
                            possible to secure the necessary safeguards through appropriate
                            provisions in their proposed rubber concession, the reply was made that
                            they had in mind the failure of this Government to accord what they
                            considered adequate protection to American investments in Mexico. It was
                            also observed that there was not even the protection of the Monroe
                            Doctrine in Liberia. Reference was made to similar large enterprises,
                            such as the United Fruit Company. While Mr. Miller did not appear to be
                            acquainted with the United Fruit Company’s enterprises in the Caribbean,
                            Mr. Robinson evidently had some conception of their extent, but he
                            confirmed Mr. Miller’s views respecting the necessity of obtaining some
                            definite control over the administrations of the Republic of
                            Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wierman spoke from personal knowledge of conditions in Liberia, and
                            made it clear that he did not feel that an enterprise of the magnitude
                            and importance of that contemplated could be successfully carried out
                            without guaranties substantially along the lines of those set forth in
                            the agreement of October, 1921. He also stated that the Company had
                            rubber men in Liberia; that their reports were favorable, and that the
                            Company had no doubt that if they were not interfered with they would
                            find it possible to make a success of the production of rubber in
                            Liberia.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hines, who called as a result of a personal note to Mr. Firestone,
                            stated that it was the intention of Mr. Firestone to proceed immediately
                            with the concession for a million acres of land for a rubber plantation
                            in Liberia. For the past several months the Firestone attorneys have
                            been working over the concession and expect to have it in final form in
                            a few days. They intend to submit it to the Department for any comment
                            or advice that the Department may care to give in regard to its terms.
                            Mr. Hines then intends to take the document to Liberia, conclude a final
                            agreement with the Liberian Government and attempt to procure
                            ratification from the Liberian Congress immediately. I asked Mr. Hines
                            whether the Firestone concession was contingent upon an American loan to
                            the Government of Liberia. Mr. Hines replied that, while it had been the
                            original hope of Mr. Firestone to make sure of American financial
                            support for the semi-bankrupt Liberian Government prior to investing
                            heavily in Liberia, he had now decided to go ahead with his concession
                            and take up the loan question subsequently.</p>
                        <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0465"/>
                        <p>Mr. Hines, who is the representative who carried on the original
                            negotiations with the President and Secretary of State of Liberia,<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d331fn8">The reference is to negotiations carried on
                                by Mr. Hines with the Liberian Government at Monrovia in June 1924.

                                    <ref target="#pg_389">pp. 389</ref> ff.</note> was quite frank
                            in saying that the political fate of Liberia was of the very greatest
                            concern to Mr. Firestone. He pointed out that the establishment of a
                            rubber plantation was a risk of an entirely different sort from an oil
                            or mineral concession. Out of the latter it might be possible to get the
                            capital invested within a few years and then divide the profits with the
                            local government or, if the local government went to pieces and chaotic
                            conditions ensued, no serious net loss of capital might be incurred. In
                            the former, however, everything for the first five years was investment
                            and the proceeds will not begin to appear until after that period of
                            time. Consequently, Mr. Firestone would be gambling with a heavy capital
                            investment in case he had no assurance that the Liberian Government
                            might not go to pieces within the next few years.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hines volunteered the information, which has been given the
                            Department before, that Mr. Firestone would be most anxious to have
                            American advisors and administrators appointed for carrying out the
                            provisions of any loan that might be made to Liberia even though the
                            loan were a private one from American bankers.</p>
                        <p>I suggested to Mr. Hines that the Department was not in a position to
                            discuss the loan phase of the question until some plan for such a loan
                            was put before it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hines stated that the concession plan which Mr. Firestone’s attorneys
                            had drawn up has no monopolistic features of any kind and does not
                            provide for the surrender by the Liberian Government of any sovereign
                            rights.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the interview, Mr. Hines stated that neither Mr.
                            Firestone nor Mr. Ford had yet taken any steps to interest members of
                            Congress or of the Senate in reviving the original loan plan, since they
                            felt that it was better to wait until after the election to discuss this
                            and also in view of the fact that they intend to put the concession
                            through before going after the loan.</p>
                        <p>My general impression of the Firestone plan of procedure is that he will
                            request the Department to say whether the proposal, as submitted, would
                            entitle the concession to protection as a legitimate American enterprise
                            abroad. If the Department is benevolent on this score, the concession
                            will be put through, but no considerable investment will be made by Mr.
                            Firestone until he is reasonably certain that adequate financial and
                            political safeguards will be provided <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384"
                                facs="0466"/>to assure the continuation of Liberia as a political
                            entity. Mr. Hines stated that he hoped to submit the concession to us
                            within the next few days.</p>

                            serious matter to our commerce, especially highway transportation which
                            is growing so rapidly and is so important to our welfare and
                            prosperity.</p>
                        <p>I took it upon myself to interest our Government and an appropriation was
                            made in March, 1923 for $500,000 to investigate new sources of supply in
                            the Philippine Islands and Latin America. Being deeply interested, I
                            employed a staff of expert rubber growers and started a private
                            investigation.</p>
                        <p>I found that Liberia, located on the West Coast of Africa, offered
                            splendid opportunities equal to or better than any in the British
                            possessions in the Far East in the way of land, climate and labor
                            conditions. If the rubber industry could be developed in Liberia on a
                            large scale it would not only bring relief to the United States for
                            commercial purposes, but it would be a great safeguard to us in time of
                            national emergency.</p>
                        <p>As a result of this investigation, my representatives negotiated
                            agreements with Government officials in Liberia relative to the leasing
                            of land and other concessions, and with the exception of a few minor
                            changes, I am submitting these agreements to you<note n="10"

                        <p>The Secretary referred to the proposed agreements submitted by the
                            Company informally to the Department, the first relating to the lease
                            “of the Mount Barclay Rubber Plantation for experimental purposes”, the
                            second relating to the lease of one million acres of land in Liberia,
                            and the third relating to the improvement of the port of Monrovia.</p>

                            <item>The Secretary desired at the outset to express his full
                                appreciation of the importance of obtaining an independent source of
                                supply of rubber for American interests. On the other hand, the
                                Company should not be under any misapprehension as to the
                                relationship of the United States to the Republic of Liberia. He,
                                himself, in supporting the proposed loan agreement of 1921 before
                                the Congress, had stressed the peculiar historical relationship
                                between the United States and Liberia, and had emphasized the
                                special considerations involved, aside from any question of moral
                                commitment that may have existed with respect to the loan. He would
                                point out that no matter what his personal feelings had been
                                respecting our obligations in the matter, Congress had not supported
                                these views or given its concurrence to the agreement in
                                question.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The Company had asked the Department to indicate whether it had
                                objection to the proposed arrangements. He had noticed a proposed
                                provision whereby the Company undertook to obtain either from the
                                Government of the United States or from private persons a loan to
                                the Government of Liberia upon the terms and conditions proposed in
                                1921, which, for its part, the Government of Liberia was to agree to
                                accept. This provision might be misunderstood and afford in Liberia
                                grounds for belief that there was a possibility of <pb n="386"
                                    xml:id="pg_386" facs="0468"/>reopening the question of a
                                Government loan. It should be made quite clear that the proposed
                                provision involved no committal on the part of this
                                Government.</item>

                            <item>With respect to the relationship of this Government to private
                                loans of an analogous character, in certain instances, particularly
                                in Central America, the Department had done what it properly could
                                to be helpful, and in certain instances had, upon the request of
                                both parties, undertaken to assist, so far as it properly could, in
                                the settlement of difficulties that might arise, for example,
                                through recourse to arbitration. Having no special relationship or
                                obligation to Liberia, this Government could not assume more
                                extensive responsibilities in connection with a loan by private
                                parties to Liberia.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>With respect to the term of the lease, now set at ninety-nine
                                years, renewable for fifty, the Secretary felt that some provision
                                should be made for a revision of the taxation features of the
                                agreement. As now drawn, the proposal was too inelastic. It was
                                desirable that the contract should be fair <hi rend="italic">per
                                    se</hi>. The Company itself might well desire not to be bound
                                too rigidly to the terms fixed at this time. It might be even a
                                distinct advantage to the Company to insert a provision which would
                                make it possible, say after fifty years to revise these taxation
                                features of the proposal.</item>
                            <label>(5)</label>
                            <item>In examining the papers before him, the Secretary had found
                                certain allusions to protection and support in the future. The
                                Secretary would not and could not commit his successors in office in
                                such a matter. He could, however, state that it was the historic
                                policy of the Department to lend proper support of a diplomatic
                                character to the just claims of its citizens. Each claim as
                                presented was considered on its merits, and if found to be well
                                founded in justice the Department took such action as was
                                appropriate to the occasion. It should be clearly understood that
                                there was no question of resort to force. It was a matter of
                                appropriate diplomatic support. In this connection, the Secretary
                                wished to emphasize the fact, which he hoped Mr. Firestone would
                                appreciate, that the Secretary could give no different assurance in
                                the case of Liberia than he could give in a similar case with
                                respect to any other country.</item>

                            <item>Mr. Firestone thanked the Secretary for his statement of the
                                Department’s position in the matter, and expressed the hope that his
                                enterprise in Liberia might have the moral support of the
                                Department. He emphasized the importance of a free source of supply
                                of rubber to American interests, and pointed out the great
                                advantages which would undoubtedly accrue to Liberia if his
                                proposition went through. It was far from his thought to pirate or
                                promote that country for purely selfish ends.</item>

                            <item>At this point the Secretary took occasion to refer to certain
                                information which had reached him and which Mr. Castle, the Chief of
                                the Western European Division, would explain to Mr. Firestone,
                                respecting the attitude of certain of the Company’s representatives
                                in Liberia towards the Government and people of Liberia. In a
                                personal way the Secretary alluded to the importance of the use of
                                great tact and judgment in dealing with the Liberian Government,
                                where a kindly and understanding attitude would have an important
                                responsive effect and would also avoid the possibility of
                                unfortunate backfires in this country.</item>

                            <item>In returning to the question of the loan, Mr. Firestone’s remarks
                                indicated that he had not lost hope of obtaining eventually a loan
                                from the Government of the United States to Liberia. He touched upon
                                the importance of the protection to his interests which would be
                                afforded by the provisions of the 1921 agreement, and he expressed
                                his understanding that in the event that it were found desirable to
                                arrange a private loan, which would include a refunding of the 1912
                                loan, this Government would not object to assuming a similar
                                relationship to that now existing to the 1912 loan. In reply the
                                Secretary referred to his previous remarks in that connection, and
                                again emphasized the importance of the agreement being fair and
                                equitable to the Liberian Government.</item>

                            <item>Mr. Young.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Following the conference in the Secretary’s office, the representatives
                            of the Firestone Company called for the purpose of further discussing
                            the terms of the proposed agreements.</p>
                        <p>(1) Mr. Harrison stated that the Department felt that the period proposed
                            during which Agreement No. 2 might be in effect, i. e., 99 years, with
                            an option to extend it for 50 years more, was excessive. <pb n="388"
                                xml:id="pg_388" facs="0470"/>It was pointed out that it might be in
                            the interest of the company, as well as of the Liberian Government, to
                            have a briefer term and some more flexible arrangement with respect to
                            fiscal relations between the company and the Government. The
                            representatives of the company agreed that the periods were too long,
                            and suggested that they would give consideration to finding a formula
                            which would shorten the maximum period to not over 99 years, and would
                            embody some provisions for adjustment of fiscal relations. Mr. Firestone
                            was not certain which type of arrangement he would prefer. The following
                            general types of arrangements were discussed: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>A concession for 50 years, with an option to renew for a
                                    further period up to 99 years, such option to be exercised at
                                    any time after a fixed period, say 10 or 25 years:</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>A year term concession, such as 99 years, with provisions for
                                    adjusting the fiscal relations periodically, e. g., at the end
                                    of 50 years and each 10 years thereafter.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Mr. Firestone stated that after more careful consideration he would
                            indicate to the Department the changes he would suggest as to the above
                            point.</p>
                        <p>(2) It was also pointed out that the contract provided that no tax on the
                            exportation of rubber should be paid when the New York price was less
                            than 15 cents per pound. It was suggested that, without being able to
                            know what might be the future course of the price of rubber in the light
                            of possible technical and other developments, it might be better to omit
                            the provision exempting the company from the tax when the price fell
                            below 15 cents. Mr. Firestone stated that he recognized that the tax in
                            such a case would be almost negligible as a factor in the company’s
                            business, and indicated that he would probably eliminate reference to
                            the 15 cent limit.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the question of adjusting fiscal arrangements, mention
                            was made of the possibility of some form of arbitration, e. g., the
                            Liberian Government to appoint one arbitrator, the company to appoint
                            one and the Secretary of State to appoint a third.</p>
                        <p>(3) Reference was made to the proposed loan, which Mr. Firestone thinks
                            may perhaps eventually be obtained from this Government. Mr. Harrison
                            pointed out that it is important that the Liberian Government should not
                            in any way be led to believe that the Government of the United States is
                            making any commitment with respect to such a loan. It was further
                            pointed out that the Department in the past had not made it a practice
                            of going farther, in the case of private loans to Governments of certain
                            Latin-American countries, than to assist by agreeing to facilitate the
                            settlement of disputes by appointment of an arbitrator, and, with
                            respect to supervision of loans, to lend its good offices in connection
                            with the selection of a supervisor of customs revenues.</p>
                        <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0471"/>
                        <p>(4) Mr. Firestone and Mr. Miller indicated that they would take under
                            advisement the points raised, and would communicate further with the
                            Department in due course.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            letter of December 10, 1924, and of the three draft agreements covering
                            your proposed enterprise in Liberia which have been revised since my
                            talk with you last week and were handed to Mr. Harrison by
                            representatives of your company on December 18. In submitting these
                            draft agreements to the Department, you asked to be advised whether they
                            contain anything which would prevent this Government from giving your
                            undertaking its moral support and approval. You also inquire concerning
                            “the protection afforded the rights of both parties from a contractual
                            and international standpoint”.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I wish to say that I fully appreciate the importance of
                            developing independent sources of rubber supply under American control,
                            and trust that your enterprise may contribute to that end. With
                            reference to your inquiry whether the enterprise would receive the
                            support of this Department, I may state that it is not the policy of the
                            Department of State to obtain or negotiate concessions for American
                            citizens, although the Department is always desirous to <pb n="404"
                                xml:id="pg_404" facs="0486"/>maintain free and equal opportunity for
                            American enterprise throughout the world. There appears to be nothing in
                            the contracts submitted by you which is opposed to the interests or
                            policies of this Government or which would preclude this Department from
                            giving appropriate moral support. It should be understood, of course,
                            that the Government assumes no obligations and the investment must be
                            made at the risk of those engaged in the enterprise. While I cannot
                            presume to bind my successors in office, I may say that it has been and
                            is the policy of the Department when controversies arise to lend proper
                            support of a diplomatic character to claims of American citizens
                            wherever these claims appear to be founded on international law and
                            justice.</p>
                        <p>I note that Agreement No. 2 contains in Article IV, paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">k</hi>), a statement to the effect that you will use
                            your best efforts to obtain for Liberia a loan either from the
                            Government of the United States or from some other person or persons. In
                            this connection, it should be clearly understood that this statement in
                            the contract and what I have said above must not be taken by the
                            Government of Liberia or in any other quarter to mean that I intend to
                            reopen the question of a government loan or that any committal in this
                            respect is involved.</p>
                        <p>Subject to the foregoing, I take pleasure in informing you that this
                            Department, in the light of the information before it, perceives no
                            objection to your proceeding to negotiate an agreement in the matter
                            with the Government of the Republic of Liberia on the lines set forth in
                            the draft agreements submitted to this Department.</p>

                                agreement provisions were made a part of a separate agreement. They
                                are perfectly willing to have the two Agreements so worded as to

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to herewith
                                submit for your Excellency’s consideration, at the request of the
                                Secretary of State of Liberia, an opinion on the Firestone
                                Agreements mentioned above.</p>

                                <item>In order that my attitude may be clear, I should like to
                                    explain that my present intention is to discuss the matter as a
                                    question of principle rather than from the view point of
                                    minutely examining the detail. In my opinion, the question of
                                    the detail is insignificant in a subject of the magnitude and
                                    far reaching effect that a Concessionary Agreement of this class
                                    must be to all of the officials, citizens and inhabitants of
                                    this country. Should it come to be ascertained that the
                                    Executive Government of the Republic finds itself in accord with
                                    the principles embodied in the Agreement, then the detail
                                    becomes important only as a matter of phraseology or
                                    expression.</item>

                                    by the delivery of three completely executed Agreements, I see
                                    the question before the Executive Government of Liberia as
                                    divided into three great principles:— <list>

                                <item>The first principle (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The Acceptance
                                    of American Economic Influence, is the foundation stone of the
                                    other two. To a student of economics and equally to a student of
                                    diplomacy and affairs, modern civilization appears divided into
                                    certain great economic fields, each with certain characteristic
                                    peculiarities. Ancient civilization never comprehended an
                                    economic field separated from the sovereignty or dominion of the
                                    dominant nation in each field, but today the world has
                                    progressed to the use of trade agreements, special exemptions
                                    and financial systems which render it perfectly possible for
                                    groups of peoples moving in certain economic fields to preserve
                                    their own sovereignty and government and yet from the point of
                                    view of commerce, to be as indissoluble as if they were citizens
                                    of the same country or men of the same blood and race.</item>

                                <item>The economic field of Germany, before the war, was an example
                                    of this. German commercial dominion was recognized among many
                                    nations. It was when the German military caste sought to return
                                    to the principles of the ancient world and unite commercial
                                    supremacy to sovereignty, that Germany saw the careful
                                    commercial up-building of many years swept into ruin. Today,
                                    Germany deprived of her colonies and deprived of her former
                                    sources of raw material, compelled to buy in the world’s market
                                    and to borrow her very capital from her late antagonists,
                                    presents an uncertain future. Germany may become modern,
                                    democratic and a safe neighbor. Germany may revert to her war
                                    ideals and become a military autocracy again endangering those
                                    people with whom she deals. The desire for colonial possessions
                                    in Africa is evident and her increasing power will render her
                                    diplomacy more and more determined in its efforts to this end. I
                                    am convinced that at this time, seeing the future no more
                                    clearly than we do, entering into the post war German economic
                                    field would be unsafe for a country whose strength is yet
                                    undeveloped.</item>

                                <item>France has presented to the world an unwavering economic
                                    policy of colonial possession, and then and only then,
                                    development. Broadly speaking, one may examine the map of the
                                    world and find <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0491"
                                    />relatively little French capital invested in any country other
                                    than a country which by some system of government is in fact a
                                    French Colony or Protectorate. France suffered as a country more
                                    during the late war than any of her allies excluding Belgium.
                                    Today, we see her with depreciated currency struggling to obtain
                                    some share of the promised compensation for her damages with but
                                    little available capital for the development of her very large
                                    share of the world. To enter definitely into the French economic
                                    field would not appear to offer hope of that capital investment
                                    which the resources of this country require if they are to be
                                    brought into service for its citizens.</item>

                                <item>The British Empire is the next great economic force in the
                                    world and English capital has developed country after country
                                    and territory after territory with little or no regard of the
                                    question of the sovereign power so long as an honorable and
                                    stable government was maintained in the place where English
                                    capital was to be used. Even the United States sought English
                                    capital and the great transcontinental railroad lines of America
                                    were largely built from English sources. The British Empire,
                                    therefore, appears from this point of view, a safe and desirable
                                    field in which the Republic of Liberia might seek to obtain the
                                    necessary capital for its development.</item>
                                <label>7.</label>
                                <item>On the other hand, the Republic of Liberia is a plantation
                                    country. It may have mineral sources of great value but they
                                    have never been accurately located. There is not a mine in
                                    actual operation from the many concessions that have been given,
                                    and if one examines the Export Statistics of the country, one
                                    finds that the people of the country have turned to the export
                                    of palmoil, palm kernels, fibre, coffee and rubber. It is a law
                                    of economics that is well recognized, that people of any
                                    country, community or environment, will tend to produce always
                                    that thing which their environment most profitably and easily
                                    produces. The proof, therefore, today of Liberian resources has
                                    been definitely given on the subject of plantation production
                                    and it is yet to be obtained on minerals or manufactured
                                    goods.</item>
                                <label>8.</label>
                                <item>In my opinion, therefore, Liberia should seek and must seek an
                                    alliance with capital in an economic field whose effort is
                                    toward the development of plantation products of a character
                                    which experience has shown can be easily and profitably produced
                                    in Liberia.</item>
                                <label>9.</label>
                                <item>If one examines the world’s statistics, the British Empire
                                    already produces more than 80% of the plantation rubber produced
                                    in the world. We find British industries seeking to sell rubber
                                    rather than to buy. The same in effect holds good for all
                                    plantation products, the British Empire being the best balanced
                                    as well as the most self-contained existing economic field.
                                    Capital alliance with the British Empire field must therefore be
                                    sought in competition with British industry, if it is to be
                                    obtained at all.</item>

                                <item>The next great world economic field is that of the United
                                    States of America which includes many nations not under American
                                    dominion. An examination of the world’s products bought and
                                    interchanged by this field shows that the consumption by
                                    industry is greater than its production of raw products. We find
                                    70% of the British Empire rubber production bought by this
                                    field; we find other tropical products equally sought.
                                    Logically, therefore, the Liberian Republic should expect to
                                    obtain a better consideration in an alliance with the American
                                    economic field than with those groups which I have compared
                                    above.</item>

                                <item>In discussing the question of the principle of world economic
                                    fields, I have approached the subject from a detached point of
                                    view taking no notice of the local sentiment or desires of the
                                    citizens of the Republic. It would be perhaps unfair to refrain
                                    from recalling the historical association between the United
                                    States and Liberia and the very natural tendency of the citizens
                                    of this Republic to look with favor on an economic alliance with
                                    a group whose colony they consider themselves to have been, this
                                    association being mutually appreciated as the political history
                                    of Liberia so frequently records.</item>

                                    Development of Liberia has been already accepted as the
                                    expressed policy of the present Administration. The interior has
                                    been partially opened to foreign trade, the draft Agreements
                                    exchanged with the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company in June

                                    Agreement, the Mining Laws of 1923/24, the Highway Act of
                                    1924/25, and other laws, regulations and privileges demonstrate
                                    the attitude of this Government on this point beyond question or
                                    need of discussion. The Firestone Agreement No. 2, however, as
                                    now modified, brings into question two principles inasmuch as
                                    the inducement suggested as being necessary to permit this

                                    certain public works, educational, agricultural and other

                                    develop the natural resources of the country may appear to be
                                    somewhat different from the idea of obtaining a foreign loan.
                                    Actually this is not so as the loan and the public works
                                    resulting, offer in themselves a part of the inducement desired.
                                    The question of a loan, its desirability and necessity as
                                    distinguished from ordinary inducements to foreign capital, I

                                    question may appear to be very closely allied with the question
                                    of entry into the American economic field and yet in a strict
                                    sense it is only recently that this has been so considered. The
                                    people of Liberia originally sought aid from America in order to
                                    establish themselves on this coast and repel the native
                                    tribesmen, and that aid was forthcoming through the American
                                    Colonization Society. Later, there was a decided attempt to
                                    unite this country with the United States of America either as a
                                    territory or in the form of a protectorate. These attempts to
                                    make closer the association between the two countries were never
                                    based on the desire for the development of the country’s
                                    resources. They were purely and simply attempts to secure
                                    protection of a stronger power on the part of a weaker power who
                                    felt that it needed that protection in order to develop its
                                    strength; that it needed protection in order to be able to turn
                                    its ideas to any other things than war and self-defence. In
                                    1917, this idea was again expressed by the Liberian Republic in
                                    the original 1917 loan, or in the “American Program” as it was
                                        called.<note n="17a" xml:id="d344fn17a">See <ref

                                <item>In 1921, there was a different feeling shown in the relations
                                    between the United States of America and Liberia because the
                                    relationship contemplated under the 1921 loan agreement
                                    incorporated the idea of economic development although the idea
                                    of protection was never lost sight of. The loan was defeated in
                                    the Senate of the United States and the Liberian Government
                                    followed your Excellency’s idea of not seeking a foreign loan
                                    until this country had shown its ability to succeed or had at
                                    least demonstrated its ability to develop to such an extent that
                                    the Executive Government could exactly determine the degree of
                                    necessity of a foreign loan.</item>

                                <item>In 1923, upon my return from Europe, your Excellency had
                                    decided that in spite of the very manifest and successful
                                    efforts of the people of this country, it was apparent that a
                                    certain protection on one hand and assistance on the other were
                                    necessary if the people were to be satisfied and not discouraged
                                    by the slowness of their effort and the lack of sympathy
                                    manifested in certain foreign quarters. I refer particularly to
                                    your Excellency’s communication addressed to the Honorable Fred

                                    fixation of American interest in this country if public works
                                    and other development was [<hi rend="italic">were</hi>] to be
                                    undertaken through the assistance of a foreign loan obtained in

                                    United States, I ascertained that the present resources of this
                                    country were not sufficient to offer very much security to
                                    bankers and it seemed to be inevitable that a loan obtained
                                    through private bankers must be at a high premium and must to a
                                    great extent carry itself from its own capital for the first
                                    several years before the resources of the country could be
                                    expected to be developed.</item>

                                <item>If your Excellency will recall, I pointed out that the
                                    investment of the very large amount of capital offered by the
                                    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company for plantation development
                                    would at once put a different phase in this situation. The
                                    amounts that the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company offered to
                                    pay the Government form but a small percentage of the benefit to
                                    the Government. I mean that the employment of some thousands of
                                    laborers, the increased use of the roads, the increased calls of
                                    ships to handle the export, the increased demand for skilled
                                    labor, and the putting into circulation of many hundreds of
                                    thousands of dollars annually, mean a swelling of the income of
                                    the Government in every direction not only from the ability of
                                    the citizens to pay taxes but from their increased consumption
                                    of necessities and luxuries. A condition of economic prosperity
                                    to thousands of individuals in this country obviously puts a
                                    different face on the aspect of a foreign loan so far as the
                                    ability to meet its obligations is concerned.</item>

                                <item>The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company came to Liberia
                                    seeking three things as the foundation on which it could
                                    determine whether it could do business in this country
                                    profitably and successfully. The first question to be considered
                                    was, could the Republic produce rubber, that is, was its
                                    rainfall, its climate and its soil suited to rubber
                                    production.</item>

                                <item>The second question to be considered was, granted that the
                                    first was satisfactory, was the Government animated by a desire
                                    to have such a development and if so, would it express that
                                    attitude concretely in the form of satisfactory terms which
                                    would permit production on a competitive basis with the Far East
                                    and Brazil.</item>
                                <label>21.</label>
                                <item>The third question was security. In other words, if the rain
                                    and the climate and the soil, after experimentation was decided
                                    to be suitable for rubber production, and if the country was
                                    prepared to grant terms which permit competitive production,
                                    then came the third and last question which determines whether
                                    or not this Company will carry on its affairs in Liberia. That
                                    question was and is, is the territorial sovereignty of Liberia
                                    secured. Or, putting the question in another way, can this
                                    Company assure itself of the continuation of the Government of
                                    Liberia as a stable, autonomous Government.</item>

                                    part of the proper and ordinary cost of the production of rubber

                                    appear to digress somewhat from the subject under discussion.
                                    Nevertheless, it is not so, because the study which the
                                    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company has made of Liberian
                                    conditions has brought that Company, as evidenced by its new

                                    your Excellency to re-open the conversations with the United

                                    letter to the Honorable Fred Morris Dearing above referred to,
                                    and in a conference had with the writer in November 1924 the

                                <item>We must presume from the fact that after having had experts
                                    examine the conditions in Liberia, the Firestone Company has
                                    submitted completed and signed proposals, that the question as
                                    to rainfall, climate and soil has been answered satisfactorily;
                                    that as an analysis of the new agreements shows relatively
                                    little change from the terms of the original draft Agreements
                                    tentatively offered last June, that the question as to the
                                    willingness of the Government and Legislators is considered to
                                    be entirely satisfactory and even were this not so, the action
                                    of the last Legislature definitely proves the willingness and
                                    desire of the people of this Republic to offer what appears to
                                    be fair terms to the investment of foreign capital. I am
                                    perfectly aware that certain comparatively new paragraphs have
                                    been inserted in these Agreements and some changes made in the

                                    of principles and are matters for discussion after the larger

                                <item>There then remains the third question, that of security.
                                    Security comprehends not only the autonomy of this nation, but
                                    more, it means that the progress and administration of national
                                    affairs shall continue in an orderly fashion. Very obviously no
                                    large capital investment from foreign sources can be expected
                                    unless prospective investors can be fully satisfied on these
                                    points. I remember, when I was in Washington, the Firestone
                                    Company sent some representatives to interview one of the higher
                                    officers there and asked the question, what protection could the
                                    Company expect if it invested its capital in Liberia. For an
                                    answer, the Company was referred to the existing treaties: that
                                    of Commerce and Amity, containing the <pb n="414"
                                        xml:id="pg_414" facs="0496"/>most favored nation clause
                                    represented the only conditions under which the United States
                                    Government could exercise any interference or protection in this
                                    country. Questions have been asked as to public works
                                    development and as to the ability of this country to build
                                    roads, bridges and maintain a duly qualified Physician and
                                    medical force for Sanitary purposes, and to these questions, and
                                    to others of like character, the replies have not been
                                    satisfactory because the country has not been financially able
                                    to do these things from its current revenues nor is there any
                                    prospect of it being able to do these things for the next
                                    several years to come unless a loan is sought. To an analysis of
                                    the existing conditions, therefore, only one answer could be
                                    made, namely, that from some source if these things were to be
                                    done, a loan must be secured.</item>

                                <item>The conditions of the granting of loans to small countries
                                    throughout the world are matters of public record and the
                                    reference works of the big financial institutions render them
                                    easy of access for any one seeking information thereon. Looking
                                    at these terms and at the fact that almost inevitably they
                                    provide for foreign advisers, foreign officials, or control and
                                    administrative officers appointed by foreign banks and
                                    Governments, it appears to be only logical and to be expected
                                    that conditions and terms for Liberia, where conditions and
                                    circumstances are analogous to these other countries, would be
                                    similar. It was inevitable that the question should be asked by
                                    the Firestone Company, would this new element which it foresaw
                                    must become a factor in Liberian affairs be a force which would
                                    fit into the economic field in which it was conceived Liberia
                                    would be entering. What nation would furnish it and for what
                                    reasons. What conditions would be imposed. Would they interfere
                                    with the plantation business in this country.</item>

                                <item>Looking at the history of Liberia’s relations with the United
                                    States, the most important point would be the 1921 Loan
                                    Agreement. This Agreement had been considered satisfactory to
                                    Liberia. It had been signed by its highest officials and it had
                                    become a law by virtue of the approval of the Liberian
                                    Legislature of 1921/22. This Loan Agreement saddled the country
                                    with no charges for floatation. It aimed at development, it
                                    provided impartial officials and what was more important,
                                    possibly, was the fact that by virtue of the Memorandum entered
                                    into at Versailles in July 1919 by Representatives of Great
                                    Britain, France, the United States and Liberia, it recognized on
                                    the part of Great Britain and France the close association
                                    between Liberia and the United States of America; the right of
                                    Liberia to call on the United States as its next friend and the
                                    right of the United States to answer that call. As a diplomatic
                                    foundation, it was perfect.</item>

                                <item>As I see the situation, the only thing that could be done
                                    which would at once place both the Republic of Liberia and the
                                    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company’s investment in the position
                                    of security desired was to attempt to revive the conditions that
                                    existed at the time the 1921 Loan Agreement was in
                                    contemplation, and to do this, the consent of the American State
                                    Department had to be sought. Would the Secretary of State of the
                                    United States again assume the obligations to be assumed by the
                                    American State Department under the loan plan of 1921? That the
                                    answer to this, by the American Secretary of State was
                                    favourable, cannot be doubted from the fact that the Firestone
                                    Company is content to offer signed Agreements. Further, I have
                                    been informed by Mr. Hines that his Company is in possession of
                                    a letter from the American Secretary of State on this
                                        subject,<note n="19" xml:id="d344fn19"><hi rend="italic"

                                    although I have not seen the letter. Since that consent of Mr.
                                    Hughes has been secured, Mr. Hughes has resigned. Mr. Hughes’
                                    successor will of course feel himself as morally and ethically
                                    bound by Mr. Hughes consent, but whether he will consider
                                    himself so obligated should new modifications render it
                                    necessary to re-submit these Agreements to the State Department
                                    remains to be seen. The first is a question which may be
                                    regarded as settled, the second is a situation calling for an
                                    expression from the new Secretary as to his own determined
                                    policy which may or may not be the same as that of Mr. Hughes.
                                    It is a new factor in the situation and one that must be
                                    considered.</item>

                                    of 1921 in the present Agreements, from the view-point of
                                    principle, I find the idea excellent and the advantage to
                                    Liberia is an advantage which is greater than Liberia has ever
                                    sought in her previous negotiations, although obviously, it is
                                    the advantage which it was hoped the public works and progress
                                    planned under the 1921 loan might in its last result bring to
                                    the citizens of this country. To express myself clearly, I mean,
                                    that the Firestone Company’s plan incorporates in one single
                                    Agreement, commercial prosperity to the merchants, the
                                    employment of thousands of citizens, revenues to the country
                                    both direct and indirect, and lastly, a foreign loan for
                                    immediate public works, education and various other things which
                                    this country ardently desires.</item>

                                    Excellency to the same conclusion at which I have arrived, that
                                    is, that inasmuch as the amount of money specifically mentioned
                                    in the Firestone Agreement, viz:—two to five million dollars, is
                                    a reduction of the original 1921 loan plan, it must mean a
                                    corresponding reduction in the number of foreign employees and
                                    in certain other of the disbursement and expenditure clauses

                                    suggestions on certain aspects and phases of this situation

                                    them to be so far from the Administration’s desires and ideals
                                    as to be incompatible with the plans for the progress of this

                            considered premature prior to approval of rubber concession. However,

                        <p>I note Mr. Wall, who is Acting Minister to Liberia,<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d346fn25">Wall was actually clerk in charge of the Legation
                                at Monrovia.</note> stated that the Cabinet objected to loan
                            negotiation clause being included in the Agreements, but that the
                            Liberian Secretary of State believes authorization for loan agreement on
                            same terms except reducing the number of control officers and
                            modifications on other points necessary by reason of reduced amount,
                            might be entered into as separate document.</p>
                        <p>I have special reasons why I do not want any change made in the loan
                            agreement. As you realize, to negotiate a new loan agreement would take
                            time and in my appeal for investment of capital it will be very helpful
                            to refer to the loan agreement that was negotiated by the United States
                            Government, but when we actually come to make the loan agreement, the
                            United States Government agreement would simply be a guide and we could
                            eliminate any uneconomical or objectionable features that should be
                            eliminated, and this would only form as a basis on which a loan will be
                            made them. I trust that you will urge upon American representatives in
                            Liberia to do everything in their power to have the Agreement accepted
                            as it is, and at as early a date as possible.</p>
                        <p>I note that Mr. Wall also asks for statistical information on rubber
                            companies payments to other governments for plantation privileges <pb

                            believe it advisable for either Liberian Government or ourselves to send
                            such figures as it will only tend to bring up an argument and place them
                            in the hands of people in Liberia who are not interested in having our
                            Agreements approved by the Liberian Government.</p>

                            the best interest of all.</p>
                        <p>I believe it will be interesting to you to know that I sent Mr. Felber to
                            see Secretary Hoover and advise him that if they would modify the Middle
                            East Rubber Survey report and possibly the Philippine report that we
                            would be glad to cooperate with the Department of Commerce Rubber Survey
                            and furnish them reports on surveys we made in the Philippine Islands,
                            Mexico, Central America and Liberia, and endeavor to make the United
                            States Government Rubber Survey the basis on which rubber planting by
                            America was started. After very careful consideration I decided that if
                            Secretary Hoover would give us the right cooperation that it would work
                            out very much better for American interests.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know if you realize it, but with the restriction on production
                            there is already a shortage of rubber and the price is advancing
                            steadily. Therefore, it is important that we get into active operation
                            at as early a date as possible.</p>
                        <p>I am having a most delightful vacation here on Miami Beach—the playground
                            of the world. On my return will be in Washington about the 3d of April
                            and I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you.</p>

                            has discussed loan provision with Firestone informally. Firestone not
                            willing that any change be made in loan provision in agreement which he
                            considers an important factor in raising large capital. He states that
                            any objectionable or uneconomic features of 1921 loan plan can be
                            eliminated or changed later when the loan agreement is actually
                            effected. He has cabled Hines in this sense.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. De la Rue</hi>: In answer to the
                            telegram of February 25th from the Legation, in which you ask
                            statistical information on rubber companies’ payments to governments,
                            etc., I pass on the following:</p>
                        <p>In the first place, the Department of Commerce is making a survey of the
                            crude rubber situation, but this survey has not yet been put into such
                            form that publication is possible. Commerce states, however, that there
                            is some information as to land rents per acre.</p>
                        <p>In British Malaya, the price goes up to $2.00; in Sumatra, it is about 8
                            cents for the first year, rising to 48 cents in the sixth and following
                            years; in Cochin China, it is 29 cents; in Java, 21 cents; in Borneo,
                            free for the first six years, 25 cents for the next four years and
                            thereafter $2.00; in the Philippines the annual rent is 3 per cent of
                            the appraised value of the land, subject to change every ten years. The
                            British Colonies have an export tax of one cent a pound, but in all
                            other countries there is no export tax whatever.</p>
                        <p>As to the length of the leases, those in Sumatra are for 75 years,
                            subject to renewal of 50 years more, the area is unlimited; in British
                            Malaya there are unlimited areas and the leases are in perpetuity; in
                            the Philippines the leases are limited to 2,530 acres for 25 years,
                            subject to renewal for two additional periods of 25 years each.</p>
                        <p>It should be pointed out, however, that the question immediately arises
                            as to whether the foregoing figures fairly constitute comparable
                            statistics. The territories mentioned are proven ground and may perhaps
                            not properly be compared with Liberia where the possibility of
                            successful production has not been demonstrated. We have no idea what
                            rents and taxes, if any, were imposed originally in these territories
                            since such figures, if available, have not been furnished us. The best
                            comparison would, as you will see, necessarily be with rents and taxes
                            in absolutely new and untried areas.</p>
                        <p>Other facts also are to be taken into consideration and with regard to
                            some of these Liberia may be at a disadvantage. Labor must be taken into
                            consideration, also shipping and other communication facilities,
                            climatic conditions, etc.</p>
                        <p>The Department hopes strongly that a suitable agreement may be reached.
                            It is my own hope that even before this letter reaches you the contracts
                            may have been made effective. It is very clear that if such agreements
                            can be reached and if in consequence successful production of rubber is
                            effected, this would tend not only to benefit <pb n="420"
                                xml:id="pg_420" facs="0502"/>American consumers of rubber who are
                            now dependent on a foreign controlled supply, but also must be of very
                            great material advantage to Liberia, both economically and financially
                            regardless of the immediate or direct financial benefits accruing to the
                            country through the contracts.</p>
                        <p>The Department will, of course, forward to you the Commerce survey of the
                            situation when and if it is published. I cannot help feeling that it
                            would be very unfortunate to supply figures as to rent, etc. to the
                            Liberian Government without proper comment which would point out the
                            possible, if not probable, differences in the situation there and in
                            countries where the commercial production of rubber has been proved
                            profitable.</p>

                        <p>7. Firestone said in a recent talk with an officer of the Department that
                            he has cabled Hines to urge ratification of contracts by April 15.
                            Firestone anxious to begin immediately large scale operations which will
                            be of great advantage to Liberia in development of industry, port of
                            Monrovia and roads. Please inform Department promptly when contracts are
                            ratified. Department hopes early agreement may be reached on
                            satisfactory basis.</p>

                            follows: Department’s continued solicitude and interest in Liberia shown
                            by the careful examination and approval of Firestone contracts; by the
                            prolonged stay of Minister in the United States until such careful and
                            favorable consideration should be given; by personal conferences at the
                            Department to enable the Minister to represent to the Liberian
                            Government Department’s benevolent interest in this matter to the extent
                            that the Department was desirous of giving such moral support as would
                            aid Liberian rehabilitation. The Department considered the Firestone
                            contracts as a means through <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0503"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honour to advise you that the
                            Government of Liberia have given due consideration to the Agreements in
                            relation to your Principal’s prospective rubber and other enterprises in
                            Liberia which were submitted by you on the 19th of February, 1925,<note
                                n="27a" xml:id="d351fn27a">See drafts, <ref target="#pg_389">pp.
                                    389</ref>–<ref target="#pg_403">403</ref>.</note> and are of the
                            opinion that the Agreements, with the exceptions hereinafter noted,
                            furnish acceptable bases for their endorsement of the Firestone
                            operations in the Republic.</p>
                        <p>The Government regret exceedingly to find themselves unable to accept
                            these Agreements in their entirety. The reason for this, is that a very
                            careful examination of them discloses the surprising fact that in
                            aspects which the Government of Liberia consider fundamental they depart
                            from the understanding reached as a result of the protracted
                            negotiations last year when in a letter to the Secretary of State dated
                            June 19, 1924,<note n="28" xml:id="d351fn28"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_368">p. 368</ref>.</note> he was given
                            to understand by you that the documents then submitted by him
                            represented terms and conditions mutually acceptable. This impression
                            was emphasized by Mr. Firestone’s cablegram to President King dated
                            December 24, 1924,<note n="29" xml:id="d351fn29">Not found in Department
                                files.</note> by which His Excellency was advised in express terms
                            that the Agreements were approved.</p>
                        <p>By these unqualified declarations the President was led to submit to the
                            Liberian Legislature the Agreements arrived at in 1924. This Department
                            of the Government gave the necessary approval to the executory
                            agreements and authorized the Executive to execute them substantially in
                            the form in which they had been submitted.</p>
                        <p>Up to the approval of the Agreements by the Legislature this Government
                            was of the opinion that the mutuality which is a necessary <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0504"/>prerequisite to all agreements, existed
                            between your Principals and them. The introduction of matters into the
                            documents you have recently submitted, matters which at the time of our
                            first discussions were neither directly nor even remotely suggested or
                            contemplated,—destroys in large measure our previous understandings and,
                            unless eliminated would tend to reopen the discussion as to terms and
                            conditions.</p>
                        <p>The Government would consider this as undesirable in every point of view,
                            and are therefore willing and ready, as I have already intimated to sign
                            an agreement from which the unforeseen provisions have been
                            eliminated.</p>
                        <p>I desire to make it clear that the objections to which I am referring
                            have no relations at all to the rents, royalties or rate of revenue tax
                            which your Principal or his assigns might have to pay; for the
                            Government are not desirous of imposing any conditions which would
                            render it economically impossible for you to produce rubber in
                            competition with other rubber producing countries. The principal
                            objections which are found to your proposals are: <list>

                                    an indirect relation. The other exemptions included in your
                                    proposals under this clause are too far-reaching for the
                                    Government to bind themselves in the terms there stated. It is
                                    hoped that this provision will remain as stated in the

                                    your Company. This is a matter of fundamental policy and it is
                                    hoped you will not insist upon provisions which would embarrass
                                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0505"/>the Government in

                                    Principal. This provision carries within it the elements of
                                    future misunderstandings. This is undesirable. The Government
                                    desire an agreement which will, as far as possible, be automatic
                                    in its working and prefer even at the risk of some future loss
                                    not to introduce conditions that have to be interpreted,
                                    construed and eventually submitted to the final arbitrament of a

                                    shall be at a flat rate which should obtain during the life of
                                    the Agreement.</item>

                                <item>It is thought that the ultimate clauses of paragraph (<hi

                                    open to exception on the ground that they represent an attempted
                                    restraint upon certain inherent sovereign powers of this
                                    Government and imply the existence within this Republic of a
                                    condition of tax aberration which is not in accord with fact nor
                                    conforms to our ideas of ordered Government. The provision of
                                    the original Agreement in this point of view would therefore
                                    seem to be preferable, as under it all details might be worked
                                    out in accord with the Treasury Department.</item>

                                    difficult to understand, if the Government’s view is correct,
                                    why clause (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) of Article III should

                                    every point of view. But this Government would find itself
                                    embarrassed if they were to use the intermediation of a private
                                    concern operating in Liberia under grants from the Government
                                    for this purpose, and if they were to secure the loan upon the
                                    condition of an agreement the terms of which are impracticable.
                                    Your Principal, however, may be assured that, recognizing as the

                                    development, they will use every endeavour within the next few
                                    years with the assistance of the American Department of State to
                                    secure in America, if possible, funds necessary for this
                                    purpose, provided the terms and the conditions be such as may be
                                    satisfactory to the Legislature of Liberia. They will have no
                                    objection to those interested in your proposals giving any
                                    assistance or participating in the flotation of such a loan. In
                                    view of this assurance, the Government would be pleased if you
                                    could appreciate their point of view and understanding why they
                                    must insist upon the elimination of clause (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: In view of the interest which
                            your Department of State has taken in the proposals made by Harvey S.
                            Firestone to this Government, I deem it advisable to acquaint you with
                            the present posture of this affair in order that you might be
                            authoritatively informed of the views of the Liberian Government. For
                            this purpose I herewith enclose a copy of the letter which I addressed
                            Mr. Hines yesterday,<note n="31" xml:id="d352fn31"><hi rend="italic"
                                    >Supra.</hi></note> and desire by this present dispatch to
                            emphasize the observations made in my letter to Mr. Firestone’s
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>As I had occasion to observe in that letter the matter of direct money
                            returns from Mr. Firestone’s operations in Liberia is of minor concern
                            to this Government. Frankly, what it has been hoped the Republic would
                            gain from the encouragement of large American investments in the country
                            is a counterpois[e] to other menacingly aggressive interests already
                            established in this country, a balancing of foreign influences here and
                            a new economic impulse.</p>
                        <p>Influenced by these ideas the Government have been disposed to be as
                            liberal in the grant of rights in connection with rubber-production as
                            is consistent with their views of the present [and] future interests of
                            the country.</p>
                        <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0507"/>
                        <p>There are, however, several provisions in the Agreements brought out by
                            Mr. Hines which were neither contemplated nor even remotely suggested in
                            the discussions I had the honour of having with that gentleman in June
                            last year. The understandings we then arrived at were stated both by him
                            and his Principal as being acceptable terms upon which the prospective
                            Lessee could operate in Liberia. The new provisions have been encouched
                            in the Agreements without any notice to this Government and without any
                            previous ascertainment of their possible acceptance. Nevertheless, upon
                            the arrival of Mr. Hines with, in some respect, absolutely new terms,
                            the Liberian Government is expected to place its signature to them
                            without even exercising the right of considering their bearing upon the
                            national interests as this Government interprets them.</p>
                        <p>The most important of these new proposals is that relating to the
                            question of a loan. The fundamental position which the Liberian
                            Government take upon this question is that it is politically inadvisable
                            in their view to place the Republic under financial obligations to any
                            private concern operating in the country under grants from the
                            Government. This is a line of policy from which there can be no
                            departure. Secondly, in the changed conditions which now obtain in the
                            country, no loan could be negotiated with a private concern upon the
                            terms and conditions of the Agreement negotiated by the Liberian Mission
                            to the United States in 1921. The reason being that any rights the
                            Liberian Government, for political purposes, would be willing with every
                            confidence to accord to the Government of the United States, or any
                            obligations which they would be willing to assume <hi rend="italic"
                                >vis-a-vis</hi> said Government, they could find themselves able
                            neither to accord nor undertake towards a private concern, however well
                            recommended. Bearing this in mind you can easily see why it has been
                            urged that the question of a loan be taken up in a separate Agreement in
                            which the terms and conditions could be worked out, and that it be
                            eliminated from the present Agreement in which it has no logical
                            place.</p>
                        <p>I have to emphasize the point that the Government of Liberia do not
                            refuse the assistance of the American State Department in securing the
                            funds necessary to the rapid development of internal works of public
                            utility. On the contrary my Government would be more than appreciative
                            of any benevolent assistance in this direction of which they might be
                            recipients. They nevertheless must urge that the money be secured from
                            sources other than a corporation or individual operating commercially in
                            Liberia, and upon terms and conditions which would be practical, and
                            would also be likely to meet with acceptance by the people of this
                            country.</p>

                            <p>I am having difficulty in securing signature of Liberian Government
                                to the rubber planting agreements which were approved by the State
                                Department. I am asking Mr. W. R. Castle for assistance. Knowing

                                advising you of the situation. Personal regards.</p>

                        <p>8. Your 11, April 24, 11 a.m.</p>
                        <p>(1) Department presumes you have sufficiently made clear, as explained to
                            you while in Washington, that loan by this Government is impossible and
                            that the Department, while hoping that a proper basis may be found on
                            which Firestone and the Liberian Government might agree with reference
                            to the concessions in question, and while in principle perceiving no
                            objection in the light of its present information to a loan for the
                            purpose of Liberian rehabilitation, must obviously reserve an expression
                            of its views until the specific terms of the loan contract have been
                            submitted to it. Department’s position in this regard was made clear to
                            Firestone at <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0509"/>the time
                            Department informed him that it had no objection to the draft
                            concession. Subsequently Firestone informed Department that any
                            objectionable or uneconomic features of 1921 loan plan referred to in
                            the loan clause of the draft contract could be eliminated or changed
                            later when the loan agreement is actually effected. You may make
                            discreet use of the foregoing in conversations with officials of the
                            Liberian Government if you think it advisable to do so.</p>
                        <p>(2) You may inform the Liberian Government in writing to the following
                            effect: The Department awaits with sympathetic interest the conclusion
                            of the Firestone contracts and earnestly believes that successful
                            establishment of the rubber industry in Liberia will tend to promote the
                            country’s welfare by contributing to the development of its resources
                            and open the door for further progress by bringing stimulus and
                            prosperity to the Liberian people. Mr. Firestone has assured the
                            Department that as soon as the contracts are in effect there will be
                            money available for necessary public works such as roads and ports.
                            Furthermore, the Department would be willing to give appropriate
                            assistance and at the request of Liberia and of the American interests
                            concerned would be prepared again to assist in the selection of a
                            Receiver General of Customs.</p>
                        <p>The interest of the Department in the conclusion of these contracts may
                            be taken by the Liberian Government as proof of its continuing friendly
                            interest in Liberia. It would seem, therefore, most unfortunate should a
                            disagreement as to the exact terms of a loan prevent or delay the
                            conclusion of a contract which will in all probability be of immense
                            advantage to Liberia.</p>
                        <p>(3) Please show this telegram to Hines and De la Rue for their
                            information.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: This Consulate General has the honor in
                            confirmation of its cablegram number 11, dated April 24, 1925, setting
                            forth the attitude of the Liberian Government on the Firestone
                            Agreements, to report as follows:</p>
                        <p>This Consulate General presented to the Liberian Government in the
                            strongest conservative manner possible, the Department’s hope that an
                            early agreement between them and the Firestone Co., might be reached on
                            a satisfactory basis, also Department’s interest in Liberia becoming a
                            rubber producing center. That this interest was <pb n="428"
                                xml:id="pg_428" facs="0510"/>not in any particular Company, but in
                            the general trade development of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It was further stated that even the-general trade development was not the
                            sole motive, but that the Department by this means desired to show its
                            benevolent interest in Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Since Liberia had already asked the assistance of the United States in a
                            way which not only involved financial aid, but moral support, the
                            Department having carefully gone over the Firestone contract felt that
                            all that had been previously contemplated in loan of 1921 might be
                            accomplished through these Firestone Agreements. That the Department so
                            far as it legitimately or consistently could, was anxious to use its
                            goodly [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] offices to aid in the rehabilitation
                            of Liberia.</p>
                        <p>Numerous conferences were held with the President &amp; Secretary of
                            State, who said they were very thankful to be reassured of the
                            benevolent interest of the American Government. That they needed a loan
                            and the United States was the only source to which they felt safe to
                            apply, but they seemed unalterably and unequivocally opposed to
                            arranging it with any Company doing business in this country. The effort
                            was very strenuously made by this Consulate to give the most positive
                            assurance of the honest motives and high moral standards of the
                            Firestone Company. This was met by the reply that there was no
                            disposition in any way to reflect upon this Company nor discredit its
                            sincere intentions, but no one could anticipate what changes in its
                            personnel might come in the future and that it was an established and
                            set principle of the Liberian Government from past unfortunate
                            experiences, not to place itself under obligations by contract to any
                            firm or corporation doing business in Liberia, by negotiating loans with
                            them.</p>
                        <p>When asked whether they had any objection to Mr. Firestone as an
                            individual, taking the lead in any group to raise the money and make the
                            loan, they answered positively, “We have none”.</p>
                        <p>They further say that there are terms and conditions in the loan of 1921
                            to which they could never again accede. That the present sentiment of
                            the country would not permit the signing of a loan agreement upon the
                            same terms and conditions of that of 1921. When told that the 1921 loan
                            agreement would serve as a model to follow and there necessarily would
                            be changes and modifications made in a loan now as compared with the
                            1921 terms and conditions, their reply was “Once they had signed this
                            contract with the stipulation as set forth in Agreement Number 2,
                            Article 4, paragraph <hi rend="italic">k</hi>, they could be required to
                            negotiate a loan agreement with the Firestone Company exactly upon all
                            the terms and conditions of the loan of five million dollars which was
                            contemplated in the proposed agreement between <pb n="429"
                                xml:id="pg_429" facs="0511"/>the Government of Liberia and the
                            Government of the United States in 1921. Another objection was, the
                            stipulation in agreement number 1, article 2, paragraph <hi

                        <p>13. Department’s cable 8, May 1, 6 p.m. The Government of Liberia desires
                            me to transmit the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Government of Liberia fully sensing and appreciating the
                                    sympathetic interest shown by the United States Government in
                                    all that affects the welfare of the Liberian Republic, feel it
                                    is due to both Governments that the point of view of Liberia be
                                    always frankly explained to the Department of State. The
                                    Liberian Government’s point of view on certain provisions of the
                                    Firestone agreements which are open to objection on grounds of
                                    [apparent omission], was covered fully in their opinion in

                                    telegram to the American Minister at Monrovia. These cause the
                                    most serious objections to proposed loan.</p>
                                <p>The basic position taken by the Liberian Government on this
                                    question is that it is not politically advisable in their
                                    opinion to place the Republic of Liberia under financial
                                    obligations to private interests operating in Liberia under
                                    grants from the Liberian Government.</p>
                                <p>This is a policy which seems vital to the future of the Republic
                                    and which the Liberian Government could be with difficulty
                                    persuaded to change.</p>
                                <p>Secondly, the Government feels and always has felt that no loan
                                    should be arranged with private interests under the terms and
                                    conditions negotiated by the Liberian mission to the United
                                    States in 1921. Any rights which the Liberian Government for
                                    political reasons would willingly accord to the American
                                    Government or any obligations which they would be willing to
                                    assume <hi rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> that Government, <pb
                                        n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0513"/>they would not be
                                    willing to grant or undertake toward private interests, even
                                    though well recommended.</p>
                                <p>It is hoped that the American Department of State approves the
                                    reasons which my Government urge, that the loan question be
                                    taken up in a separate agreement, of which the conditions and
                                    terms might be arranged and that the projected loan be omitted
                                    from the present agreement in which it seems to have no logical
                                    place.</p>
                                <p>If, however, the American Government, after having accorded
                                    sympathetic consideration to the above-stated views considers it
                                    advisable that the loan be obtained through the agency of Mr.
                                    Firestone, the Liberian Government at the proper time would be
                                    willing to supply him with the powers necessary to authorize him
                                    to commence preliminary negotiations for the loan and would
                                    assemble the Legislature with the object of considering the
                                    contracts. Edwin Barclay.”</p>

                        <p>14. The Government of Liberia requests that I transmit this additional
                            explanation, which embodies its interpretation of the Firestone
                            agreements. The main points of this addendum are as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Liberian Government affirms that a loan is to be raised in
                                    the United States, but one not following all the terms and
                                    conditions of the 1921 plan. The Government would assign the
                                    revenues of the Republic as security and would authorize the
                                    appointment of officers to administer and supervise the revenues
                                    in such manner as may be agreed upon in the negotiation of the
                                    loan, provided these officers are nominated by the American
                                    Government. If it be found impossible finally to arrange the
                                    loan, Liberia is not to be held responsible for reimbursing
                                    Firestone for money invested in Liberia, and the agreements
                                    would be effective and valid only when ratified by the Liberian
                                    Legislature. This ratification would carry with it automatically
                                    authority for the Government to secure the contract and enter
                                    into a loan agreement.</p>
                                <p>In Agreement 2, article 2, paragraph (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>),

                                    free under the existing tariff.” In Agreement 2, article 3,

                        <p>10. Your 13, May 13, 2 p.m. You may transmit the following to the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Department of State has received the message of the Liberian
                                    Government as transmitted in the telegram of May 13 from the
                                    American Legation and has carefully considered the statements
                                    made relative to the loan clause as it now stands in the
                                    Firestone contracts.</p>
                                <p>As already stated by Mr. Firestone, the reference to the 1921
                                    loan plan was intended merely as a basis for subsequent
                                    negotiation, any objectionable or uneconomic features to be
                                    eliminated at the time of negotiation. He has reiterated to the
                                    Department that there is no intention to bind Liberia in the
                                    express terms of the 1921 plan.</p>
                                <p>The Department appreciates the reluctance of the Liberian
                                    Government to assume obligations toward private interests
                                    operating in Liberia identical with those which it might
                                    willingly assume toward the American Government. Mr. Firestone
                                    assures the Department that the company advancing the money for
                                    a loan will be separate from the corporation which will be
                                    formed to promote rubber development in Liberia. Obviously,
                                    however, it would be impossible to raise any loan in the United
                                    States on security which could be offered by Liberia unless
                                    there is to be the extensive development contemplated in the
                                    Firestone contracts. This is proved by the fact that the recent
                                    attempt to raise $25,000 on unused bonds of the Liberian
                                    Government was unsuccessful. It is also clear that American
                                    bankers would insist on some supervision of the finances and to
                                    meet this necessity the Department has already stated that it
                                    would, at the request of the Liberian Government and American
                                    interests advancing the loan, assist in the selection of a
                                    general receiver. It would appear to this Government that these
                                    provisions would thoroughly safeguard Liberian interests.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Firestone, it is understood, has already indicated his
                                    willingness to accept, if the Liberian Government prefers, a
                                    straight 99-year lease instead of the 50-year lease with the
                                    possibility of amendment by arbitration thereafter and this,
                                    together with his statements as to the loan, would appear to the
                                    Department to meet the wishes of the Liberian Government.</p>
                                <p>I can only remind you finally of the traditional policy of good
                                    will and sympathetic interest which has guided the relations of
                                    this Government toward Liberia and assure you that you may rely
                                    on a continuation of this policy in the era of prosperity which,
                                    it is believed, will follow the consummation of the Firestone
                                    contracts. Frank B. Kellogg.”</p>

                            to Washington was the discussion with the commissioner of rubber

                            have the honour to say that the Liberian Government appreciating the
                            goodwill and sympathetic interest so continuously manifested in the
                            affairs of the Republic by the Government of the United States accept
                            with satisfaction the assurances given in said telegram, and will be
                            disposed to enter into agreements with Mr. Firestone on the
                            understanding, so far as these agreements suggest the flotation of a
                            loan for development purposes in Liberia, that the detailed terms of the
                            loan agreement will be worked out in subsequent negotiations <pb n="434"
                                xml:id="pg_434" facs="0516"/>and that the money will not be advanced
                            by Mr. Firestone or the Corporation which he might form to promote
                            rubber development in Liberia.</p>
                        <p>I have to point out that any hesitancy which the Liberian Government may
                            have shown in relation to this matter grew out of an attitude of the
                            public mind which was largely antagonistic to the question of a loan.
                            This public feeling was aroused both by the terms of the Agreement of
                            1921, and by the manner in which those proposals were turned down by the
                            United States Senate. This situation necessitated and still necessitates
                            a considerable amount of suggestive propaganda by the Government before
                            public opinion can be brought back to a favourable and receptive
                            attitude towards this question.</p>
                        <p>I desire to emphasize the point that my Government have fully understood
                            that the Bankers who might advance money to the Government of Liberia
                            would insist upon some supervision of the Liberian finances by officials
                            nominated for that purpose. The number of such officials, their pay,
                            functions, powers and obligations must of course be worked out in the
                            detailed terms, and they must be nominated by the United States
                            Department of State.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the life of the Firestone contracts I desire to make
                            clear, that my Government raise no objections to the two fifty-year
                            periods which are proposed as the term of the Firestone interests. But
                            they feel that they must oppose objections to the provision which,
                            looking forward to a revision of the scale of payments which Firestone
                            will make to the Government, would adjust this question by arbitration
                            and thus open the way for controversies which my Government are most
                            anxious by all possible means to avoid. It would seem to my Government
                            preferable that the basis of those payments should remain the same
                            during the period for which the contract must run, whether the life of
                            the lease be a straight ninety-nine year term or two terms of fifty
                            years each. These views together with those expressed in the addendum
                            which has already been communicated to Mr. Firestone’s representative
                            here, a copy of which was also filed in your Legation,<note n="39"

                            memorandum on the subject transmitted in November 1924 through the
                            Financial Adviser.<note n="40" xml:id="d361fn40">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>In reply to the questionnaire section of your despatch, I am instructed
                            by the President to point out that the public pronouncement of the
                            Liberian Executive up until November 1924, in no way indicated the
                            “earnest desire” of Liberia for a loan. The failure of the 1921
                            Agreement to materialize made the Liberian people clearly see that they
                            need not seek or expect from America or elsewhere financial assistance
                            of the kind then contemplated. They felt themselves thrown back upon
                            their own unaided resources. In his letter to Mr. Dearing, to which
                            reference is made in your despatch, the President observed in substance
                            that notwithstanding the failure of the 1921 proposals, Liberia’s desire
                            for the rehabilitation of her finances was just as keen as it had been
                            before that failure, but he suggested that this rehabilitation, he had
                            come to see, should be along the line of internal economic development
                            rather than foreign financial assistance in the form of loans. The
                            President, therefore, enquired whether or not Mr. Dearing thought it
                            possible “to get some reliable and honest financial group with the ‘OK’
                            of your State Department interested in the economic development of
                            Liberia?” This enquiry was indicative of the trend of policy which the
                            President then felt himself compelled, by reason of the American refusal
                            of assistance, thereafter to follow. That policy was financial
                            rehabilitation through foreign investment for the development of
                            economic resources.</p>
                        <p>The President emphasized this point of view in his inaugural address of
                            January 1924, when he said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“<hi rend="italic">Foreign Loans</hi>. Past
                                    experience whispers to our ears a cautious tread along these
                                    lines. Foreign loans carry with them too many political
                                    entanglements.</p>
                                <p>We should bend all energies to the building up of such a healthy
                                    revenue that will assure to us financial stability and
                                    international credit on an equitable basis. In the meantime the
                                    economic development of the country should be left to private
                                    foreign enterprise under safe and reasonable terms of
                                    operation.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The expression of these views in such circumstances and the programme of
                            Legislation thereafter initiated and put in force, seem to the President
                            an effective public notification to every interest concerned in Liberia
                            of the Administration’s objectives and the means by which they were
                            hoped to be attained. Any representations made <pb n="436"
                                xml:id="pg_436" facs="0518"/>to your Government contrary to these
                            indications could not have correctly represented the desires of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>When the Firestone proposals were first submitted with the tacit approval
                            of your Department of State the President was impressed that his views
                            were thoroughly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>These agreements constituted a complete scheme of economic development
                            along a particular line, without the imposition of any extraordinary
                            financial burdens upon the Republic, and yet having inherent in it the
                            possibility of financial rehabilitation through the indirect results of
                            the operations thereunder. Being thus in accord with Government policy
                            already announced they were endorsed and supported in the fact [<hi
                                rend="italic">face?</hi>] of strong public opposition as the means
                            by which your Government’s benevolent interest in this Republic had
                            found practical expression, without involving Liberia in the political
                            entanglements which would necessarily and inevitably have followed a
                            loan.</p>
                        <p>Although the programme of development initiated by the Government
                            produced gratifying results, these results were not commensurate with
                            the Government’s hopes and desires. They were advised that completely
                            satisfactory results could only be achieved by the expenditure of larger
                            sums than would be available for any expansion in revenues which could
                            reasonably be immediately expected. As a means of exploring the
                            possibility of procuring such support, if necessary, the suggestion of
                            November 1924, transmitted through the Financial Adviser, was thrown
                            out. The Government of Liberia have never been advised whether the
                            Department of State thought the scheme practicable, or that the money
                            could be secured. The President was left to follow the course upon which
                            he had embarked convinced that in this, as in the scheme of 1921, he had
                            mistaken the kind of assistance which could be reasonably expected and
                            secured in America.</p>
                        <p>All this must be envisaged as the back-ground of the discussions had upon
                            the recent Firestone proposals, which, without notice to the Liberian
                            Government, attached to the Agreement for economic exploitation by
                            private means, a suggestion for the flotation of a public loan which was
                            represented as an indispensable prerequisite to the plantation
                            operations. Such an invitation to depart from a policy already settled
                            upon by the Government and supported by public opinion could not be
                            accepted without examination and without the assurance from your
                            Government which were sought and which the telegram of Mr. Kellogg
                            explicitly gives.</p>

                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Mr. William D. Hines, Mr. Harvey S. Firestone’s personal
                                    representative, asked that the Agreements be signed as he had
                                    brought them over without any farther negotiations or changes.
                                    To this the Liberian Government positively objected for the
                                    following reasons:</item>

                                <item>Because the draft brought back by Mr. Hines contained things
                                    which were not in the draft approved by the Liberian Legislature
                                    which had been taken by him to the United States for Mr.

                                <item>Because clause (K) of Agreement No. 2 said the Firestone Loan
                                    should be upon the same terms and conditions as the Loan of
                                    1921, some features of which had always been objectionable: <list>

                                        <item>Notwithstanding this on account of the need of money
                                            and moral support from the United States, the Liberian
                                            Legislature unanimously endorsed it and the public
                                            looked forward hopefully to the beneficial results that
                                            would come from it.</item>

                                        <item>The failure of the loan was a great disappointment and
                                            left the country in a most embarrassing

                                        <item>The matter afterward became the storm centre of the
                                            Liberian Presidential Campaign of 1923. All this has
                                            left the public mind here in an irritated, unpleasant
                                            state relative to the Loan of 1921.</item>

                                <item>So true is this that even when the signing of the Agreements
                                    was urged with the statement of Mr. Firestone’s willingness to
                                    make whatever changes or modifications might be necessary after
                                    the signing, the Liberian Government felt a kind of apprehension
                                    about doing so while the expression remained embodied therein
                                    holding them to the same terms and conditions of the 1921
                                    Loan.</item>

                                <item>The main objection to the Agreements, however, is that the
                                    Loan and Rubber Contracts are tied up together. The objection is
                                    that the Liberian Government does not wish to be obligated by a
                                    loan from any firm doing business in the country. <list>

                                        <item>It does want it very clearly understood that it is not
                                            for any want of confidence in, or any fear of, the
                                            Firestone Company, especially so long as Mr. Firestone
                                            himself is the head of the firm. It is, however, they
                                            allege, because no one can tell what changes in the
                                            personnel of the Firestone Company might take place and
                                            the Liberian Government might have to deal with a very
                                            different condition of things than now exists in the
                                            Firestone Company. Whatever the contractual stipulations
                                            were they might find themselves greatly embarrassed in
                                            the event of a change.</item>

                                        <item>A second reason, is, a precedent is given that might
                                            weaken the Liberian Government’s position in dealing
                                            with some other nationality upon the same question when
                                            it was attempting to defend a principle it had announced
                                            as a settled policy of not putting itself under

                            maintains its position which is set forth in its dispatch to this
                            Legation No. 432/D, a copy of which is enclosed, dated April 28,
                                1925,<note n="42" xml:id="d363fn42"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>,

                        <p>There then began a series of conversations between Mr. Hines, the
                            Financial Adviser and the Liberian Government during which numerous
                            propositions were drafted and again and again revised in the attempt to
                            find a basis agreeable to both parties, during which time the Liberian
                            Government became apprehensive that the delay in signing the Agreements
                            might appear as if it did not appreciate the goodly [<hi rend="italic"
                                >sic</hi>] offices of the Department and consequently sent, through
                            this Legation, the message contained in cablegram No. 13, dated May 13,
                            1925, to fully explain its position and requested an expression from the
                            State Department. A common basis of agreement seemed to have been found
                            in an addendum which, with a copy of despatch No. 488/D, dated May 18,
                            1925, is herewith transmitted.<note n="44" xml:id="d363fn44">Neither
                                printed; for substance of the addendum, see telegram No. 14, May 22,

                        <p>It was thought the matter had been virtually solved until in a
                            conversation about it with one of the Cabinet officials, a construction
                            was placed on statement (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), paragraph 7, page 3,
                            which construction made the whole addendum particularly objectionable to
                            the representative of Mr. Firestone. The following is the statement:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) The Agreements and this addendum

                                    that this ratification automatically carries with it authority
                                    for the Executive Branch of the Liberian Government to contract
                                    for and enter into a loan on the aforementioned basis”.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This statement had been interpreted to mean that after
                            the ratification, by the Liberian Legislature, of the agreements with
                            the addendum, the President would have the right automatically to go
                            forward and contract for, and enter into, a loan without any farther
                            reference to the Legislature for further ratification. The President,
                            however when asked, said this was not so but that after he had entered
                            into and contracted for a loan upon the basis stated in paragraph 7—(<hi

                            must go back to the Legislature for its ratification.</p>
                        <p>This attitude greatly perturbed Mr. Firestone’s representative who, after
                            cabling Mr. Firestone and receiving instructions, withdrew the
                            agreements, hence breaking off negotiations and left for the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>At this time the last cablegram from the Department No. 10 and dated May
                            22, 1925, had been received and transmitted by this Legation to the
                            Liberian Government, but no reply had been received <pb n="441"
                                xml:id="pg_441" facs="0523"/>until after Mr. Hines’ departure.
                            During the negotiations and discussions that had gone on between the
                            President and Secretary of State, Mr. Hines and this Legation and from
                            authentic reports of some remarks made during Liberian Cabinet meetings,
                            it seemed possible that the Department of State and this Legation might
                            appear to be forcing something upon Liberia or making some special
                            effort in the interest of a particular American firm. In order,
                            therefore, that such a reply upon the whole situation might be elicited
                            from the Government of Liberia as would leave no misapprehensions or
                            misunderstandings, the following questions were asked: <list>

                        <p>20. For Castle. Telegram has been received by De la Rue from National
                            City Bank stating that Firestone insists that an official commission be
                            sent to America with full authority to definitely close the loan. The
                            suggestion of the Liberian Government is to send the Secretary of State
                            at once to arrange the loan and to summon the Legislature immediately
                            after his return here to ratify. Impossible to comply with Firestone’s
                            suggestion that the commission accept finally. The plan of the
                            Government is much better, and is the speediest legal method. Acceptance
                            by the Secretary of State assures ratification by the Legislature.</p>

                        <p>Have cable from Ross. Liberian Government suggested modifications in
                            Agreements.</p>
                        <p>With exception of food clause consider modifications only technical
                            wording and would not change actual carrying out of Agreements.</p>
                        <p>Confidence and honesty of purpose is basis of any agreement to succeed.
                            If this is not mutual no wording in agreements will help. I have given
                            Liberia my full confidence and hope you will reciprocate not only for
                            myself but for America. You never had such fine opportunity to cement
                            more closely this mutual confidence.</p>
                        <p>Consider Liberia’s interest best served by not taxing food for revenue
                            and therefore not willing change food clause.</p>

                        <p>12. Referring to your 20, June 11, 5 p.m. Firestone has directed Ross to
                            change the loan clause to conform to “Liberian legal requirements,” so
                            providing for eventual ratification by the Legislature following the
                            negotiation of the loan agreement in the United States. It is hoped that
                            this arrangement will remove any remaining objections of the Liberian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The plan will be therefore (1) immediate signature of the agreements as
                            modified; (2) the extension of an invitation by Firestone through the
                            Department of State for a commission to come to America; (3) the
                            dispatch of the commission and negotiation of the loan agreement; (4)
                            the ratification of the loan agreement by the Legislature of
                            Liberia.</p>
                        <p>With reference to (4), it is Firestone’s hope that Legislature can be
                            summoned in special session while the commission is still in the United
                            States and that the Legislature will ratify on basis of terms
                            telegraphed to the Liberian Government.</p>
                        <p>Firestone insists on signature of agreements as modified prior to visit
                            of commission and as preliminary to further negotiations.</p>

                        <p>13. The Department understands, in view of recent developments, that the
                            ideas of the Liberian Government and of Firestone are finally in
                            agreement and that the signature of the agreements as modified is to be
                            expected at any moment.</p>
                        <p>The Department is glad, in view of its traditional policy of maintaining
                            a friendly interest toward Liberia, to forward, at the wish of the
                            interested parties, an invitation to the Government of Liberia to send a
                            commission to the United States to arrange a bankers’ loan. <pb n="444"
                                xml:id="pg_444" facs="0526"/>The Department would be pleased to
                            furnish appropriate assistance and advice to the Government of Liberia
                            in this connection.</p>
                        <p>The Department feels that the Financial Adviser, on account of his
                            thorough acquaintance with Liberian financial conditions, should either
                            travel to this country with the commission or follow it as soon as
                            practicable. In all likelihood Bussell<note n="47" xml:id="d367fn47">C.

                                    rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> Firestone once more has sent to
                            the Liberian Government an open cablegram with regard to the loan
                            agreement and the foggy [<hi rend="italic">food</hi>] clause. The
                            Liberian Government is much annoyed because of this method of
                            communication, which informs foreign representatives about its intended
                            action. It was intended to complete negotiations and bring them before
                            the Legislature before adverse propaganda could be started.</p>
                        <p>Minor details in the agreements had not been thought here to materially
                            affect Firestone, although important matters for Liberia. They are as
                            follows: (1) The transportation and communication rights included to be
                            only private and not to constitute a public utility monopoly; (2) the
                            corporation is to be formed under the laws of the United States; (3) any
                            exemption of foodstuffs from duties are not to be applied as soon as the
                            loan is negotiated, as is now specified, but only gradually as financial
                            circumstances of the Government permit; (4) the collection of taxes on
                            employees may be arranged if the company wishes, whereas the agreements
                            at present imply that taxes have been collected illegally in the past;
                            (5) the public works included in Agreement 3 are to be built through the
                            loan, and this agreement is unnecessary when the loan is negotiated.</p>
                        <p>The opinion of Ross as cabled to Firestone approves these modifications.
                            Advise Firestone to empower Ross to sign agreement, whereupon De la Rue
                            and the commission, as suggested, will come to America.</p>

                        <p>22. Firestone in cable to Ross ordered agreements resubmitted, but
                            refused to accept alterations suggested in Legation’s 21, June 14. Ross
                            at my advice takes no action pending reply from Legation’s 21, as
                            refusal to consider suggested modifications would assuredly be answered
                            by refusal to sign. I advise strongly that Firestone be told that
                            modifications do not affect his interests adversely and are not mere
                            technical quibbles, but some are of such importance to the Government of
                            Liberia as to affect international relations. Action immediately most
                            important.</p>

                        <p>14. The Department has learned that Firestone authorized Ross by cable
                            June 18 to agree to the desires of the Liberian Government regarding all
                            modifications mentioned in your 21, June 14, 2 a.m. Accordingly the
                            Department assumes that the agreements will be signed at once and that
                            the commission will soon proceed to America. Advise probable makeup of
                            commission and date of arrival in order that formal invitation from
                            Firestone may be suitably extended.</p>
                        <p>Bussell is preparing to return and will leave when the Department is
                            informed that the agreements have been signed.</p>

                        <p>15. The Department has learned with surprise that its 14 June 20, noon,
                            has been construed as meaning that Ross had been instructed to accept
                            all modifications which might be requested by the Liberian Government.
                            This is a grave misunderstanding as Firestone’s instruction to Ross of
                            June 18 and the Dept’s 14, June 20 noon covered only the five specific
                            points reported in your 21 June 14, 2 a.m., and did not constitute a
                            blanket acceptance of any further modifications which the Liberian
                            Government might propose.</p>
                        <p>The action of the Liberian Government in proposing further modifications
                            at a moment when it was believed that a complete accord had been reached
                            has had the effect of causing Mr. Firestone to question the utility of
                            continuing negotiations with the Liberian Government and has brought
                            about a state of affairs in which complete and final withdrawal by
                            Firestone is a serious and imminent possibility. Mr. Firestone has
                            stated to the Department that he is not disposed to consider further
                            modifications and has declared that further delays of this nature will
                            compel him to give serious consideration to the advisability of
                            transferring his interests from Liberia to the other fields indicated in
                            the final paragraph of the Department’s 10, May 22, 1 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Believing that the Firestone project offers a unique opportunity for
                            Liberian rehabilitation and prosperity, the Department can only view the
                            possibility of Firestone’s withdrawal with the greatest regret, and it
                            is confident that the Liberian Government will realize the gravity and
                            urgency of the situation.</p>

                        <p>You will employ your best efforts to remove all possible misunderstanding
                            as to the meaning of the Department’s 14, June 20, noon, and to
                            facilitate a prompt conclusion of the negotiations. To this end you may
                            show and read this telegram to the Liberian authorities. Do not give a
                            copy to the Minister.</p>

                        <p>19. Please hand to President King the following personal message from Mr.
                            Firestone: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In view of present advantageous conditions for raising capital
                                    for rubber cultivation, it is imperative that formal

                        <p>29. Department’s telegram 19, July 15, 6 p.m. President King feels that
                            he must have Secretary Barclay’s report and the actual signed documents
                            in his hands before issuing the call for a special session of the
                            Legislature. There has been a certain amount of adverse propaganda and
                            President King desires to be in a position to support all the loan terms
                            unequivocally and to stand solidly for immediate ratification. Upon
                            receipt of the above information he will call a special session, no
                            matter how near the date of the regular session may be.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Castle</hi>: The results of Saturday’s
                            conferences and one held today with Mr. Firestone, Col. Crews<note
                                n="52" xml:id="d377fn52">Col. Ralph Crews, member of law firm of
                                Shearman &amp; Sterling.</note> and Mr. Firestone, Jr., have so far
                            shown no difficulty as to the terms of control of finances or the
                            general plan of the Loan. The Bank’s tendency at present is to recommend
                            that a loan be entered into for $5,000,000. and bonds will be authorized
                            for that amount. It is suggested, however, that only $2,500,000. be
                            actually issued and that this be spread over a period of two years
                            because it is felt that no more than this will be needed during 1926 and
                            1927 and that it is more than probable this amount will carry on the
                            public works contemplated through 1928. This is especially true because
                            the idea is to make the charges for sinking fund and interest payments
                            as small as possible. For instance we are now discussing making no
                            payments for sinking fund for the first five years and paying interest
                            only on the bonds which are actually issued. This plan will reserve to
                            the use of Liberia a larger proportion of the revenues and in this way
                            we augment our available funds to a very great extent so that it will be
                            unnecessary to use up the credit established by the bond issue as
                            rapidly as would otherwise be expected.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty seems to be this. If the City Company contracts to furnish
                            $5,000,000. over a period let us say of six years, we will have <pb
                                n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0531"/>to pay a higher rate because of
                            the various contingencies that must be taken into consideration by the
                            Bank in guaranteeing these payments for a future period. If, on the
                            other hand, we do not need $5,000,000. in the next two or three years
                            but only need $2,500,000 then we can get $2,500,000 for very much less
                            proportionately than if we had to pay on $5,000,000. over six years and
                            only use $2,500,000. in the first three. The advantage therefore appears
                            to be with the Liberian Government in accepting a contract to advance
                            $2,500,000. against bonds in this manner and leaving the issuance of the
                            balance of the bond issue an open matter for discussion two or three
                            years from now.</p>
                        <p>The disadvantage is of course that two and a half or three years from now
                            should we desire to issue the $2,500,000. remaining of the bond issue or
                            any portion thereof it is possible that the City Company would refuse to
                            handle these bonds or that by reason of world money conditions or wars,
                            etc., other companies would likewise refuse to handle the balance of the
                            bond issue. This would place the government in a position such as it
                            found itself in a few months ago when it tried to issue the balance of
                            the bonds of the 1912 Loan which had been reserved for public works and
                            found itself unable to place these bonds.</p>
                        <p>My personal thought is that with the Firestone development proceeding in
                            an orderly way and with various public works more or less completed the
                            capital value of the bonds would be so strong as to destroy the
                            disadvantages mentioned, subject, of course, to unexpected contingencies
                            such as war, financial depression, etc.</p>
                        <p>I consider that the Firestone Company would, moreover, be so interested
                            in the issuance of these bonds if further public works finances were
                            needed that we would have a strong ally in securing a market, and that
                            it would be to our advantage to take this risk.</p>
                        <p>I hope I have made the situation quite clear and that you will find an
                            opportunity to give the matter some thought because it is a very serious
                            decision to make and I confess I would be most grateful for the benefit
                            of your personal opinion. As you will have seen Mr. Barclay today it is
                            unnecessary for me to comment upon his personal attitude other than to
                            remark that in his private conversations with me he is deeply grateful
                            for the courtesy that is being shown him and fully appreciates its
                            significance. Granted that no unfortunate misunderstanding or difficulty
                            takes place, I believe the attitude of the whole Liberian people toward
                            the investment of American capital and toward the interest of the United
                            States in their country will be strongly influenced by the reaction of
                            Mr. Barclay to his treatment here.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully and sincerely yours,</p>

                            Treasury shall prepare an itemized budget for the ensuing year, which
                            shall contain statements in detail of the probable revenues and receipts
                            of the Government for the ensuing fiscal year from all sources, and of
                            all proposed expenditures chargeable in any manner against such revenues
                            and receipts. This proposed budget shall be prepared in consultation
                            with the Financial Adviser, whose duty it shall be to assure that the
                            amounts provided to be appropriated for expenditure shall not exceed the
                            resources of the Government, as shown by careful examination and
                            comparison of the revenue estimates, and who shall further examine the

                            been properly included in the proposed statement of expenditures. In the

                            prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury of Liberia, the budget of the
                            previous year shall be operative in so far as it applies to the ordinary

                            budget, the Secretary of the Treasury of Liberia shall deliver to the
                            Financial Adviser a copy thereof as enacted and a statement of all
                            appropriations, regular and special, which shall have been made. All <pb

                            Majesty’s Government to the effect that negotiations have been
                            undertaken, or are in contemplation, between certain industrial or
                            financial groups in the United States and the government of the Republic
                            of Liberia in regard to the granting to the latter of a loan one of the
                            conditions of which would be, it is understood, that a nominee of the
                            United States should be placed in sole control of the Liberian customs.
                            In this relation I am directed to draw your attention to a note
                            addressed on the 13th September, 1919, by the late Lord Curzon, to Mr.
                            John W. Davis, then United States Ambassador in London,<note n="54"

                            His Majesty’s Government agreed to the withdrawal of the British
                            Receiver of Liberian Customs. In the following passages of that note the
                            attitude of His Majesty’s Government was indicated:— <quote

                                    <item>“1. According to a system now in force in the Liberian
                                        customs administration permits to exceed in certain respects
                                        the strict letter of the customs regulations have hitherto
                                        been granted by the authorities equally to reputable traders
                                        of all nationalities when prompt handling of merchandise
                                        would be thereby facilitated. The necessity <pb n="485"
                                            xml:id="pg_485" facs="0567"/>for such a system is
                                        occasioned, it is understood, largely, if not entirely, by
                                        the absence in Liberia of “bonded warehouses”, properly
                                        so-called. His Majesty’s Government, then rely upon the
                                        continued observance under the new administration of strict
                                        impartiality in the issue of such permits to British
                                        traders.</item>
                                    <item>2. His Majesty’s Government are confident that the customs
                                        dues on all imports of British goods, as well as on exports
                                        of Liberian produce of all descriptions without exception,
                                        to any part of the British Empire, will be levied at no
                                        higher rates than, and in an exactly similar manner as, on
                                        imports of United States merchandise into Liberia, and
                                        exports of produce from Liberia to the United States of
                                        America.</item>
                                    <item>3. It is assumed that the United States Government in the
                                        special position which they are in future to occupy in
                                        Liberia, will support any representations which His
                                        Majesty’s Government might at any time be called upon to
                                        make to the Liberian Government, should the latter take any
                                        action to cancel, limit, or infringe the rights possessed by
                                        British subjects by virtue of the existing concessions in
                                        the country.”</item>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>His Majesty’s Government now desire me to say that so long as they
                            refrain from exercising their right of appointing a British Receiver of
                            Liberian customs, they naturally expect that the stipulations above
                            quoted will remain in force and they are confident that equality of
                            treatment for all nationalities will be maintained in Liberia.</p>

                        <p>398. The Department of State is informed that Mr. Barclay, Secretary of
                            State of Liberia, at present in Paris,<note n="55" xml:id="d385fn55">In
                                connection with the Franco-Liberian boundary dispute, see <ref
                                    target="#pg_495">pp. 495</ref> ff.</note> is expecting direct
                            word from this Department containing approval of the tentative <pb
                                n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0568"/>loan terms negotiated recently
                            by him with American banking interests.</p>
                        <p>This is caused, the Department is informed, by a misunderstanding of the
                            practice of the Department in such matters on the part of the General
                            Receiver of Customs of Liberia, De la Rue. Please let Barclay know that
                            it is necessary to follow the usual procedure with regard to the
                            flotation of foreign loans, according to the outline in the Department’s
                            statement of March 3, 1922,<note n="56" xml:id="d385fn56"><ref
                                    target="frus1922v01#pg_557"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                    557</ref>.</note> of which a copy was included with circular
                            instruction in May 1922, and that the representative of the bankers has
                            been informed accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The tentative terms of the loan have already been submitted informally to
                            the Department by the bankers.</p>
                        <p>It is the intention of the Department to advise the bankers informally of
                            its views at an early date. It assumes that any modifications in the
                            agreements, which the bankers may then think wise will be made a matter
                            of direct negotiations between the bankers and the Government of
                            Liberia.</p>
                        <p>When the final terms of the loan are submitted to the Department, it will
                            then indicate to the bankers whether or not it finds any basis for
                            objection, in accordance with the principles of the statement of March
                            3, 1922.</p>
                        <p>If and when any of the terms of the final loan agreement calling for the
                            nomination of a financial adviser or any other action by the American
                            Government, are to be brought into operation, the Liberian Government
                            will then, it is understood, request officially the good offices of the
                            American Government in the matter.</p>
                        <p>When outlining this course to Mr. Barclay, you should make it plain that
                            the procedure accords with the well-defined policy of the Department
                            with regard to the flotation of foreign loans in this country and that
                            it represents no change whatever in the attitude of the American
                            Government toward Liberia, the Firestone project, or the loan
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>If Barclay desires for his guidance a memorandum containing the substance
                            of this telegram, you may supply it to him.</p>

                            of the three agreements relating to your enterprise in Liberia which you
                            were good enough to forward to Mr. Carter of this Department. In this
                            connection, <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0569"/>I desire to refer
                            to conversations which you and your representatives had with officials
                            of this Department last December with reference to the term of the
                                concession.<note n="57" xml:id="d386fn57">See memoranda of Dec. 12,

                                    >387</ref>.</note> At that time it was pointed out to you and
                            your associates that it appeared advisable either that the term of the
                            concession be shortened from ninety-nine years or that some provision be
                            made for revision of the fiscal relations between the Company and the
                            Government in case the longer term were retained. With respect to the
                            question of adjusting fiscal arrangements, mention was made of the
                            possibility of some form of arbitration.</p>
                        <p>The Department has noted that the text of the agreement recently
                            forwarded to the Department provides for a term of ninety-nine years
                            without provision for review of its terms prior to the end of the
                            period. With reference to this matter, I desire to refer to your
                            telegram of April 28, 1925, to Mr. Castle<note n="58" xml:id="d386fn58"

                            to the terms of the arrangement. It appears from these documents that
                            you took up with the Liberian Government the matter of the term of the
                            lease, but that the Government raised objection to an arrangement along
                            the lines indicated in the preceding paragraph. This Department will be
                            glad to receive such further information as you can give on this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>I beg to refer also to provision in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>)
                            of Article IV of “Agreement No. 2” to the effect that the lessee shall
                            endeavor to procure a loan “either from the Government of the United
                            States or with the approval of the Secretary of State of the United
                            States from, some other person or persons”. In this connection I desire
                            to call attention to the next to the last paragraph of Mr. Hughes’
                            letter to you dated December 22, 1924, and also to the enclosed copy of

                        <p>534. Your 398 of October 28th. The Liberian Secretary of State, Barclay,
                            informs me that he understands fully the policy of the Department
                            regarding the notation of foreign loans in the United States, and that
                            he does not expect to receive from the Department a memorial opinion on
                            the tentative loan terms, which he describes as being in an “academic
                            stage” as far as his Government is concerned. For his further guidance
                            the substance of your 398, dated October 28th, was conveyed to him by
                            memorandum.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Harrison</hi>: The pressure of business
                            connected with the close of our fiscal year has prevented me from
                            answering your letter of October 31st, and I trust you will pardon the
                            delay.</p>
                        <p>We originally prepared our proposal to cover a term of ninety-nine years
                            at a certain rental. It was the suggestion of your Department that a
                            shorter term subject to renewal and revision of rates, might be more
                            equitable. We changed our proposed contract to conform to this opinion,
                            and in the form taken to Liberia by our Mr. Hines and there presented to
                            the Liberian Government it called for a term of fifty years subject to
                            renewal, revision of rates and arbitration thereof in the event of
                            dispute. Many weeks were there taken up in negotiations. The Liberian
                            Government rejected the shorter term provisions, and put back in the
                            provision that the contract be for the long term with fixed rental not
                            subject to revision, as it is now written. The contract being otherwise
                            satisfactory to us, we had no alternative except to submit.</p>
                        <p>With reference to loan provisions, they appear in the final executed
                            contracts on account of the desire of the Liberian Government to have
                            our assistance and the State Department’s advice in securing whatever
                            loan they might be able to obtain in this country—it being, of course,
                            understood that such would not be available to them if not consistent
                            with the policy of our State Department.</p>

                            reaction in Liberia. I assure you this is only newspaper story. Actual
                            facts are we will not send one hundred Americans or Europeans to Liberia
                            in 1926 and at no time could we possibly use over one thousand or
                            fifteen hundred for entire development. My regards to yourself Secretary

                            the following report in confirmation of cablegram number 43 dated
                            December 28th, 1925.<note n="62" xml:id="d390fn62">Not

                        <p>On Wednesday the 16th of December, His Excellency President King,
                            delivered his annual message to the National Legislature. Copies of this
                            message will be transmitted to the Department when available. The
                            message was well received except general criticism because nothing was
                            stated either with reference to the Firestone concession, the loan, or
                            the mission of the Liberian Secretary of State, Hon. Edwin Barclay, to
                            the United States and France. This omission proved shrewd political
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>Later, however, at a private meeting all agreements were read to the
                            National Legislature, cabinet, and elder statesmen, (ex-president Arthur
                            Barclay, ex-president D. E. Howard, etc.)</p>
                        <p>This Legation is well informed that at this meeting President King spoke
                            very favorably towards the United States and Secretary <pb n="490"
                                xml:id="pg_490" facs="0572"/>Barclay’s report. Those present were
                            permitted to discuss at length all agreements. …</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The apprehension relative to the large number of American employees to
                            enter Liberia is entirely over for a cable from Mr. Firestone denying
                            the report that 30,000 men were to be used, was read at this meeting.
                            Further, upon considering the millions of dollars necessary for such a
                            staff of men, the utter impossibility of this propaganda was self
                            evident.</p>
                        <p>This Legation has little doubt concerning the outcome of the Loan
                            agreement with the Finance Corporation of America, nevertheless, the
                            points raised will make it necessary for an extension, for it is
                            impossible for this agreement to be submitted to the Legislature and
                            negotiations concluded by January 1st, the expiration date of the said
                            corporation’s offer. There is a general feeling that should the time be
                            extended the agreements will be modified and ratified before the end of
                            January 1926.</p>
                        <p>Many points have been raised and contrary views expressed relative to the
                            loan agreement, especially with reference to powers of the Financial
                            Adviser, number and salaries of officials provided, and the pledging of
                            all revenues of the country. However, this Legation is enclosing the
                            present proposed amendments of the President which he hopes will so

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report, for
                                transmission to the Department that the Agreement with the Firestone
                                and incidentally, the Agreement with the National City Bank of New
                                York have been before the Liberian Legislature in joint session, and
                                have been explained to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State.</p>

                                <item>The Firestone Agreements were the first matters taken up, and
                                    with one or two small and unimportant points were generally
                                    received with satisfaction. The point that caused the most
                                    apprehension and discussion was occasioned by an American
                                    newspaper printing that 30,000 American employees would be
                                    employed here by Mr. Firestone. The representatives viewed this
                                    suggestion with considerable apprehension as it represents a
                                    larger number of persons than is contained in the
                                    Americo-Liberian population. There was a strong and decided
                                    effort to limit the number of employees from the United States
                                    which Mr. Firestone would be permitted to bring into this
                                    country. Happily I believe this matter is now settled without
                                    such legislation being deemed necessary.</item>

                                <item>Another point raised was the question of phraseology in the
                                    No. 2 Agreement (Firestone) wherein it was stated that upon Mr.
                                    Firestone selecting the land, title would pass. It was thought
                                    that this was misleading because the only estate Mr. Firestone
                                    would have would be a leasehold estate, and further, it did not
                                    specify that he was to pay rent upon taken [<hi rend="italic"
                                        >taking</hi>] possession. This point has <pb n="492"
                                        xml:id="pg_492" facs="0574"/>been covered by a letter from
                                    Mr. Ross and I believe that matter is closed also.</item>

                                <item>The question of the Agreement with the National City Bank of
                                    New York has raised a storm of discussion, but up to the present
                                    time, I have no reason to be apprehensive as to its successful
                                    passage. The delay in getting the documents to Monrovia did not
                                    permit the President and Cabinet to make any study of the
                                    various papers before the meeting of the Legislature, nor did it
                                    permit them to explain to the leaders what it was all about.
                                    This has resulted in rendering it impossible to bring the matter
                                    properly before the Legislature before January 1, 1926, which
                                    date is specified as being the date when the offer on the part
                                    of the Finance Corporation of America and the National City Bank

                                <item>Under those circumstances, the President has directed the
                                    Secretary of State to cable the National City Bank requesting

                                    of January, in which request I totally concur as I believe this
                                    will bring about a satisfactory ending to the
                                    negotiations.</item>

                                <item>In the above connection, the President has requested me to
                                    transmit, through the Legation, to the American State
                                    Department, by telegraph, my concurrence in the request for this
                                    extension of time for the reasons given above. I therefore

                                    the Liberian Government will, in my opinion, result in an
                                    entirely satisfactory ending within the next two or three
                                    weeks.</item>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: This Legation has the honor to herewith
                            submit a protest<note n="64" xml:id="d391fn64">Not printed.</note>
                            against certain alleged aggressive acts of the French Republic upon the
                            peace and territory of Liberia and requesting that the good offices of
                            the United States be exercised in procuring a peaceful adjustment of the
                            situation. This situation as set forth in this protest is sustained by
                            documentary evidence and well known facts which can be authenticated by
                            the testimony of many living witnesses, especially the American officers
                            who have in recent years and are now serving as commanders of the
                            Liberian Frontier Forces.</p>
                        <p>The whole question is daily becoming more acute and threatening to assume
                            proportions which will make future settlement more difficult.</p>
                        <p>After careful study of this whole situation during the past four years
                            there seems very little room for doubt as to what the ultimate intention
                            of the French Republic is. The history of this matter will show that
                            almost each time any question has come up for settlement, the stronger
                            power forced its will upon the weaker.</p>
                        <p>In 1885, the French Government made a claim to large parts of Liberian
                            territory. In 1892 Liberia by a forced treaty was compelled to
                            relinquish.</p>
                        <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>Difficulties again arose in 1895 resulting in a treaty in 1908 which
                            again took a large portion of Liberian territory because Liberia was
                            unable to sustain what she considered her just claim.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the enclosed protest, the French Government although having
                            had all the advantage of the former decisions, claimed the agreement of
                            1908 defective. The Liberian Government objected to the reopening of the
                            question but was compelled under French threat of forcible annexation to
                            acquiesce.</p>
                        <p>The formula for rectification was set forth in an act of 1911 and carried
                            out in 1915 when certain questions arose with regard to a town called
                            Zinta which the French demanded should [not?] be included in Liberian
                            territory upon the claim that the 11° 50′ meridian West of Paris was
                            inaccurate though the result of the findings of their own
                            Commission.</p>
                        <p>Since 1915 strenuous efforts have been made to have a final settlement
                            which have been only delayed by the French Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the long standing and continued irritation between the two
                            countries involved, and that it has each year become more acute until
                            now it reaches a threatening situation, it would therefore seem if there
                            could be an intervention by a friendly power to settle the difficulty it
                            would be eminently desirable. In this case the Liberian Government has
                            naturally turned to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Relying upon the traditional relationship and oft avowed friendly
                            interest of the American Government, especially now in the light of
                            present development, Liberia has presented this protest with the hope
                            that the United States may find some way to adjust this matter.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that an indication from the United States to France that
                            the American Government would look with disfavor upon any further
                            aggression by the French Republic and discountenance anything that
                            provoked trouble on the Franco-Liberian boundary would once for all put
                            an end to a long standing difficulty and settle a question of
                            territorial sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>In this connection it is also believed if the United States, if
                            consistent with our policy, could be accepted by both parties as an
                            arbiter and use its good offices the matter could be decided without
                            further delay.</p>

                            procuring a peaceful adjustment of the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Department has read the note of the Liberian Secretary of State and
                            your covering despatch with great interest and believes that the present
                            instance is one in which the good offices of this Government could be
                            appropriately employed to effect a peaceful and equitable settlement of
                            the boundary question.</p>
                        <p>You are therefore instructed to hand to the Liberian Secretary of State
                            the following note: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have the honor to inform you that my Government has received
                                    my despatch of July 2, 1925, transmitting your note of June 29,
                                    1925, concerning the reported aggressions of the French West
                                    African authorities upon Liberian territory, particularly in the
                                    region of Zinta (Zigida), and requesting that the good offices
                                    of the Government of the United States be employed in securing a
                                    peaceful settlement of the situation.</p>
                                <p>“I am instructed by my Government to state that your note has
                                    received its careful and sympathetic consideration, that my
                                    Government feels that the matter is one which is capable of a
                                    peaceful and amicable solution, and that it would be inclined to
                                    exercise its good offices in the effecting of such a
                                    settlement.</p>
                                <p>“Without wishing to discuss the questions involved in any detail,
                                    my Government would observe that it would appear that the
                                    principal cause of the troubles connected with the
                                    Franco-Liberian border is the failure of the Liberian and French
                                    Governments to continue and complete the work of delimiting the
                                    boundaries defined by the Franco-Liberian Treaty of September
                                    18, 1907 and the Franco-Liberian Agreement of January 13, 1911.
                                    My Government is cognizant of the difficulties which have been
                                    encountered in this connection and of the delays which have
                                    arisen, but it is of the opinion that a fresh effort should be
                                    made at this time to resume the work of joint delimitation.</p>
                                <p>“You will recall that in a note dated January 27, 1921 the
                                    Secretary of State of Liberia informed my predecessor, Mr.
                                        Johnson,<note n="65" xml:id="d392fn66">Note not
                                        printed.</note> that the French Government had declined to
                                    proceed with the program of delimitation suggested in 1919 and
                                    1920 on the ground that it was unnecessary and useless to
                                    determine any of the outstanding questions between the two
                                    governments until the purport of American plans in Liberia had
                                    been made manifest. The Secretary of State added that the
                                    Liberian Government was addressing a protest against this
                                    position of the French Government direct to Paris and that he
                                    would be grateful for American support in securing a settlement
                                    of the delimitation question.</p>

                                    upon him that the Government of the United States, in the
                                    interest of a final adjustment of the boundary question, would
                                    be glad to learn of the willingness of the French Government to
                                    resume and complete the demarkation at an early date. The
                                    Ambassador reported the result of his representations in a
                                    despatch to the Department of State, dated January 5, 1922,<note

                                    and, on the basis of this despatch, the American Minister at
                                    Monrovia was instructed by telegraph, January 31, 1922,<note

                                    to suggest to the Liberian Government that the French Government
                                    be urged through the French representative at Monrovia to
                                    appoint and send a French Boundary Commissioner immediately to
                                    join the Liberian Boundary Commissioner to complete the work of
                                    delimitation.</p>
                                <p>“At that time my Government had reason for believing that such a
                                    course would produce the desired result. However, the Liberian
                                    Government decided not to act upon this suggestion at that time
                                    and in a note, dated March 31, 1922,<note n="70"

                                    informed the American Minister that the Liberian Department of
                                    State had been advised by the Boundary Commissioner that the
                                    best interest of the Republic would not be served by urging the
                                    immediate resumption of the delimitation; the Triangulation
                                    Control which the Boundary Commissioner had been engaged in
                                    establishing had only been completed for about one-half of the
                                    length of the Franco-Liberian Frontier; that unless the whole
                                    triangulation was put in before the delimitation was resumed the
                                    Commissioner would be obliged to depend upon the French data and
                                    maps which were not considered wholly reliable; the Department
                                    had therefore not yet approached the French Government on this
                                    matter; and that if and when any action was taken the Legation
                                    would be promptly advised.</p>
                                <p>“It does not appear from the information at the disposal of my
                                    Government that any further action has been taken by the
                                    Liberian Government since that date toward the renewal of
                                    negotiations with the French.</p>
                                <p>“Believing that future troubles can be avoided only through a
                                    definitive demarkation of the Franco-Liberian boundary, my
                                    Government directs me to suggest that the Liberian Government at
                                    this time approach the French Government through the Liberian
                                    Legation at Paris with the request that the French Government
                                    appoint and send a Boundary Commissioner to Liberia at the
                                    earliest possible date to complete the work of delimiting the
                                    boundary as defined by existing treaties and agreements.</p>
                                <p>“The American Ambassador in Paris has been informed of the
                                    existing situation and will be instructed to support the
                                    representations of the Liberian Minister in Paris as soon as my
                                    Government has received word that the Liberian representations
                                    are in fact being made.</p>
                                <p>“With regard to the reported border troubles and the occupation
                                    of disputed territory by French forces, it is suggested that the
                                    Liberian Minister in Paris be instructed to make representations
                                    to the <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0581"/>French
                                    Government with a view to preventing recurrences of the former

                                <p>“In connection with these questions, the American Ambassador at
                                    Paris will likewise be instructed to employ his good
                                    offices.</p>
                                <p>“Concerning the specific question of the French occupation of
                                    Zinta (Zigida), it is felt that a request for its evacuation by
                                    the French authorities during the period required for the
                                    completion of the demarkation of the boundary would not be
                                    unreasonable owing to the long continued occupation and
                                    administration of Zinta (Zigida) by the Liberian authorities.
                                    Nevertheless, in view of the greater importance of an early
                                    delimitation of the boundary, it is not believed that insistence
                                    on this point ought to be allowed to imperil the resumption of
                                    negotiations between the Liberian and French governments
                                    provided that the French Government evinces a desire to proceed
                                    immediately with the delimitation.</p>
                                <p>“If the Liberian Government should see fit to act upon the
                                    foregoing suggestions, I should be grateful to be informed of
                                    the action which it proposes to take in order that my Government
                                    may be advised accordingly.”</p>

                            statement of my understanding of the agreement reached through recent
                            conversations held at Washington on behalf of the Government of the
                            United States and the Government of Lithuania with reference to the
                            treatment which the United States shall accord to the commerce of

                        <p>These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two
                            Governments which is that, in respect of import and export duties and

                            transit, warehousing and other facilities, and the treatment of
                            commercial travelers’ samples, the United States will accord to
                            Lithuania, and Lithuania will accord to the United States, its
                            territories and possessions, unconditional most-favored-nation
                            treatment; and that in the matter of licensing or prohibitions of
                            imports and exports, each country, so far as it at any time maintains
                            such a system, will accord to the commerce of the other treatment as
                            favorable, with respect to commodities, valuations and quantities, as
                            may be accorded to the commerce of any other country.</p>

                        <p>Responsive to frequent communications demonstrating widespread interest
                            in the southwest in border conditions, this Department, in consultation
                            with the Treasury Department, has been giving serious consideration to
                            the problem of better enforcement of existing laws and of curtailing
                            certain evils and vices now existent along the Mexican border. A short
                            time ago, in response to an informal inquiry, advices were received from
                            the Mexican Embassy at this capital to the effect that the Mexican
                            Government was believed to be favorably disposed to negotiate with the
                            United States a Convention similar to that with Canada and that the
                            Mexican Government was then preparing a list of suggestions which the
                            Embassy would bring to the Department’s attention as soon as received.
                            It does not appear, however, that such a list has thus far been received
                            from the Embassy, but the Secretary of the Treasury has now suggested
                            that an informal conference be arranged between officials of this
                            Government and representatives of the United Mexican States to discuss
                            illicit traffic in narcotics, intoxicating liquor, tobacco, et cetera,
                            and to formulate a Convention along the lines of that negotiated with
                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>As it appears that there is no extradition treaty with Mexico covering
                            crimes and offences against the laws for the suppression of the <pb
                                n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0587"/>traffic in narcotics, it is
                            suggested that it would be desirable to endeavor to negotiate an
                            extradition convention with Mexico covering this subject. Such a
                            convention has been negotiated with Canada and it is expected that it
                            will be signed at an early date. A copy of this convention is also
                            enclosed for your confidential information.<note n="3" xml:id="d396fn3"

                                1925.</note></p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the Department desires that you bring this matter to the
                            attention of the Mexican Government with a view to arranging for an
                            informal preliminary conference of officials of the two governments for
                            the purpose of discussing the question of providing additional
                            facilities for the suppression of such illicit traffic between persons
                            residing in the two countries, and of drawing up draft conventions for
                            submission to the respective Governments for their consideration. You
                            will request to be acquainted with the views of the Mexican Government
                            in this matter and telegraph a brief report to the Department as soon as
                            you receive a reply.</p>

                            Sheffield on December 27th last the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            expressed willingness of Mexican Government in principle to conclude a
                            convention with the United States to suppress smuggling operations along
                            the border and also to participate in an informal conference in order to
                            formulate a convention regarding illicit traffic in narcotics etc.
                            Accordingly, on December 29th the Ambassador sent a formal note to the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs confirming the oral understanding and
                            enclosing copies of the Department’s press statement of June 6, 1924, as
                            well as of the pertinent articles of the conventions with Canada
                            including those of the proposed extradition convention for the
                            Minister’s confidential information. The note called attention to the
                            fact that the Department had not yet received Mexican Government’s
                            promised suggestions regarding improvement of conditions on the border
                            and requested advice as to the Mexican Government’s desires in
                            connection with the holding of informal preliminary conference to
                            discuss suppression of illicit traffic and to formulate draft
                            conventions.</p>
                        <p>No formal reply to this note has yet been received and Under Secretary of
                            Foreign Relations informs me today that the matter is still <pb n="506"

                            which has been urged to expedite consideration. Mexican Government
                            regards the question as of great importance and is anxious to proceed. I
                            am promised there will be no unnecessary delay so far as Foreign Office
                            is concerned.</p>

                        <p>39. Your 36, January 30, 3 P.M. If an Extradition Convention covering
                            narcotic cases could be signed promptly and approved during the brief
                            special session of the Senate after March 4th, it would be beneficial.
                            You will therefore please sound the Mexican Government but at the same
                            time make it clear that the suggestion in regard to the Narcotic
                            Convention is made merely because of the desirability of action on this
                            one phase of the general subject in view of the lapse of time before the
                            next session of the Senate, and that it is in no way suggested that the
                            plan for the Conference proposed in my mail instruction Number 89 of
                            December 17 last to discuss and establish bases for a Convention
                            covering the general subjects of smuggling, liquor control, et cetera,
                            be abandoned.</p>
                        <p>If the Mexican Government should agree that priority be given to an
                            Extradition Treaty covering offenses against the Narcotic Laws of both
                            countries, it is suggested that such a Convention be negotiated and
                            signed here, the Treaty with Canada being used as a basis therefor.</p>

                        <p>49. Department’s telegram 39, February 27, noon. Secretary of Foreign
                            Relations informed me this morning that he would immediately consult the
                            appropriate authorities with regard to the possibility of authorizing
                            the Mexican Ambassador at Washington to sign an extradition treaty
                            covering offenses against the narcotic laws of both countries along the
                            lines of our treaty with Canada and that he would inform me at the
                            earliest possible moment of the Government’s decision. Assuming that
                            there was no fundamental objection to this action he was fearful that it
                            would take 8 or 10 days in any case to prepare and to send to the
                            Mexican Ambassador full powers unless it could be arranged to authorize
                            the Ambassador by telegraph <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0589"/>to
                            sign the treaty and upon arrival of the full powers to consider them as
                            having been delivered earlier.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe there will be any objection on the part of the Mexican
                            Government to signing the treaty and hope to be able to report the
                            Government’s decision early next week.</p>
                        <p>I am also in receipt of a note dated February 24 in reply to my note of
                            December 29 referred to in Embassy’s telegram 36 of January 30, 3 p.m.
                            to the effect that the Mexican Government is disposed to conclude a

                            to be informed of their names for communication to the Mexican

                            telegraph should that Government concur, in order that the Department of

                                    and for injuries to American citizens of their rights. These
                                    Commissions are now sitting and will, in due time, adjudicate
                                    these claims. Conditions have improved and our Ambassador has
                                    succeeded in protecting American, as well as foreign, interests.
                                    Our relations with the Government are friendly but,
                                    nevertheless, conditions are not entirely satisfactory and we
                                    are looking to and expect the Mexican Government to restore
                                    properties illegally taken and to indemnify American
                                    citizens.</p>
                                <p>A great deal of property of Americans has been taken under or in
                                    violation of the Agrarian Laws for which no compensation has
                                    been made, and other properties practically ruined and, in one
                                    instance, taken by the Mexican Government on account of
                                    unreasonable demands of labor. Mr. Sheffield will have the full
                                    support of this government and we will insist that adequate
                                    protection under the recognized rules of international law be
                                    afforded American citizens. We believe it is the desire of the
                                    Mexican Government to carry out the Conventions and to indemnify
                                    American citizens for property taken. So long as we are
                                    satisfied that this is the policy of the <pb n="518"

                                    course of action is being carried out with a determination to
                                    meet its international obligations, that Government will have
                                    the support of the United States. I cannot go into the details
                                    of the many cases which Mr. Sheffield has taken up with the
                                    Mexican Government but they will be worked out as rapidly as
                                    possible.</p>
                                <p>I have seen the statements published in the press that another
                                    revolutionary movement may be impending in Mexico. I very much
                                    hope this is not true. This Government’s attitude toward Mexico
                                    and toward threatened revolutionary movements was clearly set
                                    forth in 1923 when there was such a movement threatening the
                                    constituted Government of that country,<note n="16"

                                    into solemn engagements with this Government and was making an
                                    effort to meet those obligations at home and abroad. The
                                    attitude taken by this Government at that time has since been
                                    maintained and it is now the policy of this Government to use
                                    its influence and lend its support in behalf of stability and
                                    orderly constitutional procedure, but it should be made clear
                                    that this Government will continue to support the Government in
                                    Mexico only so long as it protects American lives and American
                                    rights and complies with its international engagements and
                                    obligations. The Government of Mexico is now on trial before the
                                    world. We have the greatest interest in the stability,
                                    prosperity and independence of Mexico. We have been patient and
                                    realize, of course, that it takes time to bring about a stable
                                    government but we cannot countenance violation of her
                                    obligations and failure to protect American citizens.”</p>

                        <p>Declarations of the State Department have been published in which Mr.
                            Kellogg, answering some questions relating to the visit of Ambassador
                            Sheffield to said department, affirms that some properties of American
                            citizens have been illegally taken in Mexico for which no compensation
                            has been made and in one instance taken by the Mexican Government on
                            account of unreasonable demands of labor. At the same time he refers to
                            the Joint Claims Commissions stating that he is convinced that the
                            Mexican Government wishes to comply with the conventions and indemnify
                            for the properties taken from American citizens; that he has seen the
                            statements published in the press that another revolutionary movement
                            may be impending in Mexico and that the Department of State very much
                            hopes this is not true, the attitude of said department being to use its
                            influence <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0601"/>and lend its support
                            in behalf of stability and orderly constitutional procedure in Mexico,
                            but it makes clear that the American Government will continue to support
                            the Government in Mexico only so long as it protects American lives and
                            American rights and complies with its internal engagements and
                            obligations. He adds that the Government of Mexico is now on trial
                            before the world.</p>
                        <p>It is a duty for my Government to rectify said statements as required by
                            truth and justice. The best proof that Mexico is willing to comply with
                            her international obligations and to protect the life and interests of
                            foreigners lies in the fact that although, according to international
                            law, she was not bound to do it, she invited all the nations whose
                            citizens or subjects might have suffered damages through acts executed
                            during the political upheavals that have taken place in the country with
                            a view to conclude with them a convention to establish joint commissions
                            that might consider said damages in order to grant due indemnizations.
                            Besides that another convention was entered into with the United States
                            to adjust claims of citizens of both countries against the other and in
                            said convention are included all cases in which properties or rights
                            might have been affected in disagreement with the Mexican laws.
                            Therefore, so long as the aforesaid commissions do not adjust the cases
                            submitted to their decision, it is irrelevant to charge Mexico with
                            failure to protect American interests and violation of her international
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>The application of the Agrarian laws cannot be a subject of complaint
                            because Mexico has issued them in the exercise of her sovereignty, and
                            apart from that the State Department, in behalf of the American
                            citizens, has accepted the form of indemnization prescribed by Mexican
                            laws.</p>
                        <p>It is to be regretted the contradiction found in Mr. Kellogg’s statement,
                            when he declared that the United States have the greatest interest in
                            the maintenance of order in Mexico and in the stability of her
                            Government and at the same time stated that he had seen news of
                            revolutionary movements since this last affirmation, tends to cast some
                            alarm in the world in regard to the conditions of my country. And
                            finally the statement that the Government of the United States will
                            continue to support the Government of Mexico only so long as it protects
                            American interests and lives and complies with its international
                            engagements and obligations embodies a threat to the sovereignty of
                            Mexico that she cannot overlook and rejects with all energy because she
                            does not accord to any foreign country the right to intervene in any
                            form in her domestic affairs nor is she disposed to subordinate her
                            international relations to the exigencies of another country.</p>
                        <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0602"/>
                        <p>The statement under reference affirms also that the American Ambassador
                            has succeeded in protecting American as well as foreign interests, and
                            if he has thus succeeded he has no right to charge Mexico with failure
                            to protect said interests, and attention should be called to the fact
                            that said Ambassador does not represent any other foreigners but his own
                            fellow citizens, and Mexico could not admit that without her previous
                            authorization the American Ambassador should act in behalf of persons or
                            interests alien to those of his country.</p>
                        <p>If the Government of Mexico, as affirmed, is now on trial before the
                            world, such is the case with the Government of the United States as well
                            as those of other countries. But if it is to be understood that Mexico
                            is on trial in the guise of a dependant, my Government absolutely
                            rejects with energy such imputation, which in essence would only mean an
                            insult.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, I declare that my Government, conscious of the obligations
                            imposed by international law, is determined to comply with them, and
                            therefore to extend due protection to the lives and interests of
                            foreigners; that it only accepts and hopes to receive the help and
                            support of all the other countries based on a sincere and loyal
                            cooperation and according to the invariable practice of international
                            friendship, but in no way it shall admit that a Government of any nation
                            may pretend to create a privileged situation for its nationals in the
                            country, nor shall it either accept any foreign interference contrary to
                            the rights and sovereignty of Mexico.</p>

                        <p>133. The following is for your information and guidance: The Secretary’s
                            statement will be allowed to stand. The Department will make no
                            supplementary comment for publication. It does not consider making a
                            retort to the reply of President Calles.</p>
                        <p>When Ambassador Téllez called at the Department this morning it was
                            pointed out to him that the Secretary’s statement should tend to augment
                            the position of President Calles. It was also stated that although
                            President Calles’ interpretation of the Secretary’s statement and his
                            retort were matters of surprise and regret to the Department,
                            nevertheless, the Secretary would not recede from his position.
                            Ambassador Téllez expressed his belief that the Secretary’s statement
                            need not be regarded as antagonistic to President Calles personally, and
                            he said he would inform his Government in that sense.</p>
                        <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0603"/>
                        <p>The attention of the Ambassador was invited in a cursory way to the large
                            number of vexatious and longstanding cases still awaiting satisfactory
                            disposition, and to other features of the Mexican situation, and the
                            impression was conveyed to him that the attitude of this Government
                            towards his Government was no different from the one which we would
                            assume toward any Government which might treat American interests with
                            contumely. It was intended that the conversation should contain the
                            implication that unless the Government of Mexico saw to it that a fair
                            deal was given to Americans and American interests it could hardly
                            expect continued encouragement by our Government and without a logical
                                <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> of satisfactory treatment it
                            could not reasonably look for countenance and support.</p>
                        <p>The Department hopes that after the initial excitement has subsided and
                            that after the rallying of dissenting groups around President Calles, in
                            view of the fancied threat of foreign interference, has ceased, the
                            point of the statement of June 12 will make an impression, and that the
                            better and more conservative elements of the Government will endeavor to
                            support President Calles in carrying out a program which was so
                            auspiciously inaugurated but which unfortunately has been deviated
                            from.</p>

                                    (México, Antigua Imprenta de Murguía, 1922), quinta época, tomo
                                        <hi rend="smallcaps">x</hi>, p. 1308.</note> has held that
                                the article is not retroactive so far as it relates to persons
                                holding petroleum lands who have, before the Constitution went into
                                effect, performed some positive act showing an intention to exercise
                                the petroleum rights. It is not clearly specified in the bill, and
                                the language thereof does not necessarily imply, that it is the <pb
                                    n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0606"/>intention of the bill to
                                cover lands, rights and interests of stockholders acquired before
                                the Constitution was promulgated. The full effect of the bill, if it
                                becomes a law, would depend upon interpretations made by the courts
                                and by the Mexican Government. If a law prohibiting foreigners from
                                owning lands and being stockholders in Mexican corporations does not
                                affect vested rights acquired before the Constitution was
                                promulgated, then it relates to a purely domestic policy, and this
                                Government has no suggestions to make thereon. American interests
                                which have protested against the law have not conclusively proved
                                that it would necessarily affect rights acquired before the
                                Constitution was promulgated. According to the familiar principles
                                of construction applied under the Constitution of the United States
                                and practice, the courts must construe a statute, whenever possible,
                                so as to preserve its constitutionality, and I incline to the view
                                that the bill under consideration is capable of being construed in a
                                way which would prevent it from affecting American interests vested
                                before the Constitution came into force.</item>

                            <item>If, under the Constitution of Mexico after it was promulgated,
                                Mexican companies having American stockholders legally could acquire
                                lands, waters, and the appurtenances thereto, or could secure
                                concessions to develop mines, waters and mineral fuels, either
                                within or without prohibited zones, according to our understanding
                                of the practice, this law seemingly would deprive them of that right
                                since by the first part of section 6, those aliens who may have
                                acquired in prohibited zones any real property rights to waters and
                                their accessions [<hi rend="italic">appurtenances</hi>?] as
                                shareholders in Mexican companies before the law came into force,

                            <item>Under these circumstances the Department deems it unwise to
                                address a note on this subject to the Government of Mexico at
                                present. It is our feeling that if the present Government intends to
                                pass the bill, a note from this Government would not stop its
                                passage. In fact, such action might hasten its passage and even
                                render it difficult for the administration to amend the bill, were
                                it so inclined.</item>

                                is for you to obtain an interview with the Foreign Minister and in a
                                frank and friendly way point out to him those provisions in the bill
                                which if applied retroactively would affect American vested
                                interests both before and after the promulgation of the Mexican
                                Constitution as set forth above. Possibly in the course of your
                                conversation you can obtain a clearer idea of the scope of the bill.

                        <p>223. Department’s telegram 240 October 29, 7 p.m. I saw the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon and was received by him with entire
                            courtesy and friendliness. I informed him that I had come for the
                            purpose of requesting information regarding the purport of the bill sent
                            to the Chamber of Deputies September 30 last regulating the first
                            section of article 27 of the Federal Constitution and that I had not
                            come to enter into any discussion of the matter. He said that the bill
                            had been substantially modified since its introduction and intimated
                            that for this reason discussion at this time might be inopportune.
                            Having pointed out that the purpose <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526"
                                facs="0608"/>of my visit was merely to elucidate certain obscure
                            points I proceeded to put to him the questions raised in section 2 of
                            your telegram mentioned and received the following answers.</p>
                        <p>With regard to question I (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>), the period within which foreigners may divest
                            themselves of real property interests within the prohibited zone whether
                            held directly or through a Mexican corporation will be extended probably
                            to 10 years but such divestiture must be effected regardless of the time
                            when the interest was acquired.</p>
                        <p>With regard to question II (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), interests of
                            foreigners in corporations in excess of 50 percent acquired before the
                            proposed law becomes effective will be respected. Question II (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>), the declaration to be made regarding the
                            interest held by foreigners in real property outside the prohibited zone
                            will not be directed specifically to the renunciation of rights as an
                            alien but will be designed to determine the character of alien ownership
                            with a view to recording necessary information regarding alien holders
                            of such interests.</p>
                        <p>With regard to question III, article 4 of the bill is not intended to
                            have retroactive application.</p>
                        <p>With regard to question IV, article 5 of the bill has been modified in
                            affirmative terms to the effect that foreigners may acquire not to
                            exceed 50 percent ownership in companies for agricultural purposes and
                            will not have retroactive effect. The declaration contemplated by the
                            second half of article 6 will also be descriptive merely to obtain
                            necessary records of ownership by aliens.</p>
                        <p>With regard to question V, the proposed law is merely designed to
                            regulate section 1 of article 27 of the Constitution and does not affect
                            the stipulations of section 4 of article 27, which latter has to do
                            among other things with subsoil deposits.</p>
                        <p>The Minister explained that the general purpose of the proposed law is to
                            obviate complications with foreign governments resulting from the

                            will still be able to acquire, own and administer the lands necessary
                            for their establishments and for the services necessary for carrying out
                            their objects having in mind of course the concession principal so far
                            as subsoil deposits themselves are concerned.</p>
                        <p>I understand in brief that the proposed law will not be in conflict with
                            the provisions of section 4 of article 27.</p>

                            be presented at this time. I should add that during the past few days a

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: With reference to my
                            conversation with you on Tuesday last, in which you were kind enough to
                            inform me of the instructions which had been addressed to the United
                            States Ambassador in Mexico in the matter of the Mexican Draft
                            Corporation Law, I write to say that I have now received a communication
                            from His Majesty’s Government, stating that they have instructed the
                            British Representative in Mexico City to address verbal enquiries to the
                            Mexican Government on similar lines to those which the United States
                            Representative has been authorised to make. In approaching the Mexican
                            Government, Mr. King has been told to avoid any reference to the
                            possible attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the event of the bill
                            in question only being intended to apply to the future. Should his
                            enquiries elicit the information that the Mexican Government intend to
                            give retroactive force to this legislation, Mr. King has been instructed
                            to direct their attention to the provision in Article 14 of the
                            Constitution, according to which, “no law may be made retroactive to the
                            prejudice of any person”. His Majesty’s Government have also pointed out
                            to him that he should use every endeavour to secure the amendment or
                            withdrawal of clauses in the bill relating to foreigners, which, if
                            given retroactive force, would have such a prejudicial effect upon the
                            position of British subjects holding investments in industrial concerns
                            in Mexico. He has also been instructed to keep in close touch with his
                            United States Colleague, and with the Representatives in Mexico City of
                            the other Governments whose nationals are affected.</p>

                            leads to the belief that new detailed discussion of the proposed
                            legislation affecting foreign property in Mexico is inopportune and
                            perhaps useless, and that the situation <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528"

                            textually the following message from me, leaving with him, if you deem

                            <p>“I am moved to make this personal appeal to you in the hope that the
                                clouds which I perceive on the horizon of friendship between the
                                United States and Mexico may be removed, and I beg of you please to
                                understand that I am speaking to you solely on the basis of
                                friendship and wish to avoid any criticism of prospective
                                legislation of a neighboring friendly and sovereign State. It is in
                                fact to avoid even a semblance of such an attitude that I am taking
                                this step and may I ask that this appeal be taken up by you with the
                                President of the Republic, for whom we have such high regard and
                                esteem, and deep personal appreciation of his high qualities formed
                                during his brief sojourn in the United States before entering into
                                office.</p>
                            <p>As long ago as July, 1924, notes were exchanged by you and Ambassador
                                    Warren,<note n="28" xml:id="d416fn28">On July 18 and 21, 1924;
                                    not printed.</note> in which it was agreed to negotiate a new
                                Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two countries. The
                                impediments to the negotiation of such a Treaty now no longer exist,
                                and I venture to suggest to Your Excellency the opportuneness of
                                beginning such negotiations now, in order that a firmer basis of
                                mutual relationship which can only redound to the advantage of the
                                two countries and their nationals be formed. Please understand that
                                I venture to make this suggestion in the most friendly spirit
                                possible. We are convinced that a Treaty can be negotiated which
                                will be fair and satisfactory to both countries and of lasting
                                benefit to Mexico.</p>
                            <p>I am not moved to make this suggestion because of the present
                                proposed legislation in Mexico. It is, however, futile at such long
                                distance to attempt to reach any understanding with you in regard to
                                the effects of such legislation. Furthermore, nothing could be
                                further from my intention than to seem to wish to interfere with the
                                free course of legislation in your country. There are certain
                                considerations, however, which must cause immediate concern.
                                Americans with acquired rights will appeal to this Government, which
                                is naturally bound to do its utmost on their behalf. The situation
                                may become extremely confused and we must always bear in mind both
                                the letter and spirit of the proceedings of the United
                                States–Mexican Commission, convened in Mexico City on May 14, 1923.
                                However, I do not wish to enter into any discussion of this matter,
                                and I venture to hope that there will be no necessity thereof, as I
                                am loath to believe that the Mexican Government intends to take any
                                action in contravention of that understanding. The Mexican
                                Government surely has in mind the economic aspects and consequences
                                of such legislation. I do not desire to assume the role of uninvited
                                adviser.</p>
                            <p>Let us take a broad view of this matter. My stand is that I dislike
                                to discuss details of the proposed legislation, but I can not help
                                but hope that nothing will be done which will tend to affect the
                                good relations between the two countries which we have so much at
                                heart, <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0611"/>and make a
                                continuation of the mutually constructive policy initiated during
                                the presidency of President Obregon impossible.</p>
                            <p>I beg of you, therefore, Mr. Minister, to accept this appeal in the
                                same friendly spirit from which it springs, and I await with
                                interest and confidence the response of President Calles and
                                yourself.”</p>

                        <p>You may, if in subsequent discussion it appears timely, suggest orally to

                        <p>245. According to the local press, Foreign Office reports that it has
                            received nothing in the nature of a protest against the bill to regulate
                            section 1 of article 27. Anxiety is expressed by several of my
                            colleagues including those of France, Great Britain, and the
                            Netherlands, as well as by interested American citizens, that action in
                            the Senate to pass the bill may be precipitated because of a belief that
                            the subject is one of prestige for the Government in respect of public
                            opinion. I think the bill will probably be passed, without material
                            changes, in the near future. I suggest, therefore, that the Department
                            formulate its observations on the bill and send me instructions. Subject
                            to the approval of the Department and in case the passage of the bill
                            should appear imminent, I would use the Department’s observations in
                            making appropriate representations to the Government of Mexico if
                            necessary before the receipt of reply of Foreign Office to your message
                            of November 13, but otherwise would withhold them until such reply had
                            been received. What I have in mind is to forestall possibility of Mexico
                            claiming later that the United States never made any specific protest
                            against the bill.</p>

                            <p>“Since my <hi rend="italic">aide-memoire</hi> of November 17, I have
                                been advised that the bill regulating fraction 1 of Article 27 of
                                the Mexican Constitution has passed the Chamber of Deputies and a
                                copy of the bill in the form in which it was passed has reached me.
                                In these circumstances, I am moved to renew the sentiments expressed
                                in the said <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> and at the same time
                                to present some further considerations bearing more directly upon
                                the pending legislation which was there only incidentally referred
                                to for purposes of illustration.</p>
                            <p>I think I should not be acting in a truly friendly spirit if I were
                                to refrain from advising you that this bill, proposed as it is by
                                your Government and passed by the Chamber of Deputies is viewed with
                                genuine apprehension by many if not all American holders of property
                                rights in Mexico. And I should be less than sincere if I did not say
                                to you at this time that in my judgment such apprehension is
                                justified. Numerous appeals and protests have been, and are being,
                                received by me. An examination of the bill in its present form
                                enforces the conviction that in certain of its features the measure
                                operates retroactively with respect to American property interests
                                in Mexico and that its effect upon them would be plainly
                                confiscatory. Rights which have become vested by virtue of the laws
                                and Constitution of Mexico existing at the time of acquisition would
                                be seriously impaired, if not utterly destroyed. Without here
                                entering upon a detailed analysis, let me indicate some of the
                                principal provisions and my understanding of their effect. The
                                requirement that a foreign holder of corporate stock, without regard
                                to when his holdings were acquired, shall consider himself a Mexican
                                national as to such stock, and renounce the right to appeal to his
                                own government or in the alternative forfeit his interests amounts
                                to substantial confiscation. The requirement that stock in Mexican
                                companies for agricultural purposes may not under any circumstances
                                be held, regardless of when the stock was acquired, if such holding
                                places in the hands of foreigners 50 per cent or more of the total
                                interest of the company, is likewise retroactive and confiscatory.
                                The requirement that all companies for agricultural purposes, more
                                than 50 per cent of whose stock is in foreign hands, whether they
                                hold lands directly or indirectly, shall divest themselves of such
                                property within 10 years of the date of promulgation of the law is,
                                by its terms, applicable to existing rights legally vested, and is,
                                therefore, confiscatory of those rights. The subsequent provision
                                permitting present individual owners to retain until their death
                                such rights only mitigates and postpones but does not eliminate the
                                confiscatory feature.</p>
                            <p>I desire particularly to direct attention to the provision requiring
                                foreigners to waive their nationality and to agree not to invoke the
                                protection of their respective governments, so far as their property
                                rights are concerned, under penalty of forfeiture. In this
                                connection <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0613"/>it is my duty to
                                point out that my Government, in accordance with principles
                                generally if not universally accepted, has always consistently
                                declined to concede that such a waiver can annul the relation of a
                                citizen to his own Government or that it can operate to extinguish
                                the obligation of his government by diplomatic intervention to
                                protect him in the event of a denial of justice within the
                                recognized principles of international law.</p>
                            <p>You will, I am sure, understand that I am impelled to make the
                                foregoing observations which are submitted in the most friendly
                                spirit, because I feel that you are entitled to a frank expression
                                of the views of my Government, and I should not like to leave any
                                room for misunderstanding between us. As I stated in my <hi
                                    rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of the 17th instant, my
                                Government wished to avoid if possible any criticism of prospective
                                legislation of a neighboring and sovereign State, for it recognizes
                                to the fullest extent the right of any other Government by
                                legislation to regulate the ownership of property as a purely
                                domestic question, unless such regulation operates to divest prior
                                vested rights of American citizens legally acquired or held under
                                the laws of such foreign government, and it is only because of the
                                seeming imminence of the passage of such legislation and because it
                                does so affect the vested rights of American citizens and is in
                                contravention of the understanding arrived at between the two
                                Governments through their Commissioners that I am moved to make
                                these representations.”</p>

                            <p>I have transmitted to the President the personal appeal which you in
                                a friendly manner were good enough to make to me in order
                                legitimately to remove the clouds which you say you perceive upon
                                the horizon of friendship between Mexico and the United States,
                                without thereby implying in the slightest a criticism of the
                                legislation which Mexico as a sovereign state is at present
                                elaborating.</p>
                            <p>After asserting the foregoing you are pleased to propose the
                                negotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between the two
                                nations, a treaty of which there has been talk since July 1924. You
                                now judge that there are no longer any impediments to its
                                conclusion, so that it may serve as a pledge for the establishment
                                of the mutual relations of both countries upon a firm basis.</p>
                            <p>You again add that the proposal of the treaty has no connection with
                                the pending legislation in Mexico. You say, however, that there are
                                certain considerations that are now causing you concern, and you
                                refer to the fact that American citizens who have acquired rights in
                                this country will appeal to your Government which is naturally bound
                                to do its utmost on their behalf. Therefore you believe that the
                                situation may become extremely confused and intimate that the two
                                Governments must always bear in mind the letter and spirit of the
                                proceedings of the Mixed Commission which convened in Mexico City on
                                May 14, 1923, the conclusions of which you do not believe that the
                                Mexican Government wishes to contravene, and you call attention to
                                the economic aspects and consequences of the new legislation.</p>
                            <p>You finally express the hope that nothing will be done which might
                                affect the good relations between the two countries, and that the
                                mutually constructive policy initiated during the Presidency of
                                General Obregón will be continued.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing has been considered by President Calles, and he
                                requests me to say to you as follows: <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539"

                                    <p>“In his opinion there is absolutely no cause for perceiving
                                        clouds upon the horizon of friendship between Mexico and the
                                        United States since the Mexican Government is disposed, as
                                        it has ever been, to fulfill all the obligations imposed
                                        upon it by international law, and since surely the United
                                        States will be under no necessity to contravene them. The
                                        Mexican Government, therefore, is disposed to negotiate with
                                        the United States a treaty of amity and commerce provided
                                        such treaty shall protect the legitimate interests of both
                                        countries and bear a character of strict and effective
                                        reciprocity and of recognition of and respect for the
                                        sovereignty of the two contracting parties. You manifest a
                                        decided intention of not wishing to interfere with the
                                        Mexican legislation which is being elaborated nor of
                                        criticising it; but as you repeatedly refer to it, I am
                                        constrained to understand that it is this legislation which
                                        causes you concern and which you believe may injure American
                                        interests and conflict with the friendly spirit of the
                                        conversations of Messrs. González Roa and Ross, on the one
                                        hand, and Messrs. Warren and Payne, on the other, in May
                                        1923. Therefore I wish to make to you the following
                                        explanations: <list>
                                            <item>“1. The conferences which took place on the
                                                above-mentioned date of May 1923, did not result in
                                                any formal agreement other than that of the claims
                                                conventions which were signed after the resumption
                                                of diplomatic relations. Those conferences were
                                                limited to an exchange of views intended to see if
                                                it was possible for the two countries to renew those
                                                diplomatic relations, and during the conferences
                                                President Obregón explained through his
                                                Commissioners his intention to follow a policy of
                                                understanding with the United States as well as with
                                                the other countries of the world—a policy which, in
                                                the main, consists of extending a friendly reception
                                                to foreigners and capital that would settle in
                                                Mexico and giving them the guarantees which are
                                                granted to them by our laws.</item>
                                            <item>“2. The legislation pending in the Chambers which
                                                in any way refers to foreigners is based precisely
                                                on this policy. For example, the law which regulates
                                                section 1 of article 27, which has been approved by
                                                the Chamber of Deputies and which is pending in the
                                                Senate Chamber, has respected in their entirety
                                                acquired rights, as an unbiased examination can
                                                prove.</item>
                                        </list></p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, this legislation has been inspired with the
                                        object of eliminating the vagueness in this section, which
                                        was much more injurious to the very foreigners it concerned.
                                        It embodies only the practice towards foreigners that has
                                        been followed from 1917 to the present, without any protest
                                        being heard from them in years. I should regret if you were
                                        misinformed in this regard and, without any wish to assume
                                        the part of adviser, I take the liberty to call your
                                        attention to the very human fact that individuals and
                                        capital are generally opposed to any innovation, even though
                                        such innovation does not mean any invasion of their
                                        rights.”</p>

                            <p>With the foregoing explanations I wish to say to you that the
                                President and I are inspired by the best wishes to continue
                                cultivating the good relations between Mexico and the United States,
                                and I repeat again, that we should view with much pleasure the
                                initiation <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0622"/>of negotiations
                                for a treaty of amity and commerce between the two countries since
                                the treaty could contain only fair stipulations which would not
                                establish undue privileges for the respective citizens nor attempt
                                to obstruct in any way the sovereign power to legislate to which
                                both nations are entitled within the bounds of international
                                law.</p>
                            <p>I believe that in this way I am showing you the friendly manner in
                                which both President Calles and I have received your personal
                                appeal, and I now renew the expression of my high consideration.</p>

                            <p>I have given due attention to your memorandum of the 27th of
                                November, last,<note n="40" xml:id="d421fn40">See telegram No. 264,

                                    Nov. 13, to the Ambassador in Mexico, <ref target="#pg_527">p.
                                        527</ref>.</note> you state that the circumstance of the law
                                regulating article 27 of the Mexican Constitution having been
                                approved by the Chamber of Deputies, moves you to present some
                                further considerations directly relating to the said pending
                                legislation, and you add that you would consider that you were not
                                acting in an entirely friendly spirit if you were to refrain from
                                advising me that the law in question is viewed with apprehension by
                                many American citizens holding property rights in Mexico. You were
                                good enough to conclude that, in your <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541"
                                    facs="0623"/>judgment, such an apprehension is justified because
                                some features of the law regulating section 1 of article 27 operate
                                retroactively and with manifestly confiscatory effect.</p>
                            <p>You then go on to analyze some of these features to which I propose
                                to refer immediately in order to refute the criticism which you make
                                of the law under project as being retroactive and confiscatory. But
                                first I wish to make certain comments of a general nature.</p>
                            <p>In the first place, and even in a spirit of perfect friendship, the
                                fact is extraordinary that the American Government should make
                                representations to that of Mexico in regard to the pending
                                legislation which, precisely because of being in a formative state,
                                can cause no present injury to American citizens, and therefore it
                                seems preferable to know the definite scope of the laws after they
                                have been put into effect, since only then would we be able to
                                appreciate whether the above-mentioned legislation is prejudicial to
                                any rights or persons. The circumstance that there is an exception
                                made to the effect that the observations in regard to such
                                legislation are made in a friendly spirit does not prevent the
                                possibility that suspicious minds may believe that it involves
                                pressure upon the legislative bodies in order that the projected
                                legislation be not approved, especially since these observations are
                                preceded by press publications, which, although I am sure do not
                                emanate officially from the respective offices, certainly originate
                                therein.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore I understand that within the territory of the United
                                States there are laws in force very similar to the one which is now
                                pending the approval of the Mexican Senate denying to foreigners the
                                very rights to which reference is made in the organic law of section
                                1 of article 27 of the Constitution, and which restrict and regulate
                                in many cases the right to acquire and possess land. Then, too,
                                according to a well-recognized principle of the law of nations, a
                                nation must not claim as a violation of rights those not granted by
                                itself, and therefore it is not fitting that the United States
                                should attempt to prevent Mexico from adopting such laws in the
                                exercise of her sovereignty.</p>
                            <p>I take the liberty of calling your attention to the legislation which
                                exists in the State of Illinois, regulating the acquisition of real
                                property by foreigners. This comprises exactly the same provisions
                                contained in the legislation approved by the Mexican Chamber of
                                Deputies, but more extreme, since the period given for foreigners to
                                divest themselves of their properties is very much shorter than that
                                contemplated by the Mexican law, and the penalty imposed for the
                                infraction of its provisions is the future loss of the real property
                                or of the pertinent rights in favor of the State of Illinois. This
                                law is surely more drastic, more conclusive, and goes further in its
                                effects than the projected Mexican legislation.</p>
                            <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0624"/>
                            <p>Referring now to the aims of the projected legislation, you are
                                advised that it merely tends to avoid in general an abuse which the
                                very jurisprudence of the United States decries. No person may
                                acquire through a company, property which he is not permitted to
                                possess directly. Devlin, page 259, paragraph 224, says:<note n="42"

                                    an act is a violation of the law prohibiting corporations from

                            </quote>
                            <p>Moreover, the legislation pending the approval of Congress is not a
                                novelty in our system. The present Constitution has consecrated it
                                for several years and it has been applied without opposition on the
                                part of foreigners up to the present time; other laws, as well, have
                                consecrated it for some time; for example, the railroad law,
                                promulgated as far back as the 29th of April, 1899, in article 49,
                                establishes that all railroad enterprises must always be Mexican,
                                even though the company has been organized abroad, and even though
                                all or some of its members be foreigners; the company itself will be
                                subject to the tribunals of the Republic, whether federal or local,
                                in all affairs over which they may have jurisdiction in accordance
                                with the laws; the enterprise and all foreigners and their
                                successors who may take part in the business of the company, whether
                                they be shareholders, employees, or in any other character, will be
                                considered as Mexicans in everything related to the company; they
                                may never allege, in regard to the titles and affairs related to the
                                enterprise, any rights as foreigners under any pretext whatsoever
                                and will only have the right and means of making such rights
                                effective as the laws of the Republic grant to Mexicans, foreign
                                diplomatic agents, therefore, having no right to interfere.</p>
                            <p>The mining law, in force since the 25th of November, 1909, in turn
                                establishes restrictions for the acquisition on the part of
                                foreigners of titles to mining property in a fixed zone on the
                                frontier with foreign countries, and establishes the procedure which
                                must be followed in the cases in which the pertinent provisions are
                                not fulfilled.</p>
                            <p>Having made the foregoing explanations, and since I do not wish the
                                idea to remain in your mind that the Mexican bill is retroactive and
                                confiscatory, I shall proceed to examine the observations which you
                                were good enough to make.</p>
                            <p>You refer to the provision which requires that a foreigner owning
                                shares in companies having real property must agree before the
                                Minister for Foreign Affairs to consider himself as a national in
                                regard <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0625"/>to the part of the
                                property which is his share in the company, and not to invoke the
                                protection of his government in respect to the same under penalty of
                                forfeiture to the Nation of such property. In this connection you
                                call my attention particularly to the fact that your Government has
                                always declined to concede that repudiation of nationality made by a
                                citizen can deprive the Government of the United States from using
                                diplomatic intervention in case of a denial of justice.</p>
                            <p>Beyond the fact that the provision to which you allude is not new,
                                that is to say, beyond the fact that it does not emanate from the
                                law now pending before the Senate Chamber but proceeds from the
                                Mexican Constitution of 1917, for which reason your observations;
                                seem inopportune, I take the liberty, in my turn, to reply to you
                                that it is a universally accepted principle that every nation is
                                sovereign to legislate in the matter of real property within its own
                                territory. In consequence of this principle Mexico would be able to
                                prevent all foreigners from acquiring such property within its
                                jurisdiction and very justly may regulate the acquisitions of this
                                kind because it is a principle of logic that he who can do the
                                greater can do the lesser.</p>
                            <p>You observe particularly that the requirement of an agreement before
                                the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to which you have referred, is made
                                without taking into account the date of the acquisition of the
                                shares which the foreigner holds, by which you surely pretend to
                                insinuate that the requirement should not be exacted of foreigners
                                who acquired shares previous to 1917.</p>
                            <p>Possibly the foregoing statement is due to a lack of study of the law
                                since, in article 5, it is clearly established that foreigners who
                                may have acquired property or shares in Mexican companies will have
                                all their rights respected, and precisely for this purpose it has
                                been provided that a declaration be made before the Ministry for
                                Foreign Affairs in respect to the rights which may have been
                                acquired before the entry into effect of the law.</p>
                            <p>I sincerely believe that even supposing that those who might have
                                acquired, before the entry into effect of the law, real property or
                                shares in companies, should have to make the agreement required by
                                the Constitution, this would not conflict with international law
                                since, although it is well known that in accordance with such
                                international principles, acquired rights may not be injured, in the
                                case of the agreement no right is injured, since foreigners are at
                                liberty to make at any moment the agreement under reference with the
                                Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and since, especially, that which the
                                principles of international law assure the foreigner is the respect
                                of his property rights, but not respect of these rights as they
                                existed <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0626"/>at the time of the
                                acquisition, since this would be to deny to a sovereign nation the
                                right of imposing upon all those who inhabit its territory the
                                modifications and regulations necessary for the defense of its
                                interests, and would make impossible its subsequent development.</p>
                            <p>I call your attention, on the other hand, to the fact that the
                                agreement required by section 1 of article 27 of the Constitution,
                                has been ill named a renouncement of nationality. Such a
                                renouncement does not exist and it is merely a question of an
                                agreement of limited and special effects.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the legal provisions in effect in Mexico in this connection
                                are not obligatory since, although it is a requisite required by the
                                law that in order that a foreigner may acquire real property he must
                                obtain the permission of the Government, the foreigner who does not
                                wish to acquire it is not obliged to do so; but from the moment in
                                which he consents to submit to these regulations it must be
                                considered that he has undertaken a voluntary contract which
                                entails, as a consequence, not the renouncement of his nationality,
                                but the agreement not to invoke diplomatic protection in those
                                matters in regard to which he has voluntarily agreed to consider
                                himself as a Mexican, merely for the effects of the acquisition of
                                such rights, submitting himself thus to the guarantees and recourses
                                established by domestic laws. I consider, furthermore, that the
                                Government of the United States will not come to believe that the
                                object of these provisions might be that the Mexican authorities
                                have the deliberate aim of committing acts of injustice against
                                foreign citizens and against bona fide foreign investments.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I should also like to point out to you that this
                                constitutional provision is less rigorous than that which certain
                                states of the American Union require of foreigners, to wit: That of
                                being bona fide residents within the limits of such states or of
                                taking out first papers of American citizenship, in order to allow
                                them to acquire rights to real property, and going so far in this
                                direction as to require American citizenship even for the obtainment
                                of labor as employees or servants of a certain class. Among others,
                                the State of Arizona has established that no person might hereafter
                                acquire titles or property within the State unless he be a citizen
                                of the United States or have declared previously his intention of
                                becoming such. And the same law establishes that no corporation,
                                more than 30 percent of whose shares are in the possession of
                                persons not citizens of the United States or who may have declared
                                their intention of becoming such, may acquire lands, titles or
                                interests, therein. (Civil Code, Arizona, 1913, chapter 3, section
                                4716.)</p>
                            <p>The provision which includes the requirements of this permission for
                                foreign shareholders in Mexican companies is a consequence, as <pb
                                    n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0627"/>has already been said, of
                                the general principle established by the Mexican Constitution that
                                in order that foreigners may obtain the ownership of lands, waters,
                                and their accessions, or concessions for the development of mines,
                                waters, or combustible minerals, must obtain a permit from the
                                Ministry of Foreign Affairs and make an agreement to consider
                                themselves as Mexicans as regards the acquisition of such rights.
                                Furthermore, it proceeds from the policy of the American Government,
                                which not only makes claims for foreign companies but even for
                                Mexican companies. As a result of this policy it follows that
                                foreign shareholders in Mexican companies not only enjoy the
                                advantages of the laws of the country but, in addition, foreign
                                diplomatic protection, a serious inequality for the development of
                                Mexican companies which have no foreign shareholders.</p>
                            <p>It might be objected that the permission which foreign shareholders
                                in Mexican companies must obtain in order to acquire rights therein
                                will be an obstacle for corporations from the moment in which, in
                                order to buy any share, a previous permission would have to be
                                requested, but such would not be the case. In regard to shares
                                payable to the bearer it will not be necessary that the bearers
                                obtain the permission in every case; it will be quite sufficient
                                that in the charter of the company it will be established that the
                                shares payable to bearer must have inscribed upon them the
                                obligatory provisions with the requirement that the acquisition of
                                the shares is tantamount to an agreement on the part of the acquirer
                                to consider himself as a Mexican national in regard to the
                                acquisition of such titles, whereby the purchase of the share will
                                be implicitly considered as subordinate to the requirement of the
                                permission established by the Mexican Constitution.</p>
                            <p>In this connection I must inform you, as a proof, that this
                                requirement has been so understood by all the unprejudiced companies
                                operating in Mexico, which for several years have inscribed in their
                                charters and upon their bonds this provision, thus anticipating what
                                the law in project establishes, and acting in accordance with the
                                spirit of the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>Since 1920, among others, the Consolidated Oil Company of Mexico and
                                the Marland Oil Company of Mexico, S. A., and others have followed
                                such a course, anticipating, as I have said, the provisions of the
                                law under study.</p>
                            <p>You then go on to examine the requirement that shares in Mexican
                                companies having agricultural purposes cannot, under any
                                circumstances, accumulate in excess of 50 percent in foreign hands,
                                and you say that this provision is retroactive and confiscatory. I
                                suppose you will not charge that it is so as regards the future, and
                                therefore I shall limit myself to analyzing its effect on the past.
                                You will observe <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0628"/>in the
                                appropriate provisions of the organic law on which I am commenting
                                that a long period is given to foreigners in which to divest
                                themselves of their shares in such companies in excess of 50
                                percent. Therefore, the provision is not confiscatory, because the
                                right is recognized, and only its transformation is required. This
                                provision is not retroactive either, because it does not injure
                                acquired rights since, as I said above, the form in which a
                                foreigner holds a right may be changed by a sovereign nation as long
                                as the right in its essence is respected.</p>
                            <p>The limitation imposed by the law upon companies possessing rural
                                property for agricultural purposes tends to preclude possible
                                conflicts in the application of agrarian legislation—since it is
                                considered advisable to reserve the ownership and cultivation of the
                                greater part of the land for Mexicans. Thus any possible chance of
                                diplomatic discussion is eliminated, and this redounds to the direct
                                and immediate benefit of the cordiality of our relations with other
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>In regard to the permission for the present owners to preserve their
                                rights until their death, the only thing that might be adduced is
                                that the law puts a limitation upon the right of inheritance, which
                                is in strict conformity with international law since, in such cases,
                                there are no acquired rights, but simply an expectation of acquiring
                                them. This has been practiced by the United States where there exist
                                several laws on this matter, and Devlin, in the above-mentioned work
                                on pages 260 and 261, paragraph 226, citing hundreds of authorities,
                                    says:<note n="43" xml:id="d421fn43">Quoted in English in the

                                    law. The treaties of 1783 and 1794 between the United States and
                                    Great Britain were held to provide only for titles existing at
                                    the time of the making of the treaties and not titles
                                    subsequently acquired, and hence British subjects born before
                                    the Revolution were held to be equally incapable with those born
                                    after of inheriting or transmitting the inheritance of lands.
                                    Aliens, however, could inherit real estate under the laws of

                                have the firm intention of doing nothing but what is just, fair, and
                                allowable under international law.</p>
                            <p>I believe that the foregoing will be sufficient to convince you that
                                the law in project, although it entails for foreigners the necessity
                                of fulfilling certain acts to place themselves in harmony with it,
                                does not disregard any of their rights. And as further explanation I
                                wish to repeat to you what I noted in my memorandum of November 28th
                                    [<hi rend="italic">26th</hi>],<note n="44" xml:id="d421fn44"><hi

                                    538</ref>.</note> to wit: that the provisions contained in the
                                legislation on which you have been good enough to make observations
                                have already been put in practice for the last 7 years in conformity
                                with the various decrees and proclamations of the Executive, who
                                found himself compelled from the beginning to apply section 1 of
                                article 27 of the Constitution.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I believe that your idea will disappear, that such
                                legislation may contravene the understanding reached by the two
                                Governments through their commissioners before the resumption of
                                relations, since the spirit of this agreement was only one of mutual
                                respect for the rights of the two sovereign nations! but never of
                                setting aside the clear provisions of their respective
                                Constitutions.</p>

                        <p>274. Below is the substance of my conversation today with the Mexican
                            Ambassador. Unless you believe it to be inadvisable you are authorized
                            to use it as a basis of a conversation with the Mexican Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs:<note n="45" xml:id="d422fn45">Quotation which follows

                                    telegram No. 264, Nov. 25, to the Ambassador in Mexico, <ref

                                observations were made concerning the bill proposed to ‘regulate’
                                Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution. Señor Téllez stated that he
                                had not yet received a copy of this memorandum, but that he had had
                                a telegram from his Government stating that it was on the way.</p>
                            <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0630"/>
                            <p>The Secretary then read to Señor Téllez from Page 2 of the
                                    memorandum,<note n="48" xml:id="d422fn48">Reference is to the
                                    text as telegraphed by the Ambassador in his No. 269, Dee. 8, 10
                                    a.m.; not printed.</note> and remarked, in connection with the
                                implied criticism of the Secretary’s action in commenting upon
                                pending legislation in Mexico, that we had received at different
                                times representations from foreign governments in respect to pending
                                legislation in the United States, and that it seemed to him that the
                                time to make these comments was before the legislation should be
                                enacted, with a view to avoiding future friction. The Secretary
                                explained very fully to Señor Téllez that this Government had made
                                it most clear at all times that it did not wish to make any
                                observations on legislation in Mexico aimed solely at the future,
                                and had carefully restricted the scope of the observations made to
                                the features in the pending bills which seemed to have retroactive
                                effect and to affect vested rights duly acquired under previously
                                existing Mexican laws. He added that the letter and spirit of the
                                minutes of the discussions between the Mexican Commissioners and
                                Messrs. Warren and Payne should also always be borne in mind in this
                                connection.</p>
                            <p>Alluding to the implication in the reply from the Mexican Minister
                                for Foreign Affairs that these observations were preceded by press
                                publications which, although he was sure did not emanate officially
                                from the respective offices, certainly originated therein, the
                                Secretary stated that this was not true; that he had in accordance
                                with his own views and the agreement reached with the Minister for
                                Foreign Affairs, carefully refrained from any allusion to the matter
                                during his conversations with the press, and that no information had
                                been given out either by the members of the American Embassy in
                                Mexico or by the Department. Señor Téllez observed that some of the
                                American correspondents in Mexico City had sent despatches
                                concerning the bill, and it was intimated subsequently to Señor
                                Téllez that these correspondents had many sources of information in
                                Mexico and that the text of the bill was not difficult for them to
                                obtain.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary stated to the Ambassador that he did not desire to go
                                into a detailed discussion of the provisions of the Alien Land and
                                Petroleum laws; that he had examined with care the reply of the
                                Mexican Government and had examined the Petroleum Bill<note n="49"
                                    xml:id="d422fn49"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref
                                        target="#pg_531">p. 531</ref>.</note> and it seemed to him,
                                and it was the unanimous opinion of all American interests which had
                                made representations to the State Department, that these bills, if
                                they become laws, would divest vested rights legally acquired under
                                Mexican laws and he deplored the construction evidently placed upon
                                his recommendations, which were made only in a friendly spirit and
                                in consonance with his desire to protect duly vested American rights
                                and to avoid misunderstanding between the two countries. The
                                Secretary pointed out to the Ambassador that the two laws referred
                                to, the one of Arizona and the one of Illinois, were not retroactive
                                and did not divest previously vested rights of foreign citizens. The
                                Arizona law specifically provides that no person other than a
                                citizen of the United States, or who has declared his intention to
                                become such, and no corporation more than 30 percent of whose stock
                                is owned by persons other than citizens of the United States or who
                                have declared their intention to become <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549"
                                    facs="0631"/>such, shall hereafter acquire any land or title
                                thereto or interest therein other than mineral lands or such as may
                                be necessary for the actual working of mines and the products
                                thereof. The Arizona law also has a proviso that it shall not be
                                construed in any way to prevent or interfere with the ownership of
                                mining lands. The Illinois Statute does not in terms apply to lands
                                acquired previous to the passage of the law and has been so
                                construed by the Supreme Court of Illinois as not applying to
                                previously vested rights of aliens. This construction is binding
                                upon every court in the United States.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary went on to say that we have given many evidences of our
                                friendship to the present Government of Mexico; that the restriction
                                on the sale of arms have been removed from all Central American
                                countries except in one or two instances where we have treaty
                                requirements, but we continued to police the international border at
                                our expense and to maintain the embargo on arms to Mexico; that no
                                shipments of arms or explosives have been made to Mexico since the
                                embargo except upon express permit given by the Department of State
                                and with the approval of the Mexican Embassy in this capital; that
                                we had on several occasions attempted to restrict the activities of
                                persons in this country supposed to be furthering revolutionary or
                                subversive movements; that we have always refused, to receive
                                representatives of any Mexican revolutionary groups; that he has
                                purposely refused to receive any Mexican in order to avoid the risk
                                of finding himself confronted with some one representing a
                                revolutionary movement unless that Mexican were duly presented by
                                the Mexican Ambassador. The Secretary referred to … whom he had
                                refused to receive because he was informed that he was in league
                                with Mexicans in this country desiring to stir up a revolution.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary alluded to the growing impression among Americans
                                interested in Mexico that there was a general campaign of
                                legislation designed to deprive them of their rights, and concluded
                                by saying that he hoped that this was not true but that he desired
                                to have a frank talk with Señor Téllez on the subject.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary alluded to the labor bill pending in Mexico, but
                                observed that of course it was a matter of domestic policy, and that
                                we did not wish to make any official representations thereon, but
                                that American interests were very much concerned over its
                                possibilities.”</p>
                        </quote>
                        <p>Department is of the opinion that some provisions of the petroleum bill
                            are retroactive and destructive of the vested rights of Americans. After
                            reading reply of Foreign Minister I am convinced that criticisms of land
                            bill were justified. If you are of the opinion, after you have had
                            further conversations with the Foreign Minister, that the Department
                            should file a formal protest against the petroleum bill and should make
                            a further reply to Foreign Office note in answer to your November 27th,
                            I shall do so. Do not leave with Foreign Office a memorandum of my above
                            conversation since the Ambassador took no notes and his report may
                            differ from mine in detail. Reply at once as to whether Department
                            should make representations.</p>

                                n="50" xml:id="d423fn50">Latter not printed.</note> In an interview
                            at noon today with the Minister for Foreign Affairs I adhered closely to
                            the contents of your number 274. I spoke first upon the petroleum bill
                            and then upon the memorandum of December 5 concerning the bill to
                            regulate section 1 of article 27, the Arizona and Illinois statutes not
                            having a retroactive character, and finally impressed upon him the
                            numerous proofs of friendship the Mexican Government had received from
                            the United States, the continuance of the embargo on arms being
                            included. I only referred to articles 14 and 15 of the petroleum bill as
                            being contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Mexico as well
                            as the formal declaration of policy of the Mexican Government made to
                            Messrs. Warren and Payne in 1923. I also referred to the obvious
                            contradiction between the provision of the bill for the regulation of
                            section 1 of article 27, by which foreign corporations are forbidden to
                            acquire concessions in combustible minerals, and the provision of the
                            bill which requires that petition must be made for confirmation of
                            rights to the subsoil previously acquired.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs disclaimed special knowledge of matter
                            which, he said, was in the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry.
                            He stated that the Mexican Government did not admit that the bill was
                            retroactive and confiscatory, but that the regulation of the industry
                            for the benefit of all interests was absolutely necessary and that it
                            would eliminate the possibility of continued individual interpretation
                            of the law. I asked him whether he did not consider a law as
                            confiscatory and retroactive which limits the ownership of property
                            guaranteed by a decision of the Supreme Court as a vested right. He
                            stated that power to enact such law was vested in Congress and that such
                            law was analogous to the exercise of police power. The position of the
                            United States was reiterated several times by me that this project of
                            law and the bill for the regulation of section 1 of article 27 of the
                            Constitution were confiscatory and retroactive and that the views of the
                            United States Government were brought to the attention of the Mexican
                            Government while the bills were pending to prevent, if possible,
                            development of a situation by which the cordiality of the relations
                            between the two Governments might be adversely affected. In regard to
                            this he expressed appreciation of our friendly <pb n="551"
                                xml:id="pg_551" facs="0633"/>motive and he stated that the President
                            had authorized him to say that his Government fully reciprocated this
                            sentiment and that it was determined that nothing should be done which
                            might jeopardize the cordiality of the relations between the two
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Ambassador Téllez had
                            informed him that he had had a similar conversation with the Secretary
                            of State; and he wished me to advise you that, with regard to your
                            expression of anxiety to Téllez concerning the pending legislation, you
                            need not be disturbed, that the situation remained in <hi rend="italic"
                                >statu quo</hi>, that all denouncements of mining properties made by
                            individuals before 1917 would be respected, and that all those made
                            since then had been effected under the provisions of the Constitution of
                            1917 through permits granted to individuals upon petition.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized our desire to prevent the development of an unfavorable
                            situation by making representations concerning the pending legislation.
                            His attitude was conciliatory and he promised to call attention of the
                            appropriate authorities to today’s exchange of views.</p>
                        <p>It is probably too late for a formal note to affect the situation, as the
                            pending petroleum bill will probably be passed by the Senate today with
                            slight modifications.</p>
                        <p>That your conversation with Ambassador Téllez had produced good Results
                            here was evident from the Minister’s attitude, and the Mexican
                            Government seems to desire to avoid an issue at this time. I do not
                            believe that the two bills, the bill regulating section 1 of article 27
                            of the Constitution and the petroleum bill, can be made innocuous on
                            account of the pressure in Congress. It is my opinion that the Executive
                            branch of this Government seems to be disconcerted by our recent
                            representations.</p>
                        <p>There seems to be no need at this time to reply to the Mexican memorandum
                            of December 5, but if either of these bills becomes law, I believe that
                            a formal note should be presented promptly to prevent, if possible,
                            passing of the other bill.</p>

                                    following objections are not comprehensive, my Government
                                    desires me to point out that in its view: <list>

                                        <item>This law fails by far to give full recognition to
                                            rights lawfully acquired prior to the adoption of the
                                            present Mexican Constitution, when Mexican law expressly
                                            provided that the owner of surface lands owned also the
                                            subsoil deposits of petroleum.</item>

                                            it also fails to respect decisions of Supreme Court of
                                            Mexico in the interpretation of the very Constitutional
                                            provisions which the law is apparently designed to
                                            regulate, in that those decisions hold in effect that
                                            such Constitutional provisions are not retroactive as to

                                <p>My Government also directs me to invite Your Excellency’s
                                    attention to the provision in the laws under discussion
                                    requiring foreigners to waive their nationality and to agree not
                                    to invoke the protection of their respective governments so far
                                    as their property rights are concerned under penalty of
                                    forfeiture, and to inform Your Excellency that my Government has
                                    consistently declined to concede that such a waiver can annul
                                    the relation between an American citizen and his Government or
                                    that it can operate to extinguish the obligation of his

                                    justice.</p>
                                <p>In connection with the foregoing considerations, my Government
                                    further calls attention to the statements made by the Mexican
                                    Commissioners at the conference mentioned regarding the duty of
                                    the Federal executive power under the Constitution to respect
                                    and enforce the decisions of the judicial power, wherein,
                                    speaking as they stated for the Mexican Government, Mexican
                                    Commissioners said: “In accordance with such a duty, the
                                    Executive has respected and enforced, and will continue to do
                                    so, the principles of the decisions of the Supreme Court of
                                    Justice in the ‘Texas Oil Company’ case and the four other
                                    similar <hi rend="italic">Amparo</hi> cases, declaring that
                                    paragraph IV of Article 27 of the Constitution of 1917 is not
                                    retroactive in respect to all persons who have performed, prior
                                    to the promulgation of said Constitution, some positive act
                                    which would manifest the intention of the owner of the surface
                                    or of the persons entitled to exercise his rights to the oil
                                    under the surface to make use of or obtain the oil under the
                                    surface”.</p>
                                <p>Then enumerating a large number of positive acts the Mexican
                                    Commissioner added: “The above statement has constituted and
                                    will constitute in the future the policy of the Mexican
                                    Government, in respect to lands and the subsoil upon which or in
                                    relation to which any of the above specified acts have been
                                    performed, or in relation to which any of the above specified

                                <p>My Government is therefore unable to escape the conclusion that

                            instance of the Mexican Government, the Department agreed to instruct

                            work of the elimination of bancos suspended because of the differences

                            Lafleur, and together with this theory, her claim upon the Chamizal
                            tract.</p>
                        <p>The record shows that at the first trial of the Chamizal case before the
                            International Boundary Commission in 1894–1896, Mexico contended that
                            the Chamizal tract was formed as the result of an avulsive change and
                            that at the second trial of the case in 1911, Mexico contended for the
                            so-called fixed line theory, that is, that the boundary remained in the
                            thread of the channel of the Rio Grande as shown by the original surveys
                            of 1852. However, Mr. Lafleur, the presiding Commissioner at the second
                            trial, in his opinion and award found against both these contentions on
                            the part of the Mexican Government, and advanced the entire novel, and
                            in the opinion of the Department, the wholly unsound theory that
                            Articles 1 and 2 of the Boundary Convention of 1884 between the United
                            States and Mexico,<note n="63" xml:id="d426fn63">Malloy, <hi

                            not confined to changes brought about through “avulsion or erosion”, as
                            set forth in the last mentioned article, but that there is another kind
                            of change which might perhaps be called a change wrought by violent
                            erosion that is to be assimilated as to legal effects to an avulsive
                            change. The effect of the application of this theory of Commissioner
                            Lafleur would be to dissever the boundary line from the river to
                            substantially the same extent as the fixed line theory. It would
                            separate the boundary line from the river as it runs today <pb n="556"
                                xml:id="pg_556" facs="0638"/>throughout a distance of about eight
                            hundred miles, except at the point of intersection of the present
                            channel with the channel of 1852. The practical results of this theory
                            were admirably stated by General Anson Mills, the American Commissioner
                            of the International Boundary Commission, at the first trial of the
                            Chamizal case in 1896, when he was dealing with the then Mexican
                            contention that the erosive change which took place at the Chamizal
                            tract could be classified as an avulsive change. In the course of his
                            opinion General Mills said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the opinion of the United States Commissioner, if the change
                                    at El Chamizal has not been ‘slow and gradual’ by erosion and
                                    deposit within the meaning of Article I of the Treaty of 1884,
                                    there will never be such a one found in all the 800 miles, where
                                    the Rio Grande, with alluvial banks, constitutes the boundary,
                                    and the object of the treaty will be lost to both governments,
                                    as it will be meaningless and “useless, and the boundary will
                                    perforce be through all these 800 miles continuously that laid
                                    down in 1852, having literally no points in common with the
                                    present river, save in its many hundred intersections with the
                                    river, and to restore and establish this boundary will be the
                                    incessant work of large parties for years, entailing hundreds of
                                    thousands of dollars in expense to each government and uniformly
                                    dividing the lands between the nations and individual owners,
                                    that are now, under the supposition that for the past forty
                                    years, the changes have been gradual, and the river accepted
                                    generally as the boundary, under the same authority and
                                    ownership; for it must be remembered that the river in the
                                    alluvial lands, which constitute 800 miles, has nowhere to-day,
                                    the same location it had in 1852.” (Appendix to the United

                        <p>Therefore, if the Lafleur theory of “violent erosion” is to be applied by
                            the Boundary Commission, it would appear to be useless to begin the work
                            of the elimination of bancos. On the other hand, it would of course be
                            inconsistent and unjust for Mexico to claim the Chamizal tract if it be
                            conceded that the work of the Commission is to proceed upon the American
                            theory of “slow and gradual erosion” as opposed to “avulsion”, the
                            Lafleur theory of violent erosion being reserved solely for use in the
                            Chamizal case. The inconsistency of such contention on the part of
                            Mexico is clearly shown by the case of the Weber banco mentioned by the
                            American Commissioner in his letter of December 1, as one of the first
                            bancos requiring the attention of the Commission. This banco is but a
                            short distance from the Chamizal tract and is understood to have been
                            formed by the rapid erosion which shifted the channel of the Rio Grande
                            from its course in 1889 to its course in 1907. The river appears rapidly
                            to have eroded the American bank at that point and built up an accretion
                            on the south bank and then in 1911 to have made an avulsive change,
                            thereby throwing the accretion to the Weber tract to the north or left
                            bank of the Rio Grande and constituting a typical banco. If the <pb
                                n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0639"/>American theory of avulsion and
                            erosion is applied to this banco it will doubtless be held to the
                            Mexican territory and then eliminated to the United States. If on the
                            other hand the Lafleur theory of “violent erosion” be applied thereto,
                            the banco would probably be adjudicated wholly or at least in great part
                            to the United States in the first instance. In other words, if the
                            American theory of construction is applied in this case the banco will
                            be awarded to Mexico, thus preserving the Mexican private titles therein
                            and then eliminated to the United States, but if the Lafleur theory is
                            applied the banco will be held to be American territory and the Mexican
                            titles to this property will be voided. The application of the Lafleur
                            theory will apparently produce the immediate result in the case of this
                            banco of a great injustice to the private persons interested and the
                            ultimate result of confusion all along the boundary, while the
                            application of the American theory will result in the doing of justice
                            in the case of this banco. Nevertheless, it would be highly unjust for
                            Mexico to invoke sound principles of construction in order to obtain the
                            Weber banco while still clinging to her claim, based on precisely the
                            opposite theory, to the Chamizal tract in the immediate vicinity.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing it will be seen that a satisfactory adjustment
                            of the questions indicated should be arrived at before the elimination
                            of the bancos can well proceed, and the Department believes that the
                            time has arrived when such an adjustment can be reached. You will
                            observe that in his communication of December 1, 1923, the American
                            Commissioner states that the Mexican Commissioner is of the opinion that
                            “as far as our Boundary Commission is concerned the Chamizal zone case
                            is disposed of and is now placed before the two Governments for such
                            disposition as they may deem proper”. This expression on the part of the
                            Mexican Commissioner would seem only to go to the extent of saying that
                            the Chamizal case is disposed of as far as the Commission is concerned
                            without committing the Mexican Government itself, but the Department has
                            been informed by you in your letter of January 31, 1924,<note n="65"
                                xml:id="d426fn65">Not printed.</note> that during the course of your
                            informal discussions with the Mexican Commissioners during the summer of
                            1923 you brought the Chamizal case informally to the attention of one of
                            them and that he advised you, after consultation with the Foreign
                            Office, that the Mexican Government was disposed to abandon the
                            controversy and recognized the correctness of the view of the United
                            States that the award of Commissioner Lafleur could not be carried out.
                            You further stated that the Mexican Commissioner said that the matter
                            could be readily adjusted through the usual diplomatic channels when
                            relations were restored.</p>
                        <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0640"/>
                        <p>In view of the whole history of the Chamizal controversy culminating in
                            your informal discussions with the Mexican Commissioner, the Department
                            believes that the occasion offered by the present proposals of the
                            Mexican Boundary Commissioner for recommencing the surveys for the
                            elimination of the bancos should be improved in an endeavor to terminate
                            once and for all this longstanding and vexatious boundary question.</p>
                        <p>So far as the Chamizal case itself is concerned it could, of course, be
                            settled simply by the unconditional relinquishment by Mexico of her
                            claims on the tract, and it may be, in view of the attitude of the
                            Mexican authorities as it appeared in the conversation of the Mexican
                            Commissioner with you, that such an unconditional relinquishment can be
                            brought about. Therefore, the Department suggests that, in view of what
                            it believes to be the untenable character of Mexico’s claims to this
                            tract when viewed in the light of the history of the practical
                            construction placed upon the boundary treaties for many years, it is
                            proper for you to attempt to obtain an unconditional relinquishment of
                            the Mexican claims. It is suggested that this might well be done in your
                            discretion by taking up the matter in informal conversations with the
                            Foreign Office, referring to the proposals of the Mexican Boundary
                            Commissioner for the re-commencement of the surveys for the elimination
                            of the bancos and to your informal conversation with the Mexican
                            Commissioner in the summer of 1923 with regard to the Chamizal matter
                            and indicating that if, as the Department assumes from these
                            conversations, the Government of Mexico is no longer disposed to press
                            its claims to any portion of the Chamizal tract, there would seem to be
                            nothing to prevent the immediate resumption of surveys for the
                            elimination of the bancos so far as the appropriation available for the
                            American Commission now permits and that upon the receipt by you of a
                            note from the Foreign Office confirming the foregoing understanding
                            appropriate instructions in that case will be sent to the American
                            Boundary Commissioner.</p>
                        <p>However, if it appears to you as a result of your informal conversations
                            with the Foreign Office that such an unconditional abandonment of
                            Mexico’s claims to the Chamizal tract cannot be obtained, but that
                            Mexico is disposed now as in the past to insist upon some consideration
                            for this abandonment, you will inform the Foreign Office that while the
                            American Commissioner on the International Boundary Commission will be
                            instructed to make joint surveys in banco matters to the extent
                            permitted by the appropriation, the Department cannot instruct him to
                            attempt to decide banco cases with a view to the elimination of the
                            bancos concerned until the Chamizal case is disposed of and the
                            questions of treaty construction <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0641"
                            />connected therewith settled in such a manner as to allow the Boundary
                            Commission usefully to function in this respect. In these circumstances
                            the Department also desires you to take up at once the general
                            negotiations for the settlement of the Chamizal case and other boundary
                            questions near El Paso, Texas, at the precise point where they were
                            interrupted in 1913 and to present to the Mexican Government and
                            earnestly urge upon its consideration the draft convention which is
                            herewith enclosed. This draft convention was taken up substantially in
                            its present form by the Department in the spring of 1913 for
                            presentation to the Mexican Government in response to the memorandum

                        <p>It may be observed that the draft of the convention embodies the
                            fundamental ideas of the Mexican Embassy’s memorandum of January 27,
                            1913, together with the Department’s proposed modifications of March 3,
                            1913, and the Department believes that this convention offers not only a
                            just solution of the Chamizal case, but of the entire boundary question
                            at El Paso growing out of river changes at the so-called Cordova tract,
                            as well as at the Chamizal tract.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Chamizal tract itself it is very important to bear in
                            mind in discussing the convention that this Government took the firm and
                            unalterable position that the so-called Chamizal Award of 1911 was both
                            impossible of performance in fact and utterly void as a matter of law.
                            This position was taken by the American Commissioner and the American
                            Agent at the time the decision was rendered (Proceedings of the
                            International Boundary Commission for June 15, 1911, <ref
                                target="frus1911#pg_597"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                                1911, page 597</ref>) and was promptly ratified by the Department of
                            State in a memorandum to the Mexican Embassy of August 24, 1911 (<ref
                                target="frus1911#pg_604"><hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>

                            the President of the United States in his Annual Message of December 7,
                            1911 (<ref target="frus1911#pg_XI"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                            admits of no discussion so far as this Government is concerned. It will
                            be observed that the before-mentioned Mexican memorandum of January 27,
                            1913 frankly provides in its first proposition for the adherence of both
                            Governments “to the attitudes they have respectively taken on the matter
                            and to the scope given by each to the final award”. This fundamental
                            concept is scrupulously followed <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0642"
                            />in the proposed convention and it is of the utmost practical
                            importance that it should be followed, since if this Government even for
                            an instant admitted the validity of the Lafleur Award of 1911, although
                            Mexico in the next instant ceded the Chamizal tract to the United
                            States, the result might be to cast doubt upon the private American
                            titles to the lands in the tract upon which thousands of people make
                            their homes and which are now understood to be worthy, with the
                            improvements which have been placed thereon, many millions of
                            dollars.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the extinguishment of Mexican claims on the Chamizal tract
                            provided for in the convention, another point of large importance to the
                            continued growth and development of the City of El Paso is the provision
                            therein contained for drawing the boundary line so as to throw the
                            so-called Cordova tract into the jurisdiction of the United States. This
                            tract, although upon the American side of the river as it runs today and
                            immediately adjoining the City of El Paso, is, in accordance with the
                            principles of treaty construction which the United States has always
                            maintained, unquestionably Mexican territory.</p>
                        <p>The Department is informed that the Cordova lands, owing to their
                            geographical position, have become an ideal base of operation for
                            persons engaged in the smuggling of liquor, narcotics, and aliens into
                            the United States, and the resulting situation constitutes a nuisance to
                            both Governments and a menace to the peace and good order of the border
                            cities of El Paso and Juarez as has been clearly demonstrated by
                            unpleasant incidents which have occurred at that point.</p>
                        <p>Aside from remedying this situation by making the river as it runs the
                            boundary between El Paso and Juarez, the inclusion of the Cordova lands
                            within the United States would also make it possible, if it should be
                            found to be desirable, to bring the railroads into El Paso along the
                            river bank instead of through the center of the city as at present, and
                            without expressing any opinion as to the desirability of this change,
                            which is for the consideration of the citizens of El Paso, it would
                            unquestionably be advantageous if this question could be determined upon
                            its technical and economic merits without reference to the situation of
                            the international boundary line.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons the Department regards the bringing of the Cordova
                            lands into the United States as of great public utility and one of the
                            principal inducements for agreeing to a convention following the general
                            lines proposed by Mexico in 1913 and including compensation under
                            certain conditions and in a limited amount for the Mexican private
                            titles in the Chamizal tract, the validity of which the Department has
                            always denied. There is enclosed a memorandum<note n="66"
                                xml:id="d426fn66">Not printed.</note>
                            <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0643"/>as to the area and value of the
                            lands transferred or relinquished under the proposed draft of a boundary
                            convention. This memorandum was prepared in 1913 at the same time as the
                            proposed convention, but it is believed that any changes in value which
                            may have taken place since that time are of no particular consequence
                            inasmuch as the Mexican negotiators have always disclaimed the idea of
                            accepting money in return for sovereignty, and the negotiations have
                            proceeded upon the basis of an exchange of a substantially equal amount
                            of acreage which is to be for the mutual benefit of both countries as in
                            the case of the elimination of the bancos, in addition to any
                            compensation which may be equitably due on account of private titles. As
                            is pointed out in the enclosed memorandum as to the area and value of
                            the land, there is no compensation due under this head unless it be in
                            the case of the disputed Mexican titles in the Chamizal tract, and the
                            compensation should be made for these, if at all, only as proposed in
                            the convention, that is, in an amount not to exceed the assessed
                            valuation of the lands without improvements at the date of the Chamizal
                            Award. Any subsequent increase in the value of the lands in the Chamizal
                            tract is, therefore, immaterial.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the maps referred to in the draft convention it may be
                            said that these maps were taken by Mr. Summerlin<note n="67"
                                xml:id="d426fn67">George T. Summerlin, Counselor of the Embassy in
                                Mexico.</note> with the copy of a draft convention on the Chamizal
                            matter which he brought to Mexico from the Department in May, 1921.
                            Reference is made to this by Mr. Summerlin in his letter to Mr. Hanna of
                            September 29, 1923,<note n="68" xml:id="d426fn68">Not printed; Matthew
                                E. Hanna was Chief of the Division of Mexican Affairs.</note> and it
                            is presumed that these maps are still in the Embassy’s possession.
                            Should this not prove to be the case, the Department upon being so
                            informed will forward other maps.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the memorandum of area and value which is enclosed it may
                            be observed that the Department’s information indicates that there may
                            have been a considerable diminution of the thirty acre tract near El
                            Paso, south of the artificial cutoff referred to in paragraph la of that
                            memorandum and it may be in view of the constant erosion which has taken
                            place at that point that little, if any, of this tract still remains. An
                            official joint survey would be required to ascertain the fact in this
                            respect but if any of the tract is still in existence convenience
                            clearly calls for its transference to Mexican sovereignty and even if
                            the tract has wholly disappeared through the shifting of the river to
                            the south at this point so as to entirely destroy the tract and pass it
                            under the river to the American side no harm can be done by establishing
                            formally and definitively <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0644"/>in
                            the treaty that the running river is the boundary line at this point.
                            Moreover the tract is so insignificant in area and of so little
                            comparative value that its disappearance in whole or in part would seem
                            to have no material bearing upon the question of the fairness of the
                            territorial exchange offered to Mexico, since the area of the Horcon Bar
                            which it is proposed to transfer to Mexico is about one-third greater
                            than the area of the Cordova tract which it is proposed to transfer to
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the Department would point out that the negotiations for the
                            disposition of this boundary matter have been pending for a number of
                            years and have more than once failed of conclusion when apparently on
                            the point of successful consummation by reason of events having no
                            relation to the merits of the questions under consideration, such as the
                            overthrow of the Madero Government in 1913.<note n="69"

                                ff.</note> Therefore, the Department regards it as of great
                            importance that the present favorable opportunity arising from the
                            recently renewed and very friendly relations between the two governments
                            taken in connection with your own cordial personal relations with the
                            Mexican authorities should be taken advantage of for bringing these
                            negotiations to a successful conclusion with the least possible delay.
                            The Department deems it particularly desirable that if practicable these
                            negotiations be concluded before the opening of the sessions of the
                            General Claims Commission to be constituted under the convention
                            recently entered into with Mexico.</p>
                        <p>For your convenient reference with respect to the entire history of the
                            Chamizal controversy the Department encloses a copy of a memorandum on
                            the Chamizal negotiations prepared by Mr. William C. Dennis,<note n="70"

                                mentioned, and by way of compromise, as well as in view of the fact

                                the date of the decision of June 15, 1911, of the International
                                Boundary Commission in the Chamizal case must be considered as being
                                under a valid title, and whereas the Government of the United States
                                of America on the other hand does not acknowledge the validity of

                                to dispose of this question, and without giving any force or effect
                                to the said decision, agree by way of compromise as follows:</p>
                            <p>A commission to be established by the two governments, and composed

                                Mexican States, and a third by the two so appointed, shall examine
                                these alleged Mexican private titles from the standpoint of Mexican
                                law for the purpose of determining which if any of these titles
                                would be valid under Mexican law if the Chamizal tract were assumed
                                to be Mexican territory.</p>
                            <p>This commission shall meet at El Paso as soon as possible after the

                                the first meeting of the Commission.</p>
                            <p>Each Government shall pay the expenses of the commissioner appointed
                                by it, and all other expenses of the Commission, including the
                                compensation of the third member, shall be borne by the two
                                Governments in equal moieties.</p>

                                by such private title and shall appraise the value of all land so
                                located at an amount not in excess of the appraised value thereof as
                                fixed by the tax assessors in El Paso at the date of the decision of
                                the International Boundary Commission in the Chamizal case of June

                                description which may be found thereon except those if any made by
                                claimants under Mexican private title prior to the date of the said

                                Government of the United Mexican States of the sums awarded by the

                            correspondence concerning the desired settlement of the longstanding
                            Chamizal case and particularly to its instruction No. 68 of May 9, 1924,
                            in which the Embassy was directed to endeavor to bring about an
                            adjustment of this matter either through an unconditional relinquishment
                            by Mexico of her claims on the tract, or if this could not be brought
                            about, by the conclusion of a convention providing for an adjustment of
                            this difficulty, as well as for bringing the so-called Cordova tract
                            into the jurisdiction of the United States. The Department also refers
                            to its instruction No. 136 of June 28, 1924,<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d427fn72">Not printed.</note> wherein the Embassy was
                            requested to express an opinion as to the advisability of taking up at
                            the same time with the general negotiations regarding the Chamizal case
                            the questions of the construction of a controlling river channel in the
                            Rio Grande and the fixing of the international boundary line in the
                            center of that channel, and to the Embassy’s reply, No. 8708, of July
                            29, 1924,<note n="72" xml:id="d427fn74">Not printed.</note> in which the
                            opinion was expressed that so far from hindering the satisfactory
                            development of the negotiations in the Chamizal case, the suggestions
                            regarding the construction of a controlling river channel and the fixing
                            of the international boundary line in the center of that channel would
                            facilitate a settlement of the Chamizal controversy by reason of the
                            additional guarantee such channel works would offer of the permanency of
                            the boundary.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that the time is now opportune to endeavor to
                            arrange with the Mexican Government for the conclusion of a convention
                            dealing with all of the questions mentioned and therefore encloses
                            copies of draft articles to be inserted in the draft convention enclosed
                            with the Department’s instruction of May 9, 1924. The articles now
                            enclosed would precede the final article VI as set forth in that draft
                            convention and be numbered, respectively, VI, VII and VIII, leaving the
                            final article in the convention as set forth in the draft mentioned to
                            be numbered Article IX.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that the Embassy shall use its best efforts to
                            bring the negotiations for the conclusion of this convention to a
                            successful termination at the earliest possible date and considers that
                                <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0649"/>it is highly desirable that
                            this be brought about prior to the sessions of the General Claims

                            <p>Whereas, the International Boundary Commission has recommended to the
                                Governments of the United States and Mexico that the artificial
                                cut-offs marked A–B, C–D, and E–F, on a map hereto annexed (Map

                                made for the protection of both banks of the El Paso Valley against
                                floods, and the two Governments have respectively approved this
                                recommendation, the High Contracting Parties agree that after said
                                cut-offs have been made, the International Boundary Line shall
                                follow the center of the normal channel of the Rio Grande as it runs
                                through said artificial cut-offs as shown on said map. This boundary
                                line is understood to be arcefinious and is substantially as shown

                                artificially separated and eliminated shall exceed 250 hectares in

                        <p>48. The Counselor of Embassy and I discussed the Chamizal case with the
                            Foreign Minister today. I pointed out that the principles which governed
                            the operations of the International Boundary Commission respecting the
                            elimination of bancos in the Rio Grande River were not clear enough to
                            enable that Commission to function in accordance with the suggestion of
                            the Mexican Commissioner until the attitude of the Mexican Government
                            towards relinquishment of its claim to the Chamizal tract and its views
                            on matters of treaty construction pertaining thereto were defined. The
                            Foreign Minister said that his Government did not relinquish its claim
                            on two grounds: (1) the arbitration of 1911 was in favor of Mexico; (2)
                            the Government of the United States by its representations through me
                            gave evidence that it considered the matter a controversial one.
                            However, the Foreign Minister assured me that his Government was very
                            anxious to receive suggestions from us looking towards a settlement of
                            this controversy which was long standing and which Mexico had not taken
                            up in the first instance because of the award in 1911 favorable to
                            Mexico, the revolutionary period in Mexico, and the subsequent
                            nonrecognition of Mexico by us. Relations were now cordial and friendly,
                            he said, and he thought the time was most propitious for undertaking the
                            negotiations. He promised that when I submitted the Department’s
                            proposals he would immediately expedite their consideration with a view
                            to effecting an early settlement of the controversy.</p>
                        <p>In view of this I am sending a formal note to the Foreign Minister with a
                            copy of the draft convention including the articles which relate to the
                            construction of a controlled river channel.</p>
                        <p>I am assured that his Government also desires to conclude the convention
                            as quickly as possible because of the effect here and abroad. I shall
                            press the negotiations earnestly.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: I have the honor to refer
                                to Your Excellency’s courteous note No. 306 of February 19, last, in
                                which incidentally there is discussed the matter of the Chamizal and
                                principally the fixing of the international boundary line in the
                                vicinity of the City of El Paso.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency first states that although the Government of the
                                United States will instruct the American Commissioner on the
                                International Boundary Commission to carry out, together with the
                                Mexican Commissioner, the surveys of the bancos which the latter
                                suggested, it cannot, however, instruct him to decide pending cases
                                and eliminate the bancos concerned until the Chamizal case has been
                                disposed of and the treaty construction connected therewith settled
                                in such a manner as to allow the Commission usefully to function in
                                this respect. With respect to this, I on my part state to Your
                                Excellency that the Mexican Government believes that the Chamizal
                                case and the case of the elimination of the newly formed bancos are
                                distinct matters and, therefore, must be treated separately. It
                                likewise believes that the action postponing the elimination of
                                these bancos signifies on the part of the Government of the United
                                States a disregard, or at least an unacceptable suspension of
                                conventions fully in force and regarding the application and
                                interpretation of which there is not the least doubt. Therefore, my
                                Government desires that the Commission commence immediately the
                                necessary work for <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0652"/>the
                                elimination of the bancos, which would be to the advantage of both
                                countries.</p>
                            <p>With particular reference to the Chamizal case, Your Excellency
                                states that upon the understanding that the Mexican Government is
                                not disposed unconditionally to abandon its claim in the Chamizal
                                case, the American Government proposes an agreement, a draft of
                                which you enclose and which, principally, as I said above, has for
                                its object the rectification of the boundary between both countries
                                in the vicinity of El Paso.</p>
                            <p>Mexico certainly cannot abandon its rights to a territory which it
                                believes was fundamentally its from the beginning, and which was
                                awarded to it in part by an arbitral decision which it considers
                                perfectly valid; but, nevertheless, as it has already stated on
                                several occasions to the Government of the United States, it has the
                                highest desire to reach a practical solution in this case, provided
                                one can be reached on the basis of equity which will not injure
                                Mexican sovereignty in any way.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency states that you have received instructions to renew
                                the negotiations for such a solution, taking them up at the point
                                where they were interrupted in the year 1913, and upon this
                                understanding you present the draft convention mentioned above.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency calls attention to the fact that this draft embodies
                                the fundamental ideas of the memorandum, which, it is said, was
                                presented by the Mexican Embassy at Washington to the Department of
                                State on January 27, 1913, but adds that these fundamental ideas are
                                modified in accordance with what was proposed by the Department on
                                the 3rd day of March of the same year 1913. In this connection I
                                must make clear to Your Excellency that the Mexican Embassy at
                                Washington did not formally present to the Department of State any
                                memorandum dated January 27, 1913. Your Excellency cannot be unaware
                                that about the end of the year 1912 the then Ambassador of Mexico,
                                Señor Don Manuel Calero, had conversations on this subject with the
                                Department of State and especially with the Secretary of State, Mr.
                                Knox, and with the Counselor, Mr. Chandler Anderson, with the result
                                that Mr. Anderson agreed to submit to the Ambassador certain
                                propositions upon which the terms of the agreement would be worked
                                out. At the end of the same year of 1912 Señor Calero left the
                                United States to return to Mexico, and during those same days the
                                then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Señor Lie. Don Pedro Lascuráin,
                                availing himself of his trip to New York, went to Washington where
                                he conferred witht Mr. Knox regarding the Chamizal. Nothing definite
                                came of this beyond a promise by Señor Lascuráin (who was ignorant,
                                as he repeatedly declared, of the details of the conferences which
                                Señor Calero had with the Department <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571"
                                    facs="0653"/>of State) to present a proposition for the
                                settlement of the matter. On his return to Mexico Señor Lascuráin
                                familiarized himself in detail with the negotiations which had been
                                carried on, and, as a result he instructed the Mexican Chargé
                                d’Affaires, Señor Lie. Arturo de la Cueva, to speak personally with
                                Mr. Knox regarding the propositions which Mr. Anderson was to submit
                                as above mentioned. Señor de la Cueva in compliance with his
                                instructions, sought an appointment with Mr. Knox to deliver to him
                                a memorandum on the matter. He did not speak with Mr. Knox, but with
                                the Counselor, Mr. Anderson, who told him that in order that the
                                conference with Mr. Knox might be successful he must inform him (Mr.
                                Anderson) in advance how he desired to treat the Chamizal matter.
                                Señor de la Cueva replied that he had a memorandum to present to Mr.
                                Knox and that he would not deliver it except to Mr. Knox personally;
                                but as he had with him a paper on which he had written certain
                                propositions regarding which Mr. Knox and he were to converse, he
                                was going to read it to him (Mr. Anderson), which he did. He finally
                                left this paper with Mr. Anderson who agreed to speak with Mr. Knox
                                and to make a formal appointment for him in order that he might
                                comply with the instructions of the Mexican Government. The
                                conference with Mr. Knox did not take place, because Señor de la
                                Cueva left Washington and because, as Your Excellency knows, during
                                the first days of February 1913, the anti-Madero revolution broke
                                out.</p>
                            <p>The paper which Señor de la Cueva informally delivered to Mr.
                                Anderson, contained only the propositions which Mr. Anderson had
                                agreed to submit to Señor Calero for their discussion, as above
                                stated, and, therefore, it cannot be considered either as an
                                official document of the Mexican Embassy or, much less, as implying
                                that Mexico was in agreement with the propositions emanating from
                                the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>It is probably to this paper or document that Your Excellency refers
                                in alluding to the memorandum presented on January 27, 1913, by the
                                Mexican Embassy, proposing that the negotiations be renewed from
                                that point with the modifications which were proposed by the United
                                States on March 3, 1913. Mexico cannot, in spite of its great desire
                                to end the Chamizal case, renew the negotiations from that point,
                                since it cannot consider as accepted the propositions made in the
                                document informally delivered by Señor de la Cueva and which was
                                published by the Government of the United States in the volume
                                entitled <ref target="frus1913#pg_971"><hi rend="italic">Foreign
                                        Relations of the United States</hi>, 1913, on page
                                971</ref>, which publication was made without the consent of the
                                Mexican Government. Neither can Mexico take into account the
                                propositions made by the Department of State on March 3, 1913, to a
                                spurious government and one which was never recognized by the United
                                States itself.</p>
                            <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0654"/>
                            <p>Therefore, Mexico would propose in the highest spirit of friendship
                                for the United States that the negotiations be renewed from a date
                                prior to January 27, 1913, and, more precisely, from the point where
                                Mr. Chandler Anderson agreed to submit to the Mexican Ambassador a
                                proposition as a basis for discussion.</p>
                            <p>Since the present nature of the relations of Mexico with the United
                                States is that of a perfect understanding and that of a friendship
                                which does not exclude but rather demands absolute frankness on the
                                part of the two Governments, I consider myself obliged to notify
                                Your Excellency in advance that the Mexican Government would not be
                                disposed to consider any proposal which contained the first
                                proposition which is made in the document published by the American
                                Government in its volume <ref target="frus1913#pg_971"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>,
                                    1913, page 971</ref>, where it is printed erroneously as an
                                official Mexican document. In fact, Mexico has believed and
                                continues to believe that the award of the arbitral tribunal in the
                                Chamizal case is perfectly valid and binding on both Governments.
                                The well-founded claims which Mexico had to a part of the Chamizal
                                prior to the award were strengthened by the terms of the award, and
                                it does not see why it should abandon the advantageous position
                                given it by this award when to abandon it would have so disastrous
                                an effect upon Mexican public opinion and make it impossible to
                                carry out any arrangement of a practical nature for settling the
                                question.</p>
                            <p>My Government desires at once to assure Your Excellency’s Government
                                that Mexico, although it gives every validity to the award, is
                                disposed to enter into an agreement because it understands that the
                                carrying out of the award would be materially impracticable, or at
                                least very difficult, because it would perhaps be necessary, in
                                order to fix the line followed by the Rio Grande in 1869, to destroy
                                the very thing claimed, which is part of the City of El Paso built
                                upon the land of the Chamizal. But aside from this, and inasmuch as
                                the two Governments wish to reach a practical solution of the
                                question and one which will remove the Chamizal case from the realm
                                of controversy, my Government insists that the best beginning would
                                be not to touch upon principles but to seek a practical arrangement.
                                Let me explain:</p>
                            <p>The Government of the United States cannot be unaware that the
                                difficulty on the part of Mexico definitely to settle this matter of
                                the Chamizal, notwithstanding the many years it has been discussed,
                                is that it deals with a portion of our territory, and affects our
                                national sovereignty. Mexican public opinion has always been very
                                jealous with respect to this, and it can scarcely be expected that
                                by conducting a campaign to enlighten it and demonstrating that that
                                sovereignty is not at all affected, that an arrangement could be <pb
                                    n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0655"/>reached whereby the two
                                nations renounce the same rights and exchange identical things. This
                                difficulty of controlling public opinion is accentuated all the
                                more, since the rights of Mexico have been confirmed by an
                                arbitration legal in every way.</p>
                            <p>From the foregoing statement Your Excellency’s Government will
                                understand that this question cannot be settled by denying the
                                validity of the award; and in reality a statement in a convention
                                reciting that each of the High Contracting Parties persists in its
                                attitude as to the validity of the arbitral award would mean nothing
                                else, for after all even though Mexico should state that the award
                                is valid, it would not be carried out, and thus the point of view of
                                the United States would prevail.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the fact that the recognition of the validity of the
                                award would make it possible for the two Governments to enter into a
                                practical arrangement in the matter, such a course would have the
                                advantage, not to be depreciated, of affirming throughout the world,
                                and especially in America, confidence in arbitration. My Government
                                does not pretend, of course, to judge what is, or is not, convenient
                                for the United States; but it ventures to presume that the position
                                of this great nation in the world, with regard to peaceful solution
                                of international conflicts, would be rendered preeminent by
                                respecting the award and that, on the contrary, the nonacceptance of
                                it would lessen confidence in the nation which has been such a
                                constant and effective champion of arbitral procedure.</p>
                            <p>For these reasons my Government cannot enter into a consideration of
                                the draft convention which was submitted to it by the Department of
                                State through Your Excellency, since it is necessary to reach an
                                agreement on the essential points of the draft before entering upon
                                an examination of the details.</p>
                            <p>If the foregoing views should not be acceptable—a situation which
                                Mexico does not expect in view of the good relations it maintains
                                with the United States and the good faith of Your Excellency’s
                                Government—I would call Your Excellency’s attention to the
                                following:</p>
                            <p>The controversy between Mexico and the United States over the
                                Chamizal has changed. Now the question to be decided is whether the
                                award is valid, as Mexico maintains, or is null, as the United
                                States maintains. Since the United States maintains that it is null
                                and presents a draft convention regarding the boundary, which Mexico
                                must reject, the United States does not surrender any of the rights
                                it believes it possesses. On the other hand, if Mexico accepted the
                                said convention, it would surrender all its rights to the Chamizal,
                                would admit that it had maintained them without cause and would
                                leave the award without effect thereby inexplicably changing its
                                attitude.</p>
                            <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0656"/>
                            <p>When an arbitral award can be challenged on any of the known grounds
                                determined by international law, the recourse is for the interested
                                governments to submit the award to a court of review created <hi
                                    rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>. In order, therefore, to settle the
                                present difficulty, as stated—supposing that the foregoing views are
                                not acceptable—Mexico makes the following proposition: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>That Mexico and the United States designate the Hague

                                        award, whether the award is valid or not.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>If the Hague Tribunal should decide that the award is

                            meeting held at the offices of the Mexican Section, Juarez, Chih., at
                            ten A.M., June 23, 1925, for the purpose of taking final action on the
                            petition of the City and County of El Paso, Texas, presented through
                            their attorney, Major Richard F. Burges.</p>
                        <p>After a careful review of the report of Engineers L. M. Lawson,
                            representing the United States and Salvador Arroyo, representing the
                            Republic of Mexico, together with the report of the Consulting Engineers
                            of this Commission, it was decided that these proposed cuts in the Rio
                            Grande which extend from the cities of Juarez, Mexico and El Paso,
                            Texas, for about eight miles down the river will have the effect of
                            protecting the cities of El Paso and Juarez and valuable farming land
                            from flood menace.</p>
                        <p>The plans of the engineers representing the two Governments, in which our
                            Commission heartily concurs in provides for a continuation of the work
                            of straightening the river, building levees, et cetera, through the
                            entire El Paso valley, which on the American side is composed of the
                            counties of El Paso and Hudspeth, and on the south side, the
                            municipalities of Juarez, Guadalupe, Porvenir and San Ignacio.</p>
                        <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0657"/>
                        <p>The expenses incurred in this work on the American side will be paid by
                            the city and county of El Paso, and on the Mexican side by agencies of
                            the Federal Government as their local municipalities are unable to bear
                            the burden incurred by the proposed river cuts and levee system.</p>
                        <p>The Consulting Engineers of our Commission state that the bed of the Rio
                            Grande has risen so high that unless there is some immediate measures
                            taken there is great danger of a disastrous flood which will do great
                            damage to a part of the cities of El Paso and Juarez and to the farmers
                            below the two cities.</p>
                        <p>In view of all the circumstances I earnestly request that you approve our
                            recommendations authorizing the proposed cuts in the Rio Grande, with
                            the understanding that the expenses incurred so far as the United States
                            is concerned will be paid by the city and county of El Paso, and that
                            the proposed cuts shall be made under the supervision of our Commission
                            through our respective Consulting Engineers.</p>

                                serious consequences might be expected from performing works

                                execution, how the corresponding expenditures will be made, and the
                                resulting works maintained. Recommendations are hereby made to both

                                the United States resolve otherwise. Attention of the Department of

                        <p>176. By Minute No. 61, recently adopted, the International Boundary
                            Commission, United States and Mexico, recommended three cut-offs in the
                            Rio Grande in and near El Paso, the result of which, if made, would,
                            according to the accompanying reports of consulting engineers on the
                            Commission, obviate the danger of floods in that section and in a
                            considerable section below.</p>
                        <p>Since the adoption of that minute, a flood has occurred and is understood
                            to be raging now, which has already caused much property loss on both
                            sides of the River. Consequently, the recommendations would appear to
                            merit immediate consideration with a view to their approval by both
                            Governments, unless insuperable obstacles exist concerning which this
                            Government is not informed.</p>
                        <p>The Department is advised that the proposed cut-offs would segregate but
                            very small areas of land and believes that the question of sovereignty
                            over these areas could well be held in abeyance for the present in view
                            of the large interests which are menaced by floods.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore desired that you bring this matter urgently to the
                            attention of the Mexican Government and say that it is hoped that
                            Government will see its way clear to making a prompt decision in favor
                            of approving the Commission’s recommendations.</p>

                        <p>154. I personally delivered to Minister of Foreign Affairs last evening
                            note in sense of your telegram 176 August 11, 3 p.m. He said that
                            Mexican members International Boundary Commission had already reported
                            recent minute regarding construction of cut-offs but that Mexican
                            Government had been unable to approve proposal because of pendency of
                            Chamizal negotiations involving similar questions and because of
                            existing embarrassments in exercising Mexican sovereignty in Cordova
                            tract which was in a situation similar to that which would prevail upon
                            completion of proposed cut-offs. I asked the Minister to reconsider the
                            matter with practical regard to property damage done by floods leaving
                            theoretical questions for the future, but he seemed insistent that
                            proposed cut-offs must await settlement of general Rio Grande problem.
                            He promised however to take my note under earnest advisement and to
                            reply as soon as possible.</p>

                                refer to the Embassy’s note No. 720 of the 12th instant in which, by
                                instruction of your Government, you were good enough to inform me
                                that by Minute No. 61 our International Boundary Commission
                                recommended the construction of three cut-offs in the Rio Grande
                                near the City of El Paso, Texas, the result of which would be
                                according to the accompanying report of the consulting engineers on
                                the International Boundary Commission, as stated in the note, to
                                obviate the danger of floods in that section and in another
                                considerably below the point mentioned.</p>
                            <p>The recommendations contained in Minute No. 61 were duly studied as
                                provided by article 8 of the convention of March 1, 1889, and within
                                one month, as stipulated in article 8, our decision in the matter
                                was drawn up and sent to our Embassy in Washington for transmission
                                to the Department of State.</p>
                            <p>In this decision, which decision must already be known by the
                                Department of State, according to instructions to our Ambassador in

                                        recommended at the same time that the cases of bancos in
                                        this zone of the Rio Grande should be presented to the Joint

                                        not be given to making any cut-off unless at the same time
                                        and before the work is carried out there be settled the

                                    <item>That the cut-offs in question were recently proposed by
                                        the Government of the United States in a draft convention

                                        in its note of February 19, last. This draft convention was
                                        rejected in its totality by the Mexican Government and it
                                        could therefore not now consent that a part thereof should
                                        be carried out.</item>

                                    <item>The Government of the United States has desired to connect
                                        the cases above referred to with the pending Chamizal case
                                        and in its turn Mexico does not want to create new
                                        difficulties until that relative to the Chamizal is
                                        settled.</item>

                            <p>As you will see, it was only the desire to avoid the creation of new
                                difficulties before the settlement of pending cases and the reaching
                                of an agreement by the two Governments in the matter which was the
                                motive for postponing the carrying out of the recommendations of the
                                International Boundary Commission contained in Minute No. 61, to the
                                end that, after the question of the interpretation of the treaties
                                which the said cases involve [apparent omission], without failing to
                                recognize the advisability of carrying out all the proposed
                                works.</p>
                            <p>Before reaching the decision mentioned, based on the reasons set
                                forth, the urgency which might exist in immediately undertaking the
                                proposed cut-offs was taken into consideration, and the reports of
                                the engineers charged with the project and of the consulting
                                engineers of the International Boundary Commission were carefully
                                studied, and from that point of view it was found that in the
                                unanimous opinion of all of them the cut-offs proposed and
                                recommended by the International Boundary Commission in Minute No.

                                relative to the matter, anything more than the “first stage” in the
                                general project, the construction of which is to be recommended in
                                view of the fact that the modifications of relatively slight
                                importance which they would produce in the hydraulic equilibrium of
                                the river permit their initiation in the upper region of the valley
                                and not in the lower as would be logically convenient; and it was
                                found that considering the higher value of property in the
                                neighborhood of the cities of El Paso and Juárez and in view of
                                certain considerations of a financial character which make it
                                possible to perform the work immediately, their construction is
                                recommended without, however, it failing to be indispensable to
                                continue the construction of the works in the whole valley.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing views and the technical development of the project
                                having been studied, it is easy to arrive at the conviction that,
                                what <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0663"/>in the opinion of the
                                experts will settle the problem of saving the lands in the valley of
                                El Paso from floods, will be the completion of the project in its
                                entirety and not that of its “first stage”; that if for financial or
                                other reasons it is not possible immediately to carry out the
                                project in its entirety or in the form in which it would be
                                logically convenient to do so, whereby in the opinion of the
                                technical experts the danger would be averted, the construction of
                                the first part proposed for the benefit of those interested in the
                                first portion could be recommended; but if the project is studied
                                even more in detail and attention is paid to the fact that in order
                                to carry it out it is essential to construct levees provided with
                                rip-raps and with structures forming the artificial channel for the
                                maximum discharge of floods and the fact that the probable floods at
                                this season will surely render difficult, if they do not entirely
                                prevent, the construction of these structures, especially in the
                                detail recommended by the consulting engineers, one will arrive at
                                the conviction that the construction ought to be commenced after the
                                present flood season and that, consequently, there is no reason to
                                hasten it in disregard of considerations of real importance which
                                would tend to postpone it.</p>
                            <p>I hope that the Government of the United States of America will be
                                good enough to appreciate the true importance and value of the
                                reasons on which was based the decision relative to this matter and
                                will agree to the justice which supports it.</p>
                            <p>It is very satisfactory to me to renew to you the assurances of my
                                most courteous consideration.</p>

                        <p>Officials of El Paso and Juarez are reported to be anxious that
                            rectification of Rio Grande be commenced as soon as possible, because
                            they fear next flood season will be even more disastrous than last one
                            to residents on both sides of River. American Boundary Commissioner
                            reports that general opinion prevails along border that recent flood
                            damage exceeding half-million dollars could have been prevented if River
                            had been straightened as proposed in Minute 61. Commissioner further
                            states that if rectification should be undertaken, interests of
                            respective Governments could be adequately safeguarded by <pb n="582"

                                to Your Excellency’s courteous note No. 867, of October 27, last, in
                                which, referring to the recommendations of the International
                                Boundary Commission contained in Minute No. 61 regarding the
                                construction of certain cut-offs in the channel of the Rio Grande,
                                near the City of El Paso, Texas, you state that the officials on
                                both sides desire that the proposed work be <pb n="583"
                                    xml:id="pg_583" facs="0665"/>commenced as soon as possible, in
                                order to avoid the danger of inundation in the next flood
                                season.</p>
                            <p>Your Excellency states that your Government knows from a report of
                                the American Boundary Commissioner that the opinion prevails pretty
                                generally along the border that the damage occasioned by the last
                                flood might have been avoided if the channel had been straightened
                                in accordance with recommendations contained in Minute No. 61 and
                                that the said Commissioner also was of the opinion that the works in
                                question could be undertaken while safeguarding the rights of both
                                countries through the adoption of adequate precaution by the
                                International Boundary Commission.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the efficacy of the proposed works in order to avoid
                                floods, I must inform Your Excellency, insisting upon what was
                                stated in my note of August 18, last, regarding this same matter,
                                that it is the unanimous opinion, both of the experts who planned
                                the works as well as of those charged with passing judgment on the
                                project: (1) that what will avoid the risk of floods will be the
                                construction of works throughout the whole extension of the El Paso
                                valley and not in one isolated section; (2) that these works, in
                                order that they may have an assured result and not produce,
                                down-stream, greater evils than those it is proposed to avoid, must
                                be started in the lower extremity of the valley and continued
                                up-stream; (3) that their construction at once would only be
                                technically permissible because the changes which the cut-offs at
                                first proposed would produce in the control of the river are of
                                slight importance. Moreover, upon examination of the project
                                presented, it is seen that it is not exclusively the cut-offs which
                                are proposed to avoid floods but the levees (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >bordos</hi>) which it would surely not have been possible to
                                construct in a good Condition of stability within the season of
                                torrential rains prevailing between the date of Minute No. 61 and
                                that of the floods. If, moreover, it is borne in mind that the
                                proposed works were calculated to hold a maximum flood discharge of
                                12,000 cubic feet per second, and that the flood which took place on
                                September 1, last, registered 13,500 cubic feet per second, it will
                                necessarily be deduced that even upon the completion of the works
                                the flood would have taken place on account of their insufficient
                                capacity and that, consequently, the general opinion prevailing on
                                the border, referred to by the American Boundary Commissioner, has
                                no foundation.</p>
                            <p>With respect to safeguarding the rights of both nations by adequate
                                precaution on the part of the International Boundary Commission, I
                                must inform Your Excellency that it is precisely the proposals
                                regarding sovereignty over the portions of land segregated by the
                                cut-offs and the various bancos formed at the very site of the
                                cut-offs which I have considered to be the precautions or, rather,

                                that, by orderly procedure, the cut-offs may be authorized. It is
                                solely the desire to avoid the development of new complications in
                                addition to those already existing which has impelled my Government
                                to proceed in the manner in which it has proceeded, it being very
                                far from its purpose to prevent the construction of works which it
                                considers and always has considered of the greatest urgency and
                                utility, especially if the study and its realization is extended so
                                as to secure the defense of the entire El Paso valley and not
                                exclusively of the small part now in question.</p>
                            <p>In summary, taking into consideration that the repetition of floods
                                will not be imminent until the last third of next year and that less
                                than a year would be employed for completing the proposed works and
                                agreeing upon the previous proposals above referred to, I beg leave
                                once more to insist, in accordance with the contents of my note No.
                                11089 of August 18, last, that the cases which I have referred to in
                                that note, and in the present note, should be considered and settled
                                by the International Boundary Commission before proceeding to the
                                construction of the proposed cut-offs.</p>
                            <p>The time employed in this preliminary work would not be lost in the
                                carrying out of the project, since the volume of the last flood
                                demonstrated the insufficient capacity of the proposed works and
                                that, consequently, the project will have to be revised by
                                increasing its capacity. Likewise, there can be studied during this
                                time the complete project of defense works in the entire El Paso
                                valley.</p>
                            <p>I hope Your Excellency’s Government will be pleased to agree to the
                                possibility and justice of meeting the conditions required by my
                                Government within the time now at our disposal.</p>
                            <p>Please accept [etc.]</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: Your Excellency knows that since
                            1861 there has been in Pichilingue Bay, La Paz, Lower California, a
                            coaling station maintained by Your Excellency’s Government and where the
                            United States ships coal.</p>
                        <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0667"/>
                        <p>Your Excellency’s Government is aware that the station was not
                            established in accordance with the laws of Mexico then in force, but
                            only by a permit which Your Excellency’s Government secured from the
                            Jefe Político of Lower California, which permit that authority had no
                            power to grant under the Constitution of 1857. In 1867, this permit was
                            confirmed, also without any legal authority, by Señor Don Sebastián
                            Lerdo de Tejada, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, but in doing so he
                            remarked that the present situation was permitted only because of the
                            good relations existing between Mexico and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, in May 1900, during the administration of General Porfirio
                            Días, in the same illegal manner, the permit was again extended, but the
                            point was emphasized both in the agreement which was made on the subject
                            and in the note which was sent to Your Excellency’s Government that the
                            permit was unilateral, that is, it was entirely an act of good will on
                            the part of Mexico and could, therefore, be revoked at any time. In
                            other words, the United States has only a precarious title to this
                            station, and for that very reason the permit may be revoked at any time.
                            That must be the understanding of Your Excellency’s Government.</p>
                        <p>The present Mexican Constitution, like that of 1857, does not permit
                            establishments of foreign governments such as the coaling station in
                            Pichilingue in the national territory, as these very stations afford
                            occasion for placing in charge persons in the service of the departments
                            of those governments and for permitting foreign war vessels freely to
                            enter and sail out of Mexican waters although they may be those of a
                            friendly nation.</p>
                        <p>The government of President Obregón, in compliance with its obligations,
                            has deemed the continuance of this situation to be irregular and illegal
                            and has, therefore, instructed me to state, as I now have the honor to
                            do, to Your Excellency’s Government that Mexico feels it has no legal or
                            moral power to continue this permission as it has been doing, and it
                            requests Your Excellency’s Government to remove within 6 months the
                            coaling station now maintained in Pichilingue.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Government trusts that the Government of the United States,
                            and particularly Your Excellency, will appreciate the fact that this
                            decision does not imply any unfriendly sentiment but that it is due
                            solely to the fact that the continued existence of that station is
                            incompatible with the fundamental laws of Mexico and with the honor of
                            the Mexican Government which is under obligation to see that the laws
                            are enforced.</p>
                        <p>It affords me [etc.]</p>

                            this capital,<note n="80" xml:id="d438fn80"><hi rend="italic"

                            being maintained by the Navy Department in Pichilingue Bay, La Paz,
                            Lower California, Mexico, and stating that the Mexican authorities feel
                            that they have no legal power to permit the existence of the station at
                            that place, and desire its removal within six months. There is also
                            enclosed a copy of a letter dated November 28, 1924, from the Secretary
                            of the Navy,<note n="81" xml:id="d438fn81">Not printed.</note> informing
                            me that the fuel depot in question will be permanently closed and
                            relinquished in accordance with the wishes of the Mexican
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, I desire to inform you that prior to 1911 vessels of
                            the Navy were occasionally permitted by the Mexican Government to visit
                            Magdalena Bay for drills, target practice and other purposes, such
                            permission being granted with the understanding “that the vessels do not
                            fire in the direction of the coast, land armed forces, or establish
                            camps ashore.” For your further information, I beg to refer you to your
                            Embassy’s despatch No. 1528, of January 7, 1909, on the subject of
                            Target Practice of the Pacific Fleet.<note n="81" xml:id="d438fn82">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>No doubt it would be extremely useful to the fleet if similar privileges
                            in those waters might be procured in the future, and you will note that
                            the Secretary of the Navy, in his letter of the 28th ultimo, strongly
                            urges that representations be made to the Mexican Government with that
                            end in view.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, before revealing to the Mexican Government the decision of the
                            Secretary of the Navy to accede to the request of the Mexican Government
                            in the matter of the desired closing and relinquishment of the coaling
                            station at Pichilingue Bay, it is desired that you discuss this matter
                            with the Mexican authorities, intimating that it is receiving favorable
                            consideration in compliance with expressed wishes and saying, in that
                            connection, having in mind the contents of the letter from the Secretary
                            of the Navy, above referred to, that the latter would deeply appreciate
                            the renewal of the permission heretofore accorded for the fleet to
                            operate from the waters of Magdalena Bay as an anchorage during periods
                            for which diplomatic arrangements will be made beforehand in each case.
                            You should point out that the privileges requested would seem to be in
                            entire accord with customary usages between friendly nations.</p>

                            <p>With reference to the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of December
                                27, last, it is stated that from 1903 to 1910, in view of the good
                                relations between both countries, Mexico granted to the United
                                States at its request permission for its naval vessels to hold
                                maneuvers and target practice in Magdalena Bay and for its coaling
                                ships to take up their station there. These facts caused the press
                                of Mexico, as well as of the United States and of other countries,
                                to publish news of a supposed cession of that bay by Mexico to the
                                United States. Because of this fact an agreement was reached with
                                the Department of State of the United States, and such news as had
                                given rise to unacceptable comment was corrected. Upon the
                                expiration of the last permission in 1910 Mr. P. C. Knox made the
                                statement to the Ambassador of <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588"
                                    facs="0670"/>Mexico that the United States did not intend to
                                request further permission for the reason that in the future naval
                                maneuvers and target practice would be held on the high seas.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing reasons and especially of the distrust which
                                this subject has raised whenever it is discussed, and considering,
                                moreover, that the good harmony and understanding which happily
                                exist between our two countries would be secured by avoiding a
                                question regarding which, however unjustifiably, there exist such
                                serious prejudices, Mexico would desire that the American Government
                                should for the present maintain the same point of view set forth in
                                1910 by the Secretary of State, Mr. P. C. Knox, and should continue
                                in its attitude of not requesting new permits for Magdalena Bay,
                                since such a decision would avoid all comment.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico desires to state to the Government of the
                                United States, however, that if eventually its Navy Department
                                should solicit, as an exception, a permit relative to the stationing
                                of its fleet in Magdalena Bay for maneuvers and target practice,
                                Mexico would be disposed, upon previous diplomatic negotiation in
                                each case, to indicate the conditions under which it would grant
                                such a permit in accordance with Mexican laws.</p>

                            confidental despatch No. 275 of January 26, 1925, transmitting copies of
                            correspondence exchanged recently between the Embassy and the Mexican
                            Foreign Office, in relation to the desire of the Navy Department for
                            renewal of the privilege heretofore accorded to the American fleet to
                            operate from the waters of Magdalena Bay as an anchorage during periods
                            for which diplomatic arrangements will be made beforehand in each case.
                            It is noted that the Mexican Government is disposed to grant the desired
                            privileges and to indicate the conditions to be observed if eventually
                            the Navy Department should wish to avail itself of the privileges in
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>In reply you are informed that the information contained in the Mexican
                            Note has been brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Navy.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that you now inform the Mexican Foreign Office in a formal
                            Note that the appropriate branch of this Government has informed the
                            Department of State that the fuel depot in Pichilingue <pb n="589"

                            relinquished in accordance with the wishes of the Mexican Government;
                            and you will address a separate Note to the Foreign Office conveying
                            your Government’s appreciation of the Mexican Government’s assurance
                            that it will indicate the conditions to be observed if eventually the
                            Navy Department should desire to avail itself of the privileges

                            application by the interested powers of the Statute of Tangier, which is
                            understood to have gone into effect on December 1, 1924.</p>
                        <p>It is the understanding of the Department that the application of the
                            Statute of Tangier would abolish certain commissions of which you are ex

                        <p>It is not the purpose of the United States to pursue a policy of
                            obstruction in the face of the effort made by the signatory powers of
                            the Tangier Convention to provide the Tangier Zone with a satisfactory
                            form of government, an effort which will of necessity alter in some

                            which merely involve unimportant departures from or non-observance of

                            for its information. However, in cases which may be regarded as

                            meeting. French consul general stated he was instructed not to assist at
                            any meeting purporting to be of Sanitary Council except in respect of
                            surrender of archives and funds to new administration. British and
                            Spanish consuls general concurred with him, all three maintaining
                            position that Sanitary Council ceased to exist on May 31st. Belgian and
                            Dutch consuls general were yet without instructions. Portuguese
                            representative made reservations similar to America. Italian diplomatic
                            agent read telegram from his Government refusing to recognize the
                            abolition of Sanitary Council until agreement was reached by powers
                            signatories to Act of Algeciras, and he refused to take responsibility
                            as president of Council of surrendering archives and funds.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my telegram
                            No. 7 of May 31st, 1925, reporting the action taken by the Mendoob, or
                            Sultan’s Representative in Tangier, in regard to the suppression of the
                            Sanitary Council, concomitantly with the formal introduction of the new
                            Tangier Administrative Régime, on June 1st, 1925, and I beg to transmit
                            a brief outline of events in this connection.</p>
                        <p>This notification by the Mendoob appears not to have been delivered to
                            the Italian Diplomatic Agent, President of the Sanitary Council, until
                            Saturday morning, May 30th, and was brought to my attention only at noon
                            on that day. It was therefore impossible for the American Government to
                            be advised, and to have an opportunity to express its attitude or
                            transmit its instructions to this Agency on the question, until after
                            the dissolution of the Sanitary Council was held to be an accomplished
                            fact by the Maghzen.</p>
                        <p>Although the Maghzen may consider itself justified in withdrawing the
                            powers conceded by it since 1840 to the Sanitary Council, it certainly
                            appears that it is open to the charge of unseemly haste, in abolishing
                            summarily on a few hours notice, the rights and trust which the Sanitary
                            Council had enjoyed for nearly a century.</p>
                        <p>The association of the three most interested Powers, France, Great
                            Britain and Spain, with the Maghzen, in this maladroit procedure is
                            indicated in the annotation, dated May 30th, of the British
                            Consul-General, on the Circular by which the President of the Sanitary
                            Council called a meeting for June 4th. This annotation was as follows:

                                <p>“The date of June 4th does not appear to me compatible with the

                                            conceded by His Majesty the Sultan to the Zone of

                                <p>On the other hand, we cannot, in my opinion, meet usefully,
                                    except to pronounce the closing of the current exercise of the
                                    functions of the Sanitary Council, register its suppression and
                                    transfer its accounts to the Maghzen.</p>
                                <p>I propose that a meeting, to be held for this purpose, take place
                                    to-morrow May 31st at 12.30 at the Italian Legation, if this
                                    hour suits Mr. President and my Colleagues.”</p>

                        <p>In a second <hi rend="italic">tournée</hi> of the Circular, the President
                            pointed to the impossibility of assembling a meeting at such short
                            notice as was suggested by Mr. Clive, and reiterated his convocation of
                            the meeting for the date originally fixed, namely, June 4th.</p>
                        <p>All members agreed to attend this meeting, but each of the
                            Representatives of France, Great Britain and Spain specified, in their
                            acceptance, that the object of the assembly was to liquidate the
                            Sanitary Council.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the British Consul-General, is the more surprising in
                            view of the information, communicated to me subsequently, by the Belgian
                            Consul-General, who is the President of the Committee of Control, under
                            the new Statute of Tangier, to the effect that it was by no means
                            certain, at the time when this annotation was made, that the Tangier
                            Convention could actually be enforced on June 1st, since the consent of
                            the Spanish Government was still in doubt, and as a matter of fact, the
                            Spanish Consul-General at Tangier received the instructions of his
                            government only in the early hours of Sunday, May 31st.</p>
                        <p>The first impression gained from the comments of my Colleagues, was to
                            the effect that none of them questioned the right, in principle, of the
                            Sultan to withdraw the powers which had been delegated by His Majesty’s
                            predecessors to the Sanitary Council, but my Italian Colleague at once
                            questioned the legality of the Maghzen’s action, in the premises, since
                            it was stated to be based upon the introduction of a new Tangier régime,
                            which has not been accepted by all the Powers accredited to Morocco.</p>
                        <p>The meeting of the Sanitary Council was held, at the Italian Legation,
                            this morning June 4th, as reported to the Department in my telegram No.
                            9 of June 4th, 1925, all the Foreign Representatives in Tangier being
                            present.</p>
                        <p>In pursuance of the instructions set forth in the Department’s cable No.
                            5 of June 1st, I confined myself, at the meeting, to the formulation of
                            the fullest reservations of the rights of the United States. The
                            Diplomatic Agent and Consul-General of Portugal, on the order of his
                            Government, made a similar declaration. The Italian Diplomatic Agent,
                            read out the following message which he had received from his
                            Government: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Italian Government not considering legal the Shereefian
                                    Dahir mentioned in the letter of His Excellency (the Mendoob)
                                    Sid Hadj Mohammed Buasherin, and while formulating therefore all
                                    reservations in respect of any eventual impairment of the
                                    Italian Government’s rights and interests, refuses to recognize
                                    the abolition of the Sanitary Council, so long as an agreement
                                    shall not have been reached among the Powers signatory to the
                                    Act of Algeciras.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0678"/>
                        <p>The Consuls-General of Belgium and of Holland stated that they had not
                            yet received instructions from their governments, and therefore desired
                            to abstain from making any declaration.</p>
                        <p>The French Consul-General stated that he had received peremptory
                            instructions from his Government not to assist at any meeting of the
                            Sanitary Council, which his Government considered to have become
                            abolished on May 31st, and that the only reason of his presence at that
                            assembly was to witness the transfer of the archives, accounts and funds
                            of the Sanitary Council to the new Administration. His British and
                            Spanish Colleagues concurred in this attitude.</p>
                        <p>The Italian Diplomatic Agent replied that, in view of the position he had
                            exposed, he could not, as President of the Sanitary Council, take upon
                            himself the responsibility of divesting himself of the charge of the
                            archives and funds of the Council.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing summarizes the result of the official deliberations.</p>
                        <p>During the informal discussions of the subject, among some of my
                            Colleagues, I observed that, apart from any legal considerations, and
                            without any reference to the view which the Department might adopt in
                            regard to the matter, my own personal feeling was one of regret that a
                            bond of common interest and co-operation, of so many years’ standing
                            between the Maghzen and friendly Powers, should have been, abruptly,
                            and, in my opinion unnecessarily terminated by such summary and
                            unceremonious procedure as that which had been followed.</p>
                        <p>From the cursory consideration which I have been able to give to the
                            question, for the moment, it would not seem that the disappearance of
                            the Sanitary Council will, in practice, have much bearing on the
                            existing rights of the United States, beyond, of course, depriving the
                            American Representative of a voice in the municipal and port regulations
                            and government in Tangier. In this connection, I would respectfully
                            refer the Department to the report on the constitution, organization and
                            legal powers of the Sanitary Council, contained in Minister Carpenter’s
                            Despatch No. 151 of July 21st, 1911.<note n="9" xml:id="d448fn9">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the abolition of the Sanitary Council, as it has been
                            effected, is a symptom that the coercive methods of France, Great
                            Britain and Spain, in the execution of their Tangier policy, have not
                            been abandoned, and will, it is apprehended, be further adopted in
                            matters of more concrete interest to the United States.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the inauguration of the Tangier Convention, there is
                            attached hereto, copy of the original French text, and translation, of a
                            communication addressed to me, under the joint signatures of the
                            Consuls-General of France, Spain and Great Britain,<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d448fn11">Not printed.</note> giving notification <pb
                                n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0679"/>of the application of the
                            Tangier Convention on June 1st, 1925. This notice was not delivered at
                            this Agency until the afternoon of Sunday, May 31st.</p>
                        <p>This office has received no copy of the “Dahirs” referred to in the above
                            mentioned communication, nor any notification thereof from the Sultan’s
                            Representative.</p>
                        <p>I gather that there is considerable dissatisfaction and frequent discord
                            between the Representatives of the Powers who have already adhered to
                            the Convention, namely, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium and
                            Holland, and who act at present as the Committee of Control. The Belgian
                            Consul-General, in particular, has been very openly expressive to me of
                            his grievances. He is the President of the Committee of Control, but
                            complains that he is treated as a non-entity by the Representatives of
                            France, Great Britain and Spain, frequently being asked merely to sign
                            decisions taken by them, without any deliberation of the Committee, and
                            often adopted at surreptitious meetings among the three.</p>
                        <p>Portugal and Italy, besides the United States, have not yet adhered to
                            the Convention.</p>
                        <p>Sweden has recently given its adhesion. Sweden was a party to the Madrid
                            Convention of 1880,<note n="10" xml:id="d448fn10">22 Stat. 817; Malloy,
                                    <hi rend="italic">Treaties</hi>, 1776–1909, vol. <hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">i</hi>, p. 1220.</note> and also a Power
                            signatory to the Act of Algeciras. There has, however, been no Swedish
                            Diplomatic or Consular officer of career in Tangier for very many years,
                            Swedish representation having been confided to a prominent Swedish
                            merchant, Mr. Carl Dahl, as honorary Consul-General.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Dahl informs me that his Government, acceding to the Tangier
                            Convention, stipulated that its adhesion did not imply a surrender of
                            Swedish capitulatory rights but a suspension thereof during the term of
                            the Convention, namely, 12 years, and that, if at the expiration of that
                            period, the Convention were not to be renewed, the Swedish Government
                            would resume its extraterritorial jurisdiction. The adhesion was further
                            subject to the condition that, if the Swedish Government should decide
                            to send, as its representative, to Tangier a Consular officer of career,
                            this representative should be admitted as a member of the Committee of
                            Control.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I would inform the Department that, in informal casual
                            conversations with some of the members of the Committee of Control,
                            notably, with the Belgian, French and British Consuls-General, after I
                            had learned that the Statute was to be enforced on June 1st, I expressed
                            the hope that no attempt would be made summarily to apply, on that date,
                            the announced laws and taxation to American citizens and protégés, as I
                            felt that it would be regrettable to complicate the situation by the
                            enforcement of measures, which I could <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598"
                                facs="0680"/>not countenance. I trust the Department will approve
                            this action on my part, which had for its object the avoidance of
                            possible claims, involving future controversy.</p>
                        <p>I regret, however, to say that it is reported to me that the Customs
                            Authorities appear already to have received instructions to withhold
                            delivery of imported goods, in all cases without exception, until the
                            new consumption taxes thereon have been paid by the destinees.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit, herewith to
                            the Department a brief account of the proceedings accompanying the
                            formal inauguration of the Tangier Convention, referred to in my No. 399
                            of June 4th, 1925.</p>
                        <p>The ceremony took place at the former German Legation, which, under the
                            terms of the Treaty of Versailles, was transferred from the German to
                            the Moorish Government, is now known as the “Mendoobia,” that is, the
                            official headquarters of the “Mendoob,” or Sultan’s Delegate to the
                            Tangier Zone, and in which are also located the meeting hall of the
                            International Legislative Assembly and the Courts of the Mixed
                            Tribunals.</p>
                        <p>At 10 a.m., on June 1st, 1925, the Mendoob, the Consuls-General of
                            France, Great Britain, Belgium and Holland, and their staffs, in full
                            uniform, the English Judges the French and Spanish Judges, the French
                            and Spanish public prosecutors, and all the nominated members of the
                            International Legislative Body, assembled in the Central Hall of the
                            Mendoobia. A limited number of invitations had been issued to prominent
                            members of the Tangier community, who represented the general public at
                            the ceremony.</p>
                        <p>The Mendoob opened the proceedings by reading in Arabic the Sultan’s
                            “Dahir” declaring the new Tangier Statute to be in force. This “Dahir”
                            was then read in Spanish by the Dragoman of the Spanish
                            Consulate-General, and in French by the Dragoman of the French
                            Consulate-General, as Secretaries of the Committee of Control.</p>
                        <p>The members of the Legislative Assembly then withdrew to their Hall, and
                            having taken their seats, were followed by the Mendoob and the five
                            Consuls-General above mentioned who, at present, compose the Committee
                            of Control.</p>
                        <p>The judges and public prosecutors then entered, and took their oath of
                            office, before the assembled authorities.</p>
                        <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0681"/>
                        <p>Mr. Briscoe, one of the English Judges, who by virtue of his seniority in
                            age, is President of the General Assembly of Stipendiary Judges,
                            pronounced a brief allocution in French formally establishing the
                            International Mixed Court of Tangier, and declared opened the first
                            session of 1925.</p>
                        <p>A similar declaration was made in Spanish by the Spanish Prosecuting
                            Attorney, after which the proceedings terminated.</p>
                        <p>During the ceremony a salvo of 21 guns was fired by the town
                            batteries.</p>
                        <p>After these ceremonies, the Legislative Assembly held its first official
                            meeting, at which it confirmed the resolutions which had been passed in
                            the course of its several informal and preparatory meetings held prior
                            to June 1st.</p>
                        <p>The population of the city showed no signs of enthusiasm on the occasion
                            of the establishment of the new governmental régime. Apart from the
                            irritation already caused by the increased port and harbor dues, and the
                            added burdens of new taxation, there is very acute discontent at the
                            restrictions and irksome formalities attending commercial transactions,
                            as a result of the enforcement of the Statute. Among these, the
                            precipitate establishment of a customs barrier on the frontier between
                            the International and the Spanish Zones, and the collection of duplicate
                            import duties at this barrier, before proper arrangements had been made
                            with Customs Authorities of the French and Spanish Zones for the refund
                            of such duplicate duties, have called forth the most violent
                            protestations.</p>
                        <p>A few days before the inauguration of the Statute, I was asked by several
                            members of the Committee of Control if I would officially attend the
                            contemplated ceremonies, and naturally replied, that, under the
                            circumstances, I regretted that it would not be possible for me to do
                            so. A formal invitation by the Mendoob for me and the staff of this
                            office, was however delivered to the Agency and Consulate-General, late
                            in the afternoon of Sunday, May 31st. No member of this Agency was
                            present at the proceedings.</p>

                            receipt on June 2 of your note dated May 31, 1925, in which you inform
                            me of an arrangement between the Governments of France, Great Britain
                            and <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0682"/>Spain to bring into
                            operation on June 1, 1925, the convention signed by those Governments on
                            December 18, 1923. You express the hope that this Government may welcome
                            the installation of a rule, the provisions of which have, in the opinion
                            of your Government, met with no fundamental objection by the Government
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In a note dated December 20, 1924, addressed to your predecessor, Mr.
                            Hughes stated that upon receipt of satisfactory assurances on certain
                            points which were discussed in the note, this Government would consider
                            the possibility of suspending its extraterritorial rights in Tangier to
                            the extent that they might appear to be adequately safeguarded by the
                            proposed new regime. I consider assurances on the points raised in that
                            note and satisfactory response to the two questions stated in the
                            penultimate paragraph thereof to be essential to further consideration
                            by this Government of the possibility of suspending extraterritorial
                            rights in Tangier.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of such assurances and response, I regret to have to
                            inform you that I can not acquiesce in the action which has been taken,
                            and am under the necessity of making full reservation of all rights of
                            this Government and its nationals, whether by virtue of custom or of
                            conventional arrangement, which may be affected by any effort to bring
                            into force the provisions of the convention of December 18, 1923.</p>

                            respectfully suggest that no reply be made, for the present, to the

                            collection of the taxes from them.</p>
                        <p>No endeavor is being made by the Authorities to impose the Stamp Tax on
                            the citizens or protégés, of the United States, of Italy or Portugal, as
                            it is evident that the enforcement of this tax against the <hi
                                rend="italic">ressortissants</hi> of these Powers, could only be
                            obtained through the medium of their respective Consular Courts, which
                            cannot, in the absence of the adhesion of their Governments to the
                            Tangier Convention, legally subject their nationals to the taxation.</p>
                        <p>As regards the other taxes, namely, the consumption taxes on Alcohol and
                            Beer, on Sugar, Tea, Coffee, Spices, and Candles, and the Registration
                            Taxes, the local Administration is in a position to employ, and
                            apparently intends to avail itself of, illegal but effective means of
                            extracting payment. For instance, American importers of commodities
                            subjected to consumption taxes, will apparently not obtain delivery of
                            their goods from the Customs Authorities, without the previous payment
                            of the consumption duties, over and above, the payment of the import
                            duties fixed by the treaties; and, transactions in real estate,
                            involving American purchaser or vendor, would be obstructed until the
                            latter had complied with the requirements of the “Registration”
                            Dahir.</p>
                        <p>In such cases, where complaints might be lodged at the Diplomatic Agency,
                            it is respectfully suggested, that I be authorized to instruct American
                            citizens and protégés to pay the taxes, under protest, and the
                            Department could consider the advisability of demanding the refund of
                            these illegal taxations, as a prerequisite to its eventual acquiescence
                            in their application to American <hi rend="italic">ressortissants</hi>.
                            This suggestion is made, on the assumption that the Department would not
                            desire to pursue a policy of more open resistance to the encroachments
                            of the local authorities, on American treaty rights.</p>

                                xml:id="d453fn14">Not printed.</note> In audience granted me today,
                            King spoke with confidence of new political arrangement and stated that
                            for one year preparations had been made looking to this change but that
                            conditions in Morocco had up to now prevented effecting it. He said
                            Tangier being an international zone cost Spain 20,000 soldiers to police
                            boundary and prevent contraband. He said he did not ask that Tangier be
                            turned over to Spain, but he believed that the powers should permit
                            Spain to police it and that this would help to solve the Moroccan
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Spain is quite tranquil. The suddenness of the change has created much
                            interest and it is believed to be a step toward normalcy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that an
                            Agreement has been signed at Madrid providing for naval cooperation
                            between Spain and France on the coast of Morocco.</p>
                        <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0685"/>
                        <p>The terms of the Agreement are said to be as follows: it provides for the
                            establishment of a joint naval surveillance by the two Powers off the
                            coast of Morocco between the 2nd meridian of West Longitude (Greenwich)
                            and the 27th parallel of North Latitude—that is to say, between
                            (approximately) the Algerian frontier and a point about 50 miles south
                            of Cape Juby, opposite the Canary Islands. This coast will be divided
                            into sectors by arrangement between the naval authorities, and in these
                            sectors the ships of the two Powers will act independently but in
                            cooperation for the purpose of stopping the importation of arms and
                            ammunition, and of preventing ships from having access to the coast of
                            Morocco except at those ports which are open to trade. To facilitate the
                            maintenance of this surveillance Spanish warships will be able to make
                            use of the French ports of Oran and Nemours, in Algeria, and French
                            warships will be able to use Algeciras, Malaga and Almeria, in
                            Spain.</p>

                            <p>On all the coasts subjected to the joint surveillance of Spanish and
                                French warships, pursuant to the notice given to-day to the

                                routes, the surveillance is limited to the six miles of territorial
                                waters, with the right to follow outside this limit.</p>
                            <p>In the other sectors, the surveillance extends to the particular
                                limits defined below: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Atlantic. Sector comprised between Cape Ghir and Cape
                                        Noun. The surveillance is exercised to the East of the line
                                        joining the points situated at six miles to the West of
                                        these two capes.</item>

                                    <item>Mediterranean. Sector comprised between Cape Trois
                                        Fourches and Cape Negro (North of Tetouan). The surveillance
                                        is exercised to the South of the line joining these two
                                        capes.</item>
                                </list></p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the presence and the organizations of the dissidents on
                                the coast rendering difficult and even dangerous, both trade
                                navigation and the operations of control exercised by warships near
                                the coast, the territorial waters of the sector, limited to six
                                miles, are forbidden to navigation between Cape Mazari (South of
                                Tetouan) and the point Abdun or Afraout (East of Alhucemas).
                                Consequently, any merchant ship met by warships in the prohibited
                                zone which cannot justify its presence shall be handed over to the

                                zone shall be exercised pursuant to the stipulations of Article 4 of
                                the Convention of December 18, 1923.</p>

                            <p>The vessels and boats which may be recognized by the patrol vessels
                                as engaged in trading in arms, munitions, war material and

                            reflecting upon an action attributed to the Department of State, in
                            regard to the American aviators, serving with the French forces
                            operating against the Riff.</p>
                        <p>The appearance of these comments in the local press came as a complete
                            surprise to me, in view of the fact that, upon receipt of the
                            Department’s telegram No. 9 of September 5th, 1925, I decided, after
                            careful consideration, to refrain from giving effect to the
                            discretionary instructions transmitted. It appeared to me, under the
                            circumstances, that the harm which had been done, might rather be
                            rectified by the silence, which was gathering over the waning glamour,
                            with which the French Authorities had sought to surround the
                            co-operation of the American aviators.</p>

                            regarding certain questions raised by the reported enlistment of
                            American citizens in the army forces of the Sultan of Morocco.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the following statement of the facts in the matter
                            will be of interest to you and will cover the points raised by your
                            constituent:</p>
                        <p>Several weeks ago letters were received by the Department stating that
                            American citizens were reported to be enlisting in the army of the
                            Sultan of Morocco for service in Morocco. These letters expressed
                            apprehension concerning the situation and appeared to consider that the
                            matter should receive the attention of the Department. <pb n="608"
                                xml:id="pg_608" facs="0690"/>The Department, realizing that the
                            misapprehension might also exist in Morocco, believed it advisable and
                            proper to inform its officer in Morocco of the laws with respect to the
                            enlistment of Americans in foreign military forces. It, therefore, sent
                            a telegram to the Diplomatic Agent and Consul General at Tangier stating
                            that in order to avoid any misapprehension which might be caused in
                            Morocco by the reports of alleged enlistment of American citizens in the
                            Sultan’s army, it was suggested that he might care to consider the
                            advisability of calling to the attention of American citizens in Morocco
                            the provisions of Section[s] 5282 and 4090 of the Revised Statutes of

                        <p>When the French authorities were informed of the intention of these men
                            to offer their services to the War Department, the French Ministry for
                            Foreign Affairs immediately took up the problem of deciding whether the
                            enlistment of foreigners was likely to provoke international
                            difficulties owing to the political status of Morocco, technically
                            governed by its Sultan but under the protection of France. It early
                            became apparent that, if entering the Sultan’s army, even for a limited
                            period, required a formal recognition of the Sultan as a potentate, any
                            American volunteer accepting such a pledge would forfeit <pb n="610"
                                xml:id="pg_610" facs="0692"/>his American citizenship; however, on
                            the 19th of July, the press announced that the aeroplane contingent
                            would be permitted to leave Paris within 48 hours to offer its services
                            to the Sultan of Morocco at Rabat, stating that the French military
                            authorities had been assured from Morocco that the Americans would not
                            be required to take any oath of fidelity which would endanger their
                            American citizenship, and that as a special favor the oath of fidelity
                            to Moslemism, which would require certain traditional rites to be
                            observed were Christians to be converted to the faith of the Sultan,
                            would also be waived. It was further stated that the entry of the
                            aviators into the Riffian forces would be facilitated by the French
                            authorities, uniforms would be provided, messing arrangements concluded
                            and a small, but satisfactory daily stipend allowed, the unit to remain
                            intact for aviation purposes.</p>
                        <p>Several receptions, banquets and luncheons were tendered the American
                            fliers during the period from their announced intention to volunteer
                            their services to their departure from Paris. At the reception given at
                            the Cercle Volney on July 29th Mr. Jusserand, former French Ambassador
                            at Washington, made an address, and the following day a luncheon was
                            given the volunteers at the Union Interalliée at which addresses were
                            made by M. Briand, Minister of Foreign Affairs; M. Laurent-Eynac,

                            Marcel Knecht, editor of <hi rend="italic">Le Matin.</hi></p>
                        <p>The first contingent of the aviators above mentioned left Paris on August
                            5th for Rabat via Marseilles, Barcelona, Malaga, making the journey in
                            planes driven by French pilots. At Rabat they were welcomed on August
                            11th by a group of French aviators who had come expressly from Fez, and
                            General Hoesch, former Marshal Lyautey’s Chief of Staff. At a luncheon
                            given in the officers’ mess of the 37th Aviation Corps to which the
                            American squadron was attached, the Presidential decree on the uniform
                            to be worn was read; khaki, stripes on sleeves and dark-blue cap. As a
                            distinctive mark the American aviators were given a five-pointed star
                            between two wings on the lapels of their tunic and their cap, this being
                            the emblem of the Sultan of Morocco.</p>
                        <p>On August 17th, Colonel Sweeney submitted to General Naulin, the French
                            Commander-in-Chief, his program—the departure by the end of the week of
                            nine aviators, in groups of three, flying to the army zones of Wezzan,
                            Fez and Taza, working alternately, and reassembling at Fez on Sept. 2nd.
                            The entire contingent of American volunteers (including some French
                            volunteers) was received in special audience, accompanied by former
                            Marshal Lyautey and his General Staff, by the Sultan of Morocco at the
                            Palace at Rabat on August 21st, at which his Majesty was presented an
                            emblem of the American squadron—a <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611"
                                facs="0693"/>gold medal—similar to one already accepted by former
                            Marshal Lyautey. Immediately after the presentation at the Palace, the
                            American fliers returned to Fez to be definitively incorporated to [<hi

                        <p>No news of any sort as to particular actions of the French air forces,
                            participated in by the Americans, has been published in any of the Paris
                            papers nor have any casualties been reported, with the exception of
                            Lieut-Col. Charles W. Kerwood, who sustained slight injuries at
                            Casablanca in making a bad landing during a trial flight late in
                            August.</p>
                        <p>French papers did not comment as extensively on the formation and actions
                            of the squadron as might have been expected, but their attitude was
                            uniformly laudatory, although several papers later published news of the
                            receipt by the American Legation in Cairo of a long petition, protesting
                            against the Americans taking this step, and stated that the Egyptian
                            Nationalist Press was extremely bitter in its comment. On September 22nd
                                <hi rend="italic">L’Humanite</hi> (the Communist organ) commented on
                            Secretary of State Kellogg’s reported advice relative to American
                            aviators in Morocco, as follows: “It would not be unsafe to say that
                            this is only America’s first step against the imperialist French plans
                            of a conquest of the Riff</p>
                        <p>The reported plans for the disbanding of the aviators have received
                            little or no comment in the press of Paris.</p>

                            in Morocco is based upon the spirit of the laws of the United States
                            regarding foreign enlistment, notably Sections 5282 and 4090 of the
                            Revised Statutes of the United States. Therefore, no official
                            recognition should be extended to any American citizens who have been or

                            which would ordinarily be extended to any private citizen of American

                        <p>3. Department’s instruction number 183, October 31,<note n="1"
                                xml:id="d467fn1">Not printed.</note> and subsequent telegraphic
                            communications relating to the proposed Nicaraguan constabulary. During
                            an interview with President Solorzano this morning he expressed a desire
                            that a plan for the establishment of a constabulary be submitted to him
                            and promised upon its receipt promptly to present it to Congress with
                            his recommendation that it be speedily approved. I inquired whether the
                            services of Major Keyser<note n="2" xml:id="d467fn2">U. S. Marine Corps,
                                commander of the Legation guard.</note> to organize and command the
                            constabulary were acceptable and he indicated that he would be pleased
                            to have him assigned for that duty. He stated that adequate provision
                            for the cost of organizing and maintaining the constabulary which he
                            desires to have cost as little as possible will be made in the new
                            [budget?]. The President desires that the Legation guard should be
                            retained until the constabulary is sufficiently well organized to make
                            its withdrawal feasible.</p>
                        <p>A brief report on Major Keyser’s plan will be cabled Monday.</p>

                        <p>Legation’s 3, January 3, noon. The commander of the Legation guard
                            received instructions yesterday indicating that the Legation guard will
                            be withdrawn from Managua in the latter part of January and that
                            legislation necessary to enable officers of the Marine Corps to
                            participate in the organization of the Nicaraguan constabulary probably
                                <pb n="619" xml:id="pg_619" facs="0701"/>will not be approved by the
                            United States Congress prior to the withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>I venture respectfully to recommend that if the decision to withdraw the
                            Legation guard in January is final and withdrawal is not to be made
                            contingent upon the establishment of a capable constabulary force the
                            Department should at an early date extend formal public recognition to
                            the Solorzano government and announce its intention to lend its
                            effective moral support. A hiatus after the withdrawal of the marines
                            and before full recognition might easily be misunderstood by certain
                            disaffected factions as an opportunity tacitly offered for the overthrow
                            of the Solorzano administration whereas receiving [recognition] before
                            withdrawal probably would prevent such misunderstanding.</p>

                        <p>9. Legation’s January 6 [<hi rend="italic">5?</hi>], 10 a.m. President
                            Solorzano requested me to call this morning to discuss with him the
                            withdrawal of the Legation guard. He appeared to be genuinely alarmed by
                            the prospect of losing the marines and urged me to cable to the
                            Department a full exposition of his views and desires. These are set
                            forth in the following excerpts taken from the draft of a formal note
                            which will be submitted to the Legation this evening by the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs:</p>
                        <p>[The excerpts have been omitted. For full text of the note, see the
                            Chargé’s telegram No. 13, Jan. 9, 1925, 10 a.m., printed on page

                        <p>Although the newspapers have not yet published definite information
                            regarding the withdrawal, there already exists some general alarm and it
                            is asserted freely, announced by foreigners and Nicaraguans alike, that
                            once the marines have gone a revolution will be inevitable. I am not
                            convinced that this is necessarily certain but it is the general
                            opinion.</p>

                            Department feels that it cannot delay the withdrawal of the Legation
                            Guard as it has definitely stated that it would be withdrawn after the
                            inauguration of the new administration, and as the Nicaraguan Government
                            has known for more than a year of the impending withdrawal, and has had
                            before it this Government’s offer to cooperate in the organization of a
                            constabulary. The Department will, however, be glad to cooperate in
                            every practicable way in organizing the constabulary, and I am again
                            bringing to the attention of the House Military Affairs Committee the
                            desirability of prompt action upon the pending legislation which would
                            authorize the employment of American Marine officers as instructors. It
                            is possible that this legislation will be approved before definite plans
                            for the organization of the constabulary can be worked out.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the Navy Department will withdraw the
                            Marines from Managua during January and that they will probably sail
                            from Corinto about February 9. In the meantime the Department will be
                            glad to have you and Major Keyser discuss plans for the organization of
                            a constabulary, keeping the Department informed of any concrete
                            proposals which may be made.</p>
                        <p>The Department has intended that you should continue to have formal and
                            cordial diplomatic relations with the new authorities. This of course
                            implies formal recognition and there is no objection to your making this
                            fact clear. You may also indicate frankly but orally to the leaders of
                            all parties that the new administration will have the moral support of
                            the United States in maintaining the constitutional order and that the
                            United States Government will be glad to extend any appropriate
                            cooperation to Señor Solorzano in carrying out the program outlined in
                            his inaugural address as reported by you in your January 2, 9 p.m.<note

                                    observations in behalf of the President of the Republic: It
                                    having come to his knowledge that the commander of the
                                    detachment of marines of the Legation guard has orders to
                                    withdraw from the country by the next boat and basing himself on
                                    the convenience [<hi rend="italic">desirability?</hi>] of

                                    Republic he states with the urgency which the situation
                                    requires: 1. That by the Government of the United States as well
                                    as by the Government of Nicaragua it has been considered
                                    undesirable to withdraw the American marines before having
                                    established in the country a national guard (constabulary) which
                                    the Government not only is obligated to create but greatly
                                    desires to fulfill as is [<hi rend="italic">was?</hi>] stated by
                                    the President in his inaugural address of January 1st. 2. The
                                    immediate withdrawal of the American marines among other
                                    lamentable consequences would cause: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)

                                    for although the Government counts with the majority of the
                                    country there are always persons who might avail themselves of
                                    the withdrawal of the constabulary [<hi rend="italic">Legation

                                    considerable sums of money which could be better employed in the
                                    development of resources or in the upkeep of public

                                    to this Ministry of Foreign Relations [in which] Your Honor
                                    kindly said in the name of your Government that the withdrawal
                                    of the American marines would not be effected without its due
                                    substitution by the organized National Guard in the form already
                                    established as desirable and convenient in order to prevent
                                    possible political and economic disturbances in the
                                    Republic.</p>
                                <p>In view of these observations the President states, Your Honor,
                                    his definite desire that the detachment of American marines be
                                    not <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0704"/>withdrawn until

                                    instructors the efficient service of the National Guard which
                                    would be very difficult if not impossible to effect in the
                                    absence of the Legation guard and he very earnestly and urgently
                                    begs Your Honor to be so good as to transmit this request by
                                    cable to Your Honor’s enlightened and cultured Government which
                                    at all times has given evidences of its sincere and esteemed
                                    friendship for Nicaragua and in this gratifying and satisfactory
                                    belief he permits himself to hope that whatever may be the
                                    circumstances which have caused this decision to be taken [by
                                    your Government] the gravity and urgency of the reasons which he
                                    indicates will impel its friendly spirit to a reconsideration of
                                    the orders already given in behalf of peace, order, well-being
                                    and benefit of the country, which apart from giving the high
                                    appreciation which is due this invariable sentiment on the part
                                    of the United States will certainly repay it with the full[est
                                    measure?] of its good will.</p>

                        <p>I informed President Solorzano informally that his note would receive the
                            most careful consideration. I also inquired whether there would be any
                            objection to the publication of his note to which he replied that he
                            would consult his Cabinet and inform me this evening.<note n="4"

                                <p>I am instructed to state in reply that my Government is somewhat
                                    surprised at Your Excellency’s statement that both Governments
                                    have considered it undesirable to withdraw the American Marines
                                    before the establishment of a National Guard, and the further
                                    statement <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0705"/>that this
                                    Legation had informed the Nicaraguan Ministry of Foreign
                                    Relations that the withdrawal of the Marines would not be
                                    effected until the proposed National Guard had been organized.
                                    The note which this Legation presented to Your Excellency’s
                                    Government on November 14, 1923,<note n="6" xml:id="d473fn6">See

                                    contained the following definite statement of my Government’s
                                    intentions: ‘Therefore my Government instructs me to inform Your
                                    Excellency that upon the installation in January 1925 of the
                                    Government coming into office as the result of the elections to
                                    be held in October 1924 it will feel that there is no further
                                    reason to maintain the Legation Guard at Managua, and the
                                    American Marines will accordingly be withdrawn at that time.’
                                    The note further stated that ‘As another evidence of its desire
                                    to assist Nicaragua in the orderly and undisturbed conduct of
                                    its normal existence my Government would be glad to assist the
                                    Nicaraguan Government in the organization and training of an
                                    efficient constabulary which would assure the maintenance of
                                    order after the Marines are withdrawn.’ While the note in
                                    question, therefore, definitely informed Your Excellency’s
                                    Government that the withdrawal of the Marines would take place
                                    in January of this year, it further proffered the assistance of
                                    my Government in training the proposed constabulary, should the
                                    Nicaraguan Government desire such assistance. My Government
                                    informed the Nicaraguan Government 14 months in advance of its
                                    intentions with respect to the Legation Guard in order to allow
                                    ample time for the Nicaraguan Government to take such steps as
                                    it might deem advisable. Under these conditions the
                                    responsibility for any unfortunate developments which might
                                    result from the failure to make adequate preparations to meet
                                    the situation created by the withdrawal of the Legation Guard
                                    clearly rests upon the Nicaraguan Government. My Government
                                    feels, therefore, that it would be entirely justified at this
                                    time in withdrawing the Legation Guard in accordance with its
                                    announced plan.</p>
                                <p>The Government of the United States, however, has always desired
                                    to cooperate in any proper way in promoting the peaceful
                                    development and prosperity of Nicaragua and it is therefore
                                    prepared, in consideration of Your Excellency’s statement that
                                    the Nicaraguan Government now desires to establish the
                                    constabulary, to accede to that Government’s request and to
                                    permit the Legation Guard to remain for such time as is
                                    absolutely necessary for the organization of the new police
                                    force. It can accede to the request of the Nicaraguan Government
                                    in this matter, however, only upon the definite understanding
                                    that the work of organizing the police force will be immediately
                                    undertaken and energetically prosecuted in accordance with a
                                    suitable plan. My Government understands that a period of from 3
                                    to 6 months should be sufficient for the creation of the
                                    constabulary and it is therefore disposed to permit the Legation
                                    Guard to remain at Managua until a date not later than September
                                    1, 1925, provided that satisfactory progress in the organization
                                    of the constabulary is made in the meantime.”</p>

                        <p>You may say that instructions will be sent at once to Major Keyser to
                            cooperate with Nicaraguan officials in taking the first steps toward <pb
                                n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0706"/>the organization of a
                            constabulary, and to assist, so far as his duties permit, in the
                            training of this body. The Department sees no reason why the necessary
                            regulations should not be formulated and recruiting and training should
                            not begin at once. Officers of the Legation Guard will be able to assist
                            in the instruction of the constabulary for the present, but it will be
                            necessary to consider later the permanent arrangements to be made
                            regarding instruction.</p>
                        <p>The Department desires that you should impress upon President Solorzano
                            the fact that the organization of the constabulary must be pressed
                            energetically, in order to have that body in satisfactory condition at
                            the earliest possible time. The Department desires to withdraw the
                            Marines before September 1, if practicable.</p>

                        <p>57. Your 204, February 17th. The amended constabulary plan outlined in
                            the Department’s instruction number 26, February 10, 3 p.m.<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d475fn8">Telegram not printed; see text of plan, <hi
                                    rend="italic">supra.</hi></note> has not been presented to the
                            Nicaraguan Government in the form of an official note to the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs but simply tendered as an unsigned memorandum direct to
                            the Minister of Gobernacion.</p>
                        <p>It appears also that the Nicaraguan Government has been given to
                            understand that the plan is not especially important or urgent and that
                            the withdrawal of the Legation guard has not actually been decided
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>The consequence has been that the unopposed efforts of the Government to
                            vitiate the plan have been practically successful. I have requested the
                            Government to withhold formal rejection of the present plan and to
                            submit instead a memorandum indicating its objections. This memorandum
                            indicates that it is not desired that the Legation guard shall have any
                            participation in the formation of the constabulary because any plan or
                            work effected by the marines would be provisional and because it might
                            appear to other Spanish American states [that] although the Government
                            of the United States desires to withdraw the marines the Nicaraguan
                            Government is endeavoring to retain them under any pretext. Other minor
                            objections relating to the accounting system are also pointed out.</p>
                        <p>These objections are specious. While the plan necessarily is provisional
                            it is contemplated that the instructors mentioned [in] article 6 will
                            arrive before the departure of the marines and such changes as they
                            recommend could be made gradually. Latin American susceptibilities could
                            be satisfied in brief statement by this Government of the fact that the
                            Legation guard is leaving by September 1st and is only assisting in the
                            organization of the constabulary in order to facilitate departure then.
                            The other objections are points of form only and can be readily
                            conceded. In fact amendments to articles 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were agreed to
                            by Major Keyser two weeks ago.</p>
                        <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0710"/>
                        <p>Major Keyser informs me that if the commencement of active organization
                            of the constabulary is delayed until the permanent instructors arrive it
                            will not be ready to replace the marines next September and that even
                            operating under the present plan there is barely enough time to organize
                            an adequate force.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully recommend therefore that I be instructed by radio to
                            present the Minister for Foreign Affairs a note embodying the plan
                            contained in the Department’s instruction 204, February 17th, with such
                            modifications as Major Keyser and I agree upon. These changes tend to
                            make clear the temporary nature of the participation of the marines and
                            to adjust procedures to Nicaraguan methods and to delay the disbanding
                            of the existing police and army forces. I should like also to be
                            authorized to inform the President orally that the statements made in
                            the Department’s instruction number 8, January 14, 4 p.m., are still
                            valid and that the Legation guard only will remain until [September 1]
                            provided satisfactory progress in the organization of the constabulary
                            is made in the meantime.</p>

                            the guard might assist in the organization of proposed constabulary, and
                            that if the Nicaraguan Government does not desire to proceed at once to

                            Government would no longer consider it necessary to retain the guard at

                        <p>96. My 95, May 15, 9 p.m. President Solorzano informed me Saturday that
                            it is his intention to begin at once the organization of the National
                            Guard. In answer to my inquiry whether, in view of the omission in the
                            new plan of the references to American cooperation which were contained
                            in articles 5 and 6 of the plan as presented <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631"
                                facs="0713"/>to Congress, the Nicaraguan Government intended to
                            forego American cooperation, the President stated that it is his desire
                            that the National Guard be organized by American instructors and that he
                            would have the Minister for Foreign Affairs make formal application for
                            our assistance in a note similar to the one of March 19th, quoted in
                            Legation’s 63, March 20th, 4 p.m.<note n="9" xml:id="d478fn9">Telegram
                                not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Monday I received a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating
                            that in accordance with the note of March 13th from the Ministry of
                            Foreign Affairs the Government of the United States was requested to
                            designate the experts who should definitely organize and manage the
                            instruction school of the National Guard. I advised the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs that the note of March 13th had been recalled by his
                            Government (Legation’s 63, March 20, 4 p.m.) and that communication just
                            received did not accord with the President’s statements on Saturday. The
                            Minister then called at the Legation apparently with the purpose of
                            endeavoring to make informal arrangements whereby the marines should
                            begin the organization of the National Guard without formal request for
                            their services being made. I stated to Dr. Urtecho that if his
                            Government desired our cooperation it should formally request it and I
                            further advised him that owing to the time which has been lost and for
                            other reasons it was not to be regarded as certain that a request for
                            the services of the marines would be granted. After a consultation with
                            the President, Urtecho returned to the Legation Monday night and renewed
                            his efforts to bring about an informal arrangement …</p>
                        <p>The next day I received another note from the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs stating that the Nicaraguan Government “accepted” the services
                            of the marines pending the arrival of the experts. I therefore again
                            explained to Urtecho that the omission in the new plan of all provisions
                            for our cooperation made it impossible for his Government to accept that
                            which no longer could be considered as proffered and repeated that if
                            the assistance of the marines was desired it must be requested. The note
                            was then withdrawn and a new one presented last night which contains the
                            following requests: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>Apart from all consideration connected with the unnecessary delays …
                            which have characterized the entire course of this negotiation, it is my
                            earnest conviction that based solely upon the nature of the plan as now
                            worded we should under no circumstances associate ourselves with the
                            organization and management of the Nicaragua constabulary. The present
                            plan is so designed as to place absolute control over training school
                            and constabulary proper in the hands of the Minister of Gobernacion
                            which will result in its conversion into a strictly political agency. It
                            is my opinion that request for the use of the marines now reluctantly
                            made is designed principally as an emergency measure to detain the
                            Legation guard until some other means may be found to bring about its
                            definite retention.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully recommend therefore that the request for the services of
                            the Legation guard be refused and that the Legation guard be withdrawn
                            at once and that before sending American instructors the Department take
                            such steps as may be best designed to safeguard us from being placed in
                            the position of appearing to be responsible for the kind of constabulary
                            which is to be formed.</p>

                        <p>66. Your 95, May 15, 9 p.m., and 96, May 20, 7 p.m. After careful
                            consideration the Department considers it advisable to comply with the
                            Nicaraguan Government’s request for assistance in organizing the
                            constabulary under the plan approved by the Nicaraguan Congress. The
                            plan gives the American instructors full authority over the constabulary
                            school and authority to inspect and make recommendations regarding the
                            constabulary proper. The Department does not feel that it should insist
                            on a greater degree of American control, as the ultimate control must
                            necessarily rest with the Nicaraguan Government.</p>
                        <p>The Department is, therefore, asking the Secretary of the Navy to
                            Instruct the commander of the Legation Guard, in consultation with you,
                            to designate qualified officers of the Guard to assist in the
                            organization of the constabulary pending the arrival of civilian
                            instructors to be employed under contract. It desires that you should
                            cooperate with Major Keyser in selecting well-qualified persons for this
                            work which will, in the nature of things, be temporary and preliminary.
                            The Department feels that it would be inadvisable to attempt any <pb
                                n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0715"/>permanent organization of the
                            school or the drafting of permanent regulations for its conduct until
                            the arrival of the civilian instructors.</p>
                        <p>The Department will endeavor in the very near future to submit to the
                            Nicaraguan Government the name of a well-qualified American with
                            constabulary experience, who might be employed as chief instructor and
                            who might be consulted regarding the appointment of his subordinates.
                            Meanwhile, you may suggest that the Nicaraguan Legation at Washington be
                            authorized to discuss with the person nominated all details regarding
                            salary and terms of employment, which of course must be arranged by
                            direct agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Department understands that the Navy can most conveniently withdraw
                            the Legation Guard during the first part of August and it is therefore
                            informing the Secretary of the Navy that there is no objection to the
                            withdrawal of the Guard at that time. It appears that it would be very
                            difficult to arrange transportation facilities earlier. The Department
                            is asking the Navy to regard the plan for withdrawal as confidential
                            until you consider it advisable to make a public announcement. …</p>

                                Elgin, Texas.</note> advises Department that he signed one year
                            contract with Nicaraguan Chargé d’Affaires on June 10th. He will be
                            “Chief of the Constabulary and of the School of Instruction of the
                            National Guard created by the legislative decree of May 14 of the
                            present year” and will prepare regulations for the school and for the
                            constabulary in accord with the Nicaraguan Government. He states that he
                            expects to sail for Nicaragua in about a week. The contract provides for
                            the employment of four additional American <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634"
                                facs="0716"/>officers as assistants. Further information is being
                            sent to you by mail.</p>
                        <p>While all arrangements have been made directly between Carter and the
                            Nicaraguan Legation without intervention by the Department, and while
                            the Department feels that it may contribute to the success of the new
                            constabulary if it is regarded as a purely Nicaraguan institution and
                            the officials are regarded from the outset as Nicaraguan employees
                            having no connection with the United States Government, it desires that
                            you should extend every proper assistance to Major Carter in the
                            performance of his duties, and that you should keep the Department very
                            fully informed regarding the progress of his work.</p>

                                printed.</note> The person designated by the Minister of Gobernacion
                            to prepare the rules and regulations of the National Guard and to confer
                            thereon with the Legation guard is General Carreles, who during the
                            constabulary negotiations published numerous articles over his signature
                            in the newspapers attacking the plan and especially American
                            participation and in which he consistently referred to us as Yankees in
                            a disparaging manner. This representative made only two requests which
                            were immediately granted by the delivery to him on June 10th and 13th of
                            two plans relating to the recruiting and classification of personnel. No
                            further requests for assistance were made and no intimation was given
                            that the services of the marines as provisional instructors were
                            anything but unwelcome. On June 3rd orders were received by the Legation
                            guard to prepare for withdrawal on August 3rd. On June 30 Major Carter
                            arrived at Bluefields and on July 1st one of his assistants arrived at
                            Corinto.</p>
                        <p>With matters in this situation the Minister for Foreign Affairs called
                            yesterday afternoon and informed me that his Government now possesses
                            funds for the organization of the National Guard and requests that the
                            marines undertake the organization and training of the recruits already
                            in Managua. I replied that with Major Carter and one assistant already
                            in Nicaragua I had not anticipated that <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635"
                                facs="0717"/>the services of the marines would now be requested and
                            that while the Legation is very much occupied with the difficult task of
                            preparing for early departure I would consult Major Keyser and the
                            Department. Major Keyser and I strongly feel that at this late hour the
                            marines should not be made responsible for the organization of the
                            National Guard.</p>
                        <p>I venture respectfully to recommend that I be instructed to inform the
                            Government that inasmuch as the chief instructor and one assistant
                            instructor of the National Guard are now in Nicaragua and should be in
                            Managua within a day or two and inasmuch as the Legation guard is
                            actively engaged in preparations for departure within a very few weeks
                            it is not deemed necessary and is furthermore impracticable for the
                            Legation to undertake the organization of the Nicaraguan National
                            Guard.</p>

                        <p>78. Your 113, July 3, 10 a.m. The Department approves of your advising
                            the Minister of Foreign Affairs that in view of the contemplated
                            departure of the Legation Guard on August 3 it is impracticable for the
                            marines to undertake the organization and training of the Nicaraguan
                            National Guard at this late date.</p>
                        <p>You may remind him that this Government has repeatedly declared its
                            readiness to assist the Nicaraguan Government in connection with the
                            organization of the constabulary. It did so in November 1923, and again
                            in January of this year, when at the urgent request of the Nicaraguan
                            Government it consented that the Legation Guard should remain in
                            Nicaragua for the time being. On this latter occasion, however, this
                            Government made it clear that it was acceding to the Nicaraguan
                            Government’s request only upon the definite understanding that the work
                            of organizing the police force would be immediately undertaken and
                            energetically prosecuted in accordance with a suitable plan. Nearly 6
                            months have elapsed during which the consideration of a plan for a
                            constabulary met with frequent and apparently unnecessary delays, and
                            during which the Nicaraguan Government showed little interest in the

                            appeared unnecessary to retain the Legation Guard longer in Managua.</p>

                        <p>134. Last night at about 11 o’clock General Alfredo Rivas, commander of
                            the Loma garrison, sent a newly-armed nondescript body of troops under a
                            subordinate officer to the International Club where a reception was
                            being held in honor of Doctor Leonardo Arguello, Minister of Public
                            Instruction. These troops forcibly carried off to the Loma as prisoners
                            Doctor Roman y Reyes, Minister of Hacienda, two editors and several
                            other men of alleged strong Liberal tendencies who were further alleged
                            to be unduly influencing and coercing President Solorzano.</p>
                        <p>General Rivas states he thus forestalled a revolution which he claims was
                            planned by the Liberals for next week. By his action he said that he had
                            avoided bloodshed and had aided rather than embarrassed the President.
                            He demanded the removal of several Liberal members of the Cabinet,
                            mostly under secretaries, and their replacement by conservative
                            Republicans. In this demand the President has apparently acquiesced.
                            Roman y Reyes is to be superseded by Adan Cárdenas as Minister of
                            Hacienda, and the Ministry of War is to be annexed to the
                            Presidency.</p>
                        <p>Business and communication are interrupted and considerable tension
                            prevails but the entire affair seems in a [<hi rend="italic">on
                            the</hi>] way to an early satisfactory settlement. There has been no
                            bloodshed though many of the guests at the reception were terrorized by
                            the firing of numerous shots into the air and by the shouts of the armed
                            men who carried away the prisoners referred to. The Legation will keep
                            the Department informed of further developments. Written report
                                follows.<note n="12" xml:id="d485fn12">Not printed.</note></p>

                        <p>138. Dominated by his wife’s family, threatened by the Conservatives
                            under Emilieno Chamorro who is now in Managua, urged by the Liberals to
                            assert his authority, President Solorzano has vacillated for a week
                            between offering his resignation or demanding the resignation of his
                            brother-in-law, General Alfredo Rivas, who was responsible for the
                            International Club incident and who now controls the garrison. Today
                            Rivas had an interview with President Solorzano at the President’s home
                            where the former appeared under guard of 50 armed men with two machine
                            guns which were trained on the house during the interview. Rivas
                            promises to surrender the Loma one week from today when it is believed
                            that he will be given some appointment which will carry him from
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>Politics have entered largely and bitterly into the situation, the
                            Conservatives being generally considered as responsible for much of the
                            trouble.</p>
                        <p>Thinking men of all parties appear to feel that there is no danger of
                            immediate revolution but that unless Rivas is soon relieved and the
                            President assumes firmer authority anarchy is likely to prevail
                            throughout the country.</p>

                            presence extricated President Solorzano from a difficult position and
                            stopped temporarily at least the tendency toward anarchy and revolution

                        <p>150. General Emiliano Chamorro took charge of the Loma fortress at about
                            4 o’clock this morning without apparent opposition. He informed me by
                            telephone at 7 o’clock that his express purpose was to drive the
                            Liberals from the Cabinet and to restore the Conservative Party to that
                            power which it enjoyed before the recent “fraudulent elections.” He
                            wishes Solorzano to remain as President and himself to be appointed
                            Minister of War or to have complete control of arms.</p>
                        <p>Adolfo Diaz as spokesman for Chamorro, various Liberal leaders and I have
                            been in conference with the President all morning. The Liberals are not
                            disposed to retire from the Cabinet even under Chamorro’s threat of
                            anarchy and revolution.</p>
                        <p>Chamorro’s armed men are firing in the streets and are said to have
                            killed two men in front of the President’s Palace during our
                            interview.</p>
                        <p>They threaten to take the President’s house before night and to control
                            the entire situation by force of arms if necessary. The President
                            continuing to vacillate has expressed the desire to rest and is inclined
                            to break the pacts<note n="13" xml:id="d492fn13">Agreements between the
                                Conservative and Liberal Parties in the election of 1924.</note> to
                            prevent further bloodshed and anarchy.</p>
                        <p>The constabulary occupies precarious position being surrounded by armed
                            Chamorristas vastly outnumbering them. The constabulary itself is
                            inadequate. I have requested the President to furnish constabulary with
                            machine guns and additional arms and ammunition.</p>
                        <p>I have been in communication with General Chamorro and have advised him
                            that this Legation had no other course to pursue than to support the
                            Constitutional Government and that any government assuming power by
                            force would not be recognized by the Government of the United
                            States.</p>

                            General Chamorro, whom he has joined in a signed document,<note n="14"

                                No. 817.00/3349).</note> agreeing (1) that the coalition pacts shall
                            be broken and be considered as of no value henceforth; (2) that the
                            Government be more entirely conservative; (3) that full amnesty be
                            granted to all participants in the recent military operations; (4) that
                            the Government pay General Chamorro 10,000 cordobas for the expenses of
                            this uprising, besides paying the troops; (5) that General Chamorro be
                            made General in Chief of the Army.</p>
                        <p>Chamorro is in complete control having today received all [demanded] from
                            the President. Chamorro then withdrew troops from the streets. There
                            have been about 20 casualties. Chamorro is sending 500 troops to Leon
                            tonight against the advice of the President and prominent men of both
                            parties. It is feared that serious trouble will develop then.</p>
                        <p>Solorzano is still President but can hardly be expected to continue in
                            office long.</p>
                        <p>Managua is quiet tonight but there is every indication that revolution
                            must develop as soon as the Liberals can arm themselves.</p>
                        <p>Complete change of the Cabinet seems imminent.</p>

                        <p>163. General Chamorro states that he is sending additional troops to Leon
                            to guard against alleged tendency of the Liberals to revolt and he
                            admits that his troops are resorting to forced loans. The Liberals claim
                            that stores are being sacked, merchants are being imprisoned, and a
                            peace-loving populace provoked to civil war, all in order to force
                            resignation of Vice President Sacasa, who refuses, is in hiding and
                            whose life they claim has even been threatened by the Conservatives.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that Chamorro and his followers want Sacasa to resign.
                            Whether or not he resigns, matters have now become so serious <pb

                        <p>169. Prior to his flight from Nicaragua Vice President Sacasa addressed a
                            note to me from Leon but which has just been received from Salvador in
                            which he asks that the Department be advised that since he had been
                            persecuted in his capacity of Vice President to a point where a verbal
                            ultimatum to Liberal leaders threatening his life had been made, he
                            protested to the Department against such procedure as being in violation
                            of article 2 of the convention signed in Washington on the initiative
                            of, and with the cooperation of the United States Government.<note

                        <p>114. Should President Solorzano resign, the Government of the United
                            States would accord recognition to any successor who had been elected or
                            appointed by constitutional means. However, the Government of the United
                            States would not extend recognition to any government which had come
                            into power by violent or unconstitutional means. To make a declaration
                            at this late date and under existing circumstances that the last
                            elections were null and void would be a course of very doubtful
                            legality, and one which the Department could not approve.</p>
                        <p>The policy of this Government with respect to the recognition of new
                            Central American governments has been stated frequently and publicly. It
                            is a policy in harmony with the expressed policy of these nations
                            themselves based on the General Treaty of Peace and Amity which was
                            signed at Washington, February 7, 1923.</p>
                        <p>This Department is strongly of the opinion that the continued and firm
                            application of this policy on the part of all the nations of Central
                            America as well as on the part of the United States—which ought to set
                            an example for them—is necessary to promote orderly political growth in
                            Central America and to discourage that tendency to resolve domestic
                            political questions by unconstitutional measures and force, which has
                            brought about such deplorable results.</p>
                        <p>The Department, therefore, cannot consistently act other than in
                            accordance with the General Treaty of Peace and Amity. Nor can it
                            deviate from the clear course which this policy may compel it to
                            take.</p>
                        <p>It is the Department’s desire that you should make plain its views to any
                            political leaders who may appear to be under any misapprehension
                            regarding them and to take special pains to make certain that its
                            attitude is thoroughly understood before the opening of Nicaraguan
                            Congress.</p>

                            courtesy might possibly return Vice President Sacasa to Nicaragua <pb

                            discouraged an idea apparently held by many Nicaraguans that in case of
                            President Solorzano’s resignation and Vice President Sacasa’s recall to
                            the Presidency the United States Government would use armed force if
                            necessary to permit Sacasa to assume and to discharge the duties of the

                        <p>115. Legation’s telegram 179 of December 14. The Government of the United
                            States would not employ its armed forces to place Sacasa in office
                            should Solorzano resign the Presidency. And while the United States
                            would not recognize the usurping government, yet it is under no
                            obligation to oppose such a regime with force and to put a
                            constitutional government in office. You should not, however, say
                            anything to members of Congress which might predispose the followers of
                            Chamorro to seize the Government even at the risk of not being
                            recognized. It should not be necessary to elaborate on the Department’s
                            policy as described in its telegraphic instruction No. 114 dated
                            December 9, 7 p.m. Nor should it be necessary to give out any specific
                            statement to the effect that the Government of the United States does
                            not contemplate using armed forces or interfering in the domestic
                            affairs in Nicaragua. Should anyone put a direct question to you you
                            might reply that our attitude in favor of constitutional government is
                            well known but that you are unable to state definitely what the
                            Department’s attitude would be in a hypothetical case arising in the
                            future. However, if you believe it necessary, impress upon the political
                            leaders of Nicaragua that we hope that peace and tranquillity will
                            continue in the Republic and that questions now disturbing the country
                            may be resolved to the satisfaction of all, but that Nicaragua’s
                            political problems must be solved by the Nicaraguan people
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Department does not believe it wise to return Sacasa on a war vessel.
                            That might create an embarrassing precedent. Furthermore, it would most
                            likely be misunderstood because of the present political situation in
                            the Republic of Nicaragua.</p>

                        <p>184. Certain prominent local lawyers dissenting regarding its legality,
                            several are nevertheless recommending that a constituent assembly be

                            actually to effect an entire change of government.</p>
                        <p>In this, just as in the recently proposed nullification of the last
                            elections, the firm opposition of this Legation has thus far
                            prevailed.</p>
                        <p>… Chamorro continues to profess unwillingness to set up a government
                            which might fail recognition of the United States. Furthermore he
                            repeatedly asks me to recommend a solution of the local problems which
                            might prove satisfactory to the Department. My reply has just as
                            persistently been that no government founded on violence could
                            [receive?] recognition by the United States and to receive such
                            recognition the Nicaraguans themselves, keeping within the Constitution,
                            must apply their own remedies to their own political problems.</p>

                            three Liberal members from the Supreme Court. Charges against Sacasa of
                            conspiracy have been telegraphed to him through the Legation and he has
                            been given 25 days within which to return and answer such charges
                            failing which it seems to be their intention to declare the Vice
                            Presidency vacant, secure Solorzano’s resignation, and proceed to elect
                            successors constitutionally.</p>

                        <p>120. Legation’s 184 dated December 18, 4 p.m. Department approves your
                            action in discouraging the calling of a constituent assembly to bring
                            about a change of government.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The action of Congress in disqualifying 11 of its members is of concern
                            to the Department. Is this not tantamount to at least a partial
                            nullification of the last elections? The Department desires your views
                            on this subject. Such action might bring about the formation of an
                            unconstitutional Congress whose acts like the appointment <pb n="645"
                                xml:id="pg_645" facs="0727"/>of <hi rend="italic">designados</hi>
                            might be questioned as to their legal validity. In the opinion of the
                            Department the followers of Chamorro may subject themselves to serious
                            criticism, because of the action taken against Sacasa. According to the
                            Department’s understanding, Sacasa is the Constitutional Vice President
                            and merely sought refuge outside the Republic when armed troops without
                            warrant were dispatched to arrest him. This action is greatly deprecated
                            by the Government of the United States and if continued might well be
                            considered prima facie evidence of unconstitutional action by those
                            responsible for it. You may make this clear.</p>
                        <p>The following is for your own information. Señor Sacasa as Vice President
                            requested an interview today to pay his respects. I received him and
                            after the usual complimentary remarks he attempted to explain political
                            matters. I replied that it was my invariable custom not to discuss the
                            political questions of a foreign nation with its citizens unless the
                            latter were introduced by the diplomatic representative of that nation;
                            that I had received him in his capacity of Vice President and because he
                            merely desired to pay his respects; and that I must decline to discuss
                            with him the political situation in his country. I then stated that I
                            perceived no objection to his expressing his views informally to the
                            Chief of the Division of Latin American Affairs, Mr. Francis White. The
                            latter then explained to Señor Sacasa the policy of the United States of
                            lending our moral support to the Constitutional Government and extending
                            our efforts in behalf of orderly procedure in Central America. However,
                            Mr. White made it clear that this did not mean that while the United
                            States would not recognize the unconstitutional government it would use
                            force to place in office the Constitutional Government: in other words,
                            to place Señor Sacasa in the Presidency should President Solorzano
                            resign and some other person unconstitutionally usurp the office. Mr.
                            White also told him that although the Department desired to render any
                            proper aid to the republics of Central America in the solution of their
                            political problems nevertheless it believed that the regeneration should
                            come from within through a desire of the people for constitutional
                            government; that although the Department would lend its support to any
                            element seeking this end yet it would not assume the responsibility of
                            seeing that this is accomplished. To be more specific, as long as the
                            people of Central America feel that the “last word” comes from the
                            Department the attainment of political stability will be postponed; the
                            sooner there is created among the citizens of Central American countries
                            a feeling of responsibility which shall give rise to the realization
                            that they themselves must work out their own destiny the sooner will
                            orderly government develop in those countries.</p>

                        <p>186. Your telegram 120 December 21, 9 p.m. The plans for nullifying the
                            last elections and for convoking a constituent assembly have been
                            abandoned for the present at least. However plans for disqualifying
                            members of Congress have proceeded in spite of the fact that I
                            repeatedly expressed the opinion that this would be tantamount to at
                            least a partial nullification of the last elections. President Solorzano
                            reaffirms his intention to resign in the near future. The plan which
                            many including myself considered least dangerous and the one which
                            Chamorro professed for several weeks he had tacitly agreed to—namely, to
                            name Diaz as <hi rend="italic">designado</hi> in case Solorzano should
                            resign—was replaced rather suddenly today with another: (1) Chamorro to
                            be nominated at once to fill a vacancy in the Senate to be created
                            through the resignation of a friend; (2) Chamorro to be elected Senator
                            at the regular election time on January 3; (3) Chamorro to be appointed
                                <hi rend="italic">designado</hi> during the week following or on
                            January 11. The highest legal talent has recommended this and today
                            Chamorro expressed himself as inclined to take this advice regardless of
                            the opinion which I frankly gave him that were he to become President in
                            this way, or in any other way, and especially within three months of his
                            armed intimidation of President Solorzano, that step would be of such
                            doubtful legality that the Government of the United States would almost
                            certainly feel compelled to withhold recognition.</p>

                                Taxation for the Country Communities, and Article 10 in fine of the
                                Law of Taxation for the Cities of August 18, 1911, which two Law
                                Provisions are identical: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        country are exempt from taxes on property in and income from

                                        sale of tickets for the transportation of persons out of the
                                        kingdom; provided that Norwegian persons, companies and
                                        corporations are exempt in the country in question from
                                        taxes on corresponding activities. If this be not the case,
                                        the King can decide that foreign persons, companies and
                                        corporations shall pay taxes on property and/or income on
                                        activities as mentioned. In so far as sale of tickets for
                                        transportation of persons out of the kingdom is concerned,
                                        this does not apply but when the sale is effected through an

                                        16, 1921. The King will also issue regulations concerning
                                        the extent of the taxation and the assessment and collection
                                        of the taxes.”</p>

                            to bring the matter up for discussion with the Panaman Government until
                            it is definitely settled by the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it might be advantageous if some definite
                            understanding could be reached concerning the status, in the Canal Zone,
                            of Diplomatic as well as Consular officials who are accredited to the
                            Republic of Panama. The question has arisen upon several occasions as to
                            whether or not such officials are entitled to diplomatic immunity in the
                            Canal Zone, and more recently the question has come up as to whether or
                            not a Secretary of this Legation can be called upon for Jury duty in the
                            Canal Zone Courts.</p>
                        <p>It is thought that it would be advisable if a ruling could be made
                            concerning the status, in the Canal Zone, of our own Diplomatic Officers
                            as well as those of other Governments who are exercising their functions
                            in the Republic of Panama, but the Legation has avoided bringing up the
                            question for fear of involving, in some way, the sovereignty of the
                            United States over the Canal Zone. The Canal Zone authorities appear to
                            be in doubt as to the course which they should pursue, especially as
                            regards Consuls.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore respectfully requested that some sort of ruling be made
                            which can be used as a basis for definitely determining all of these
                            matters.</p>

                                    . . . . . , and has the honor to state that the Government of
                                    the United States believes it to be desirable that foreign
                                    consuls exercising consular functions in the Isthmian Canal Zone
                                    should do so under exequaturs issued by the Government of the
                                    United States. It is requested, therefore, that hereafter an
                                    additional commission, addressed to the President of the United
                                    States, be issued to all consuls of the . . . . . . . . . .

                        <p>Through an apparent oversight on the part of this Department the contents
                            of the foregoing circular were not formally communicated to your
                            Department, and it is therefore not unlikely that certain consular
                            officers of foreign governments stationed in the Republic of Panama have
                            been allowed under the former arrangement to perform consular functions
                            in the Canal Zone. It appears, however, that the majority of such
                            officers have been granted exequaturs by this Government upon the
                            application therefor of their respective governments.</p>
                        <p>When the circular note of February 17, 1921, was brought to the attention
                            of the Government of Panama, the latter strongly contested the right of
                            the United States to issue exequaturs to foreign consular officers in
                            the Canal Zone, arguing that Panama still retained titular sovereignty
                            over the Zone and that the right asserted by the United States was not
                            one necessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, sanitation
                            or protection of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>The Panaman Government was informed that the action of the United States
                            in the premises was prompted by the necessities incidental to the proper
                            operation of the Canal and that ample authorization therefore was
                            contained in Article III of the Treaty of November 18, 1903,<note n="8"

                            granted to the United States all the rights, power and authority with
                            respect to the Canal Zone which the United States would possess if it
                            were sovereign over that territory.</p>
                        <p>After an offer to submit the question to international arbitration had
                            been rejected by this Department on the ground that the language of the
                            Treaty was clear on the point, the Panaman Government advised all
                            foreign governments maintaining consular representatives <pb n="653"
                                xml:id="pg_653" facs="0735"/>in the Republic of Panama that it would
                            withdraw recognition from any such officers who secured exequaturs from
                            the Government of the United States for use in the Canal Zone.</p>
                        <p>The matter is clearly one which involves the exercise of sovereign rights
                            in the Canal Zone in regard to which the United States Government has
                            consistently maintained the position that there can be no departure from
                            the provisions of the Treaty. It appears to be desirable that this
                            position should be affirmed by the United States at the present
                            juncture, in view of its possible beneficial effect on the course of the
                            treaty negotiations now in progress between commissions representing the
                            two countries. I would, therefore, suggest that you bring the circular
                            note of February 17, 1921, to the attention of the Governor of the Canal
                            Zone, to the end that the system outlined therein may be enforced with
                            respect to all consular officers who were not at that time permitted to
                            perform their functions in the Canal Zone.<note n="9" xml:id="d508fn9"

                            state: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is thought that it would be advisable if a ruling could be

                                    Diplomatic Officers as well as those of other Governments who
                                    are exercising their functions in the Republic of Panama, but
                                    the Legation has avoided bringing up the question for fear of
                                    involving, in some way, the sovereignty of the United States
                                    over the Canal Zone. The Canal Zone authorities appear to be in
                                    doubt as to the course which they should pursue, especially as
                                    regards Consuls.</p>

                        <p>With regard to the diplomatic officers of the United States accredited to
                            the Republic of Panama the Department is of the opinion that such
                            officers have the same status with respect to the Canal Zone as to any
                            other territory over which the United States exercises jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>Respecting diplomatic officers of foreign governments accredited near the
                            Government of Panama you are informed that a review of the authorities
                            on international law has failed to reveal a satisfactory <pb n="654"
                                xml:id="pg_654" facs="0736"/>definition of their status in the
                            territory of the Canal Zone. It would seem, however that their status
                            might be regarded as analogous to that of a diplomatic envoy traveling
                            through the territory of a third state en route to his post. In the
                            latter case, since the institution of legation is a necessary one for
                            the intercourse of states and is firmly established by international
                            law, there ought to be no doubt whatever that such a third state must
                            grant the right of innocent passage (<hi rend="italic">jus transitus
                                innoxii</hi>) to the envoy, provided that it is not at war with the
                            sending or receiving state. The United States asserts that, according to
                            the law of nations a diplomatic officer is entitled to a right of
                            transit to his post by sea, or through the national domain, whether land
                            or water, of a state other than that to which he is accredited. It is
                            not contended, however, that this right embraces one of sojourn in such
                            state, or that the sovereign thereof may not prescribe the route of
                            transit. While evidence is wanting that states generally have as yet
                            agreed to yield rights of jurisdiction over diplomatic officers not
                            accredited to them and passing through their territories, it is not
                            unreasonable to claim for such individuals freedom from petty annoyance
                            whether in the form of criminal prosecution for minor offenses or of
                            civil suits of trivial importance.</p>
                        <p>For your further information and guidance, it may be stated that consular
                            officers as such, not being diplomatic officers, cannot claim as of
                            right the privileges and immunities accorded the latter. Consular
                            officers do, however, enjoy certain rights and privileges derived from
                            international law and treaties. A consular officer may reasonably claim
                            inviolability for the archives and official property of his office. By
                            various treaties, the inviolability of the consular offices and
                            dwellings is expressly secured. This does not imply, however, that a
                            consular dwelling may be used as an asylum.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of treaty, a consular officer may justly claim for himself
                            and his office those rights which are accorded by international law. He

                            sojourn to consuls of other states, except so far as they rest upon
                            treaties which through lack of conventional arrangement with this
                            country he is not entitled to invoke.</p>
                        <p>Consular officers do not enjoy exemption from local jurisdiction. The
                            territorial sovereign is not obliged to yield so great a privilege. In
                            the absence of treaty, it is expected that that sovereign, in the matter
                            of service of process or the taking of testimony, or otherwise, will
                            exercise its rights of jurisdiction in such a manner as to cause the
                            least possible interference with the necessary exercise of the consular
                            function.</p>

                                    Government of the United States believes it to be desirable that
                                    foreign consuls exercising consular functions in the Isthmian
                                    Canal Zone should do so under exequaturs issued by the
                                    Government of the United States. It is requested, therefore,
                                    that hereafter an additional commission, addressed to the
                                    President of the United States, be issued to all consuls of the
                                    … Government who may be appointed or assigned to the Canal Zone,
                                    and be presented to this Government with the request for the

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Note has been taken of the reference in your despatch under
                            acknowledgment to the foregoing circular and of your statement regarding
                            your conversations with the Canal Zone authorities concerning its
                            present enforcement by the latter. For your information in this
                            connection there are enclosed herewith copies of correspondence between
                            the Department and the War Department, relating to the subject, from
                            which you will note that the Department has considered it desirable that
                            the system of recognizing foreign consuls in the Canal Zone, outlined in
                            the before mentioned circular of February 17, 1921, should be put into
                            force immediately. The reasons which prompted the Department to take
                            this action are set forth in its letter to the Secretary of War, dated
                            April 2, 1924, a copy of which accompanies this instruction.<note n="10"

                            obtain United States exequaturs prior to January 1, 1925, it would seem

                            privileges which are customarily extended by third states to diplomatic
                            officers of foreign governments, it being understood, however, that it
                            is always incumbent upon those officers to establish their identity to
                            the satisfaction of the authorities of the Canal Zone with whom they may

                        <p>24. Great excitement prevails here over the Indian uprising which appears
                            to be general along the north coast from Porvenir to Obaldia. Several
                            villages are reported to have burned and a number of Panaman police
                            officers and private individuals variously estimated at from 10 to 30
                            are said to have been killed. A force of 200 Panaman <pb n="658"

                            uprising and am informed by the Indians that Marsh has attempted to
                            restrain them and that their being on warpath is due to grave injustices
                            done them by Panamans. Indians have agreed to suspend hostilities if not
                            attacked by Panamans. Panama has been informed of this but has sent
                            instructions to troops here “to seize all vessels and boats pertaining
                            to the Indians and prevent all kinds of traffic with and between
                            them.”</p>
                        <p>Panaman Government has advised me it will insist on Marsh’s trial and
                            punishment if found guilty. Marsh now aboard ship at my request with the
                            understanding he may return to Indians if he so desires. If allow him to
                            return to the United States and to suspend operations against Indians
                            the incident would be closed. I suggest that the Department, through the
                            Legation, endeavor to bring this about.</p>

                        <p>Marsh is involved at least to the extent of having reduced to writing the

                        <p>29. I returned to Panama this afternoon by air, leaving U. S. S. <hi
                                rend="italic">Cleveland</hi> at Carti. I hope to persuade the
                            Panaman Government to settle troubles with the Indians amicably,
                            promising no retaliation for the recent uprising and better treatment of
                            Indians in the future.</p>
                        <p>From thorough investigation made on the spot I am convinced charges made
                            by Indians against the Panaman authorities are true and that the Indians
                            have been shamefully treated.</p>
                        <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0743"/>
                        <p rend="center">[Paraphrase]</p>
                        <p>My opinion is that uprising was inevitable, just, and reasonable, and
                            that Marsh did not foment it, although he permitted his sympathy for the
                            Indians to lead him too far. Feeling against him is so strong in Panama
                            that if he is extradited he cannot obtain a fair trial.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Panama contemplates asking for assistance in
                            resubjugating the Indians. This it will do through its Legation in
                            Washington. I respectfully and earnestly suggest that Panama be given no
                            assistance for the present in carrying out retaliatory or punitive
                            measures. Leaving aside the justice of the cause of the Indians I am of
                            the opinion that any effort to subdue them by force will be protracted
                            and expensive and if undertaken by Panamanians will be doomed to
                            failure.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow I plan to return to Carti for further conference with the Indian
                            chiefs. I shall be accompanied by the Foreign Minister or other
                            representatives of Panama.</p>

                        <p>31. My March 3, 2 p.m. number 30.<note n="23" xml:id="d521fn23">Not
                                printed.</note> After 6-hour conference between Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, Minister of Justice and 13 Indian chiefs representing northern
                            San Bias region, an agreement was drawn up and signed along the
                            following lines:<note n="24" xml:id="d521fn24">The agreement was signed
                                at Porvenir, capital of the police district of San Blas.</note>
                            One—The Indians submit to the laws and authority of Panama and agree not
                            to commit further hostile acts; they promise to return all arms and
                            other property captured from the police or taken from private
                            individuals; the Government of Panama will allow them to keep their
                            shotguns and will return those which have been taken from the Indiana by
                            the police; the Government of Panama will maintain such officials in the
                            Indians’ territory as may be necessary to represent Panama authority and
                            maintain order but will in general leave to the Indians to maintain
                            order among themselves; the Government of Panama will not impose schools
                            upon the Indians; the Government of Panama will respect the right of the
                            Indians to follow their own manners and customs and assures to them the
                            same rights which are enjoyed by other Panaman citizens.</p>
                        <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0744"/>
                        <p>I signed the agreement as a witness only. Subsequently an official
                            inquiry was made into the activities of Marsh at which it was decided
                            that there was not sufficient evidence against him to ask for his
                            extradition. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will recommend to the
                            President that on Marsh’s arrival at the Canal Zone the Canal Zone
                            authorities be asked to deport him as an undesirable. This seems to me
                            best possible solution. Meeting ended in a friendly spirit and I hope
                            relations between Indians and Panaman Government will be much improved
                            in future. Am proceeding on U.S.S. <hi rend="italic">Cleveland</hi> with
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice to Aligandi
                            tomorrow to endeavor to procure acceptance of the above agreement by
                            Indians there.</p>

                            Santa Ana Plaza last night when Tenants’ League under the leadership of
                            foreign and Panaman labor agitators attempted to hold a meeting in
                            defiance of decree of the municipal authorities. Police fired on the mob
                            after unsuccessful efforts to disperse the meeting by peaceful means and
                            after shots had been fired by rioters. Order was soon restored.</p>

                        <p>96. My 95, October 11, 9 a.m. Minor disturbances continued throughout
                            yesterday and last night, chauffeurs and street-car employees went on
                            strike paralyzing traffic. Private owners of automobiles, including
                            Americans, have been molested by crowds. The Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            this morning formally asked me to have 300 American troops sent into the
                            city to assist Panaman police in maintaining order. He stated that
                            disturbances resulting in serious bloodshed would occur this morning
                            unless this cooperation were extended and that while the Panaman
                            Government could dominate the situation it could not keep transportation
                            services operating or extend adequate protection to foreigners without
                            help. Since there appeared to be a real emergency in view of intense
                            excitement of laboring classes throughout the city and reported
                            disaffection of part of police force and firemen, I communicated the
                            Government’s request to the Acting Governor of Canal Zone; and after
                            consultation with him I informed the Panaman Government that the
                            American military authorities would assume full control of the policing
                            of the city if the Panaman Government should so request in writing
                            stating that it was unable to maintain [order], but that the American
                            military authorities did not feel able to send a force merely to
                            cooperate with the Panaman police. I also said that American forces are
                            being sent meanwhile to the Zone boundary line in readiness to act
                            should serious <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0746"/>disorders occur.
                            It is very possible that the moral effect of this measure will in itself
                            prevent serious disturbances.</p>

                        <p>97. My October 12, 11 a.m. At the President’s request, the Governor of
                            the Canal Zone, the Commanding General and I conferred with him and the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs this noon. The President stated that the
                            subversive movement was growing rapidly and that the morale of the
                            police force was deteriorating through overwork and propaganda. The
                            President referred to the fact that transportation services have been
                            paralyzed today through intimidation and that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >inquilinos</hi><note n="25" xml:id="d527fn25">Tenants.</note> had
                            announced that they would stop supply of bread and other food tomorrow.
                            He thought that the Government could dominate the situation by the use
                            of force but with much bloodshed and without being able to terminate the
                            present agitation. He therefore inquired under what conditions the
                            American military authorities would take over the maintenance of order
                            if requested to do so. The Commanding General stated that he would have
                            to assume full control of the policing of the city but with as little
                            interference as possible with the functioning of the Panaman
                            authorities. Subsequently the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent me a
                            formal note requesting the assistance of the United States in the form
                            outlined at the conference. I so informed the Governor and about 600
                            American troops entered the city at 2 p.m., so far as I know without
                            serious incidents. Practically all street traffic was suspended this
                            morning and nearly all stores and business houses were closed. Several
                            Americans appealed to me for assistance saying that they were being
                            compelled by threats of mob violence to close their places of business,
                            and I am informed that many more made similar complaints to the Governor
                            of the Canal Zone. The Panaman Government was obviously unable to extend
                            protection in such cases. I am convinced that a very serious situation
                            would have developed within 24 hours and that there would probably have
                            been more bloodshed if the Canal authorities had not intervened.</p>

                        <p>98. Department’s 63, October 13, 3 p.m. Conditions in the city are
                            rapidly returning to normal. The almost immediate resumption of work by
                            street-car employees, chauffeurs, and vendors in market shows that the
                            strikes which paralyzed transportation and threatened to cut off the
                            city’s food supply were due chiefly to intimidation by radical labor
                            elements.</p>
                        <p>On Monday night a clash occurred between soldiers and a crowd of workmen
                            whom the soldiers were trying to disperse. A few Panamans were injured
                            and one was killed by falling from a balcony. Many arrests were made.
                            With this exception there have been no unfortunate incidents.</p>
                        <p>Several labor agitators have been arrested and those who are foreigners
                            will be deported. The Government proposes to dismiss those employees who
                            have been unduly prominent in the rent-payer movement. I have suggested
                            to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the inadvisability of removing
                            employees simply because of connection with rent-payer movement unless
                            they had permitted themselves to become involved in improper
                            activities.</p>
                        <p>Beyond maintaining order the American authorities are of course not
                            interfering with the rent strike which is still in progress. The
                            President conferred yesterday with the more important property owners
                            and suggested to them to agree to rescind all recent rent increases and
                            to reduce all rents to a point 10 percent below that prevailing January
                            1st last, the reduction to remain in effect until the next meeting of
                            the National Assembly in September 1927, when remedial legislation can
                            be passed. The form which this legislation will take has not been
                            mentioned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Your attention is called to the case of
                            the so-called “Paraguayan Jewels”. Although the files of your Legation
                            no doubt contain some of the correspondence on this subject, a brief
                            history of the case is given for your information.</p>
                        <p>In 1868, during the war between Paraguay and Argentina and Brazil, a
                            number of persons deposited with our Minister, Mr. Washburn, in Asunción
                            various articles for safe keeping.<note n="1" xml:id="d532fn1">See <ref
                                    target="frus1868p2#pg_817"><hi rend="italic">Diplomatic

                                    target="frus1871#pg_63">63</ref>.</note> Shortly afterwards Mr.
                            Washburn was compelled to leave Asunción and the articles entrusted to
                            him passed through a number of hands before being taken over by the
                            invading Brazilian troops and delivered to the Brazilian authorities.
                            The latter made inventory of the goods which came into their possession
                            and some time later delivered the property to Mr. Partridge, our
                            Minister to Brazil. The box containing these articles eventually reached
                            the State Department, where further inventory was made in 1884,
                            disclosing the fact that the contents of the box at that time was much
                            less than that in 1871 when the Brazilian inventory was made. In 1888
                            the box was forwarded to Mr. Bacon, our Chargé d’Affaires at Montevideo
                            and, after an unsuccessful effort to induce the Paraguayan Government to
                            accept it, the box was deposited at the London and River Plate Bank in
                            Montevideo. On September 3, 1902, Mr. Finch, who was then Minister to
                            Uruguay, inspected the box at the bank, found the inner seal intact, and
                            re-sealed the outer box with the seal of the United States Legation at
                            Montevideo. This action was reported to the Department in the Legation’s
                            despatch No. 576 of September 5, 1902.<note n="2" xml:id="d532fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> Since that date various claimants have endeavored to
                            establish their right to the contents of the box, but have been unable
                            to convince the Department that their claims were well founded.</p>
                        <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0750"/>
                        <p>It is now proposed to endeavor to ascertain what claimants are properly
                            entitled to the articles now remaining in the box and, as a preliminary
                            step, it is deemed desirable to ascertain whether the box is still at
                            the bank and whether its contents are intact.</p>
                        <p>The previous inventories which have been made contain very general
                            descriptions, from which it would be impossible to identify any
                            particular object exactly. It is therefore desired that you secure an
                            adequate inventory of the contents of the box and, for this purpose, it
                            is believed that photographs of each object should be made. You are
                            accordingly instructed to make such an examination and inventory, either
                            at the bank or at the Legation as may seem most suitable and convenient.
                            Especial care should be taken to see that the photographs or other
                            description of the contents of the box do not come into the hands of any
                            one who might pass them on to possible claimants, since it would be an
                            easy matter for any fraudulent claimant in possession of such
                            photographs to make out a strong claim based on an exact description of
                            the articles. It is therefore suggested that the photographs should, if
                            possible, be made by some one connected with the Legation.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that it would also be desirable as an additional
                            precaution to open the box and to make the inventory and photographs in
                            the presence of some reliable notary or official, preferably of the
                            Paraguayan Government, who could certify that all of the articles
                            removed for inspection were replaced in the box. Care must of course be
                            taken in selecting such an individual lest he should improperly pass on
                            to possible claimants the knowledge of the contents of the box which he
                            would gain from such participation in the making of the inventory.
                            Perhaps one of the bank officials would be the most suitable person, but
                            this matter is left to your discretion.</p>
                        <p>When the inventory has been completed and the photographs taken, the
                            articles should be replaced in the box and the box again sealed with the
                            seal of the Legation. It will probably be advisable then to return the
                            box to the bank for safe keeping until further action can be determined
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>You will transmit promptly to the Department duplicate copies of the
                            inventory and of the photographs, retaining copies also in your own
                            files.</p>

                            No. 276, dated January 27, 1925,<note n="3" xml:id="d533fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> in regard to the so-called “Paraguayan Jewels”,
                            there is enclosed for your information a copy of a despatch, No. 395,
                            dated March 9, 1925, from the Legation at Montevideo,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d533fn6">Not printed.</note> together with its enclosures,
                            which you will note contain a complete inventory, with photographs, of
                            the property referred to.</p>
                        <p>The Department believes that it would be extremely difficult, if not
                            impossible, for any living claimants to identify satisfactorily many of
                            the articles contained in the box, which is now at Montevideo. It is
                            therefore believed that the most satisfactory disposition of this
                            property would be to deliver it to the Paraguayan Government, without
                            any responsibility on the part of this Government, in order that the
                            articles maybe disposed of in any manner which seems to them proper.</p>
                        <p>For your information it may be stated that on December 30, 1887, the
                            Department instructed Mr. Bacon, Chargé d’Affaires at Montevideo,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d533fn7">Not printed.</note> to deliver to the
                            Paraguayan Government all of these articles which were then in the
                            possession of this Department, “with a distinct disclaimer of any
                            responsibility”. The box, which was then in the Department, was
                            accordingly sent to Montevideo, but, due to the discrepancy between the
                            inventory which had been made by the Brazilian Government in 1871 and
                            the inventory made by the Department in 1884, the Paraguayan Government
                            refused to accept the delivery of the box and its contents. This
                            information was conveyed to the Department as an enclosure to despatch
                            No. 71 of October 29, 1895, from the Legation at Montevideo.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d533fn8">Not printed.</note> In view of this fact the
                            Department decided to make an effort to return the property to such
                            individual claimants as might be able to establish their right to any of
                            the articles. It was also proposed that if a claim for property be
                            established to articles included in the Brazilian inventory of 1871, but
                            not included in the Department’s inventory of 1884, Congress would be
                            requested to appropriate a sum of money for the indemnification of the
                            claimants. However, no claimant was able to trace his individual
                            property through the various vicissitudes which the box encountered. It
                            is believed by the Department that it would be virtually impossible for
                            any claimant to do so. It may also be noted that possible claimants have
                            had an opportunity to study the inventories of 1871 and 1884 and would
                            thus be in a position to file claims based solely on the descriptions
                            contained in those inventories, thereby opening a fertile <pb n="670"
                                xml:id="pg_670" facs="0752"/>field for fraud. While it might be
                            possible, on the basis of the inventory which is enclosed herewith, to
                            distribute certain articles to bona fide claimants who could identify
                            the objects claimed to your satisfaction, it is obvious that numerous
                            articles could not be so identified and the distribution of this
                            remainder would still present an unsettled problem.</p>
                        <p>You may, in your discretion, point out these difficulties to the
                            Paraguayan Government in an effort to induce that Government to accept
                            the box and contents as it now exists, and to discharge this Government
                            of all responsibility in connection therewith. It might also be pointed
                            out that in January, 1902, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay
                            caused to be published in the <hi rend="italic">Diario</hi>, the
                            official paper of Paraguay, a notice to the effect that all claims
                            relative to this property should be presented within ninety days of the
                            date of the publication of the notice, or be thereafter barred. A copy
                            of this notice was transmitted to the Department in despatch No. 517,
                            dated February 5, 1902, from the Legation at Montevideo.<note n="5"

                        <p>If the Paraguayan Government should still refuse to accept the box, and
                            its contents under the terms outlined above, you will communicate this
                            fact to the Department with any suggestions for the disposal of the
                            property which may occur to you. It may be added that you will of course
                            take care to see that the enclosed inventory, and particularly the
                            photographs, are kept strictly confidential in order that no fraudulent
                            use of them might be made by possible claimants.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department’s instruction No. 290 of
                            April 9, 1925, concerning the so-called Paraguayan jewels has been
                            received and, in accordance therewith, the papers in this case have been
                            gone over. I am of the opinion expressed in the instruction in reference
                            that, due to the impossibility at this late date of a discovery by the
                            Legation of the owners of all the articles, or of their heirs, the best
                            and most equitable procedure will be to hand this box to the Government
                            of Paraguay for such disposition thereof as it may wish to make.</p>
                        <p>In accordance therefore with the Department’s authorization I have taken
                            this matter up with Mr. Bordenave, Minister of Foreign <pb n="671"
                                xml:id="pg_671" facs="0753"/>Affairs, pointing out the changed
                            situation since the refusal of his predecessor, in 1895, to accept this
                            box. I have secured from him his verbal consent to receive the box and
                            relieve the United States Government of all responsibility in connection
                            therewith. The box, I suggested, could be turned over to a
                            representative of the Paraguayan Government in Montevideo. Mr. Bordenave
                            has agreed also to this point.</p>
                        <p>I asked that the above arrangement be confirmed by an exchange of notes,
                            of which copies will be duly furnished the Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your
                            Legation’s despatch No. 1542 of July 1, 1925,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d535fn6">Not printed.</note> in reply to its instruction of
                            April 9 last concerning the Paraguayan jewels and it is noted from the
                            enclosure thereto that the Paraguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs has
                            declined to receive the jewels under the conditions proposed by this
                            Government. In his note of June 30, 1925, he made the following
                            statement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“From the basis of the past files of this Ministry in this
                                    matter, it appears that the inventory which you enclose does not
                                    contain all the objects and valuables described in the various
                                    petitions presented by the claimants, nor those accounted for in
                                    the inventory made in Rio de Janeiro September 14, 1871 and
                                    which bears the signature of the Minister, Mr. James R.
                                    Partridge.</p>
                                <p>“Under these circumstances, my Government would be able to
                                    undertake only the acceptance pure and simple of the
                                    abovementioned objects, but finds itself unable to relieve yours
                                    of claims which it would have no way of preventing, since the
                                    renouncement of property rights is only valid when made by the
                                    actual owners or the holders of their titles.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In reply to the Department’s request for suggestions as to the disposal
                            of this property, Mr. Southworth proposes that the box of jewels be sent
                            to Asunción and that the chief of your mission be authorized to receive
                            and pronounce upon written and verbal claims to any objects deposited
                            with Mr. Washburn and included in the 1871 list subscribed by Mr.
                            Partridge. He suggests that a four months’ period be allowed for
                            presenting such claims, and that, after they have been disposed of, the
                            American representative turn over to the Museo Nacional any articles the
                            ownership of which has not <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0754"/>been
                            established, as the property of the people of Paraguay. It is further
                            suggested that a few small articles which are not suitable for this
                            purpose might be sold and the proceeds thereof applied to the expenses
                            involved in the above plan.</p>
                        <p>The Department deems it desirable, if possible, to dispose of the
                            contents of the box in question at an early date, in order to avoid the
                            inconvenience, expense and embarrassment which will be involved in
                            continuing to act as custodian of these articles. Moreover, after giving
                            the matter further consideration, the Department believes it would be
                            desirable, if possible, to avoid placing upon the Legation the difficult
                            task of distributing the articles in question to the rightful owners. It
                            is believed that the Paraguayan Government will be in a better position
                            than the Legation to make this distribution. Therefore, unless, for some
                            reason not now apparent to the Department, you deem it inadvisable to
                            take this course, the Department authorizes you to address a further
                            communication to the Foreign Minister offering to turn the box and its
                            contents over to him upon the understanding that this action does not
                            affect one way or another the question of the alleged liability of the
                            Government of the United States because of the loss of specie and other
                            articles from the box while it was in the custody of an officer of this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>While it does not seem necessary at the present time to enter into a
                            discussion with the Paraguayan Government of the liability of this
                            Government for the loss of the articles mentioned, I may say that it
                            does not appear to this Department that such liability exists as a
                            matter of law. In this relation attention is called to the following
                            statement of Secretary Fish, in his instruction of January 31, 1871, to
                            Minister Wright:<note n="7" xml:id="d535fn7">Robert Clinton Wright,

                            <p>“Mr. Washburn also says that he warned the depositors that, in

                                neither his Government nor himself personally was to be held
                                accountable for the safe-keeping of the property. This Government
                                claims no right to interfere for the recovery of the value of such

                                attending the trust, and in view of the standing of the depositors,
                                that government might of its own accord make amends to them.” (<ref

                        <p>Attention is also called to the following statement in Mr. Wright’s note
                            of May 4, 1871, to the Brazilian Foreign Minister, concerning the return
                            of the articles in question, which had been taken from the American
                            Legation at Asunción by Brazilian soldiers: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    the United States, it nevertheless appeals to the magnanimity of
                                    the imperial government in behalf of those Paraguayans who had
                                    deposited their property at the American legation. The
                                    Government of the United States goes further, and submits to the
                                    government of Brazil whether the position of this Paraguayan
                                    property, on deposit at the legation of the United States, was
                                    not analogous to that of an enemy’s property on board of a
                                    neutral ship at sea, which is exempt from seizure, under a
                                    principle understood to be respected by the Brazilian
                                    government. As regards the property of the United States, the
                                    property of Mr. John A. Duffield, and of Mr. Washburn, for this
                                    the Government of the United States will, in any event, expect
                                    reparation.” (<ref target="frus1871#pg_46"><hi rend="italic"

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is evident from the statements quoted that custody of the articles in
                            question was undertaken in the first instance by Minister Washburn
                            merely as an act of grace. He accepted this trust upon the express
                            understanding that neither the Government of the United States nor
                            himself would be “held accountable for the safe-keeping of the
                            property.” It is equally clear that Minister Wright took over the
                            articles in question from the Brazilian Government purely as an act of
                            grace, for the benefit of the owners in Paraguay, and without assuming
                            any greater liability than that which had been assumed by Minister
                            Washburn.</p>
                        <p>In case you turn the box and its contents over to the Paraguayan
                            Government, as suggested above, it will be desirable for you to obtain a
                            receipt specifying the articles, for which purpose it is believed the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the
                            Paraguayan jewels have been delivered to the Paraguayan Government,
                            receipt for the same being attached hereto. It is my opinion that this
                            much negotiated incident is now a closed bit of history, for the
                            Paraguayan Government as well as for ourselves, because, it is almost
                            certain that no one can present a Washburn receipt or document
                            substantiating their rightful claim.</p>
                        <p>The jewels were received from Montevideo as reported in my former
                            despatch, No. 44 of February 18, 1926.<note n="10" xml:id="d538fn10">Not
                                printed.</note> Upon their arrival they were placed in the
                            depository of the Legation under lock, and the premises were guarded by
                            Police placed here by the Government.</p>
                        <p>Before the departure of Mr. Hofer, Secretary of Legation at Montevideo,
                            and the individual who had been present at the opening of the box upon a
                            former occasion, making an inventory thereof, the box was again opened
                            in the presence of the duly authorized and qualified agents of the
                            Paraguayan Government, who prepared an inventory in <pb n="675"
                                xml:id="pg_675" facs="0757"/>their own language (copy and
                            translation of which are attached)<note n="11" xml:id="d538fn11">Not
                                printed.</note> and which corresponded exactly with the inventory
                            made at Montevideo. The box was sealed in the presence of the Paraguayan
                            officials, bearing this time the seals of Paraguay and the United
                            States, and placed in the depository awaiting the date of its acceptance
                            by the Paraguayan Government.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my former communication, the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            requested that the same be retained by the Legation until after his
                            return to Asunción. This was done and upon his return and at the request
                            of the Paraguayan Foreign Office the box was then again opened at the
                            Legation in order that an appraisement might be made while under the
                            Legation charge, to withstand or forestall any criticism or insinuation
                            that the items were otherwise than as reported in the inventories or
                            that substitutions thereto had been made by the Paraguayans after
                            delivery by this Legation. This request was granted and the official
                            governmental appraisers called, and, in the presence of the Minister and
                            Sub-Secretary of Foreign Affairs and the official notary of the
                            Paraguayan Government, the appraisement was made (copy and translation
                            of which are also attached).<note n="11" xml:id="d538fn12">Not
                                printed.</note> The box was again closed and sealed as before
                            mentioned and placed in the depository awaiting delivery to the
                            Government. This came about within two days following, the acceptance
                            taking place today by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the receipts
                            signed which are attached to this communication.<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d538fn13">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It is the intention of the Paraguayan authorities to place the jewels
                            within the Oficina de Cambio for the present and perhaps later, if
                            receipts cannot be presented for the articles, to remain a part of the
                            Museum as the memorials of the War.</p>
                        <p>Thus closes the chapter of the long negotiations.</p>

                        <p>77. Medjlis passed following law this afternoon: 80 in favor, 5 against,
                            30 absent. “In the name of the welfare of the people the National
                            Consultative Assembly declares the abolition of the Kajar Sovereignty

                            be later set up by Constituent Assembly. It is, therefore, assumed by
                            the Department that there is not at present any question of formal
                            recognition, and that before that question arises there will be an
                            opportunity to consider further the legal status of the new government

                        <p>55. (1) Should Department’s 53, November 3, not entirely meet exigency as

                            wish to delay its expression of friendliness toward Persia in the
                            present situation. But since, according to your report, the present

                            confirmation of its authority, the Department judged that confirmation
                            might fittingly precede formal recognition by this Government. Any
                            recommendation which you may feel disposed to make will, however,
                            receive the Department’s careful consideration.</p>

                            maintain unofficial relations, but that he cannot consent to official
                            relations until receipt of note like that from Great Britain, which I
                            reported in Legation’s 80, November 3, midnight. Since German and
                            Russian Ministers are this afternoon addressing similar communications
                            to Reza Khan and representatives of other powers will probably do the
                            same immediately, and since such declaration would not bind the United
                            States Government in its attitude toward subsequent government, I
                            suggest instructions from Department to address written note in language
                            desired by Persian Government. [End paraphrase.]</p>

                        <p>5. Department’s No. 2, January 19, noon. I have not made any
                            representations on opium question to Persian Government after those
                            which I reported to Department in my despatches Nos. 652, of September
                            23, and 671, of October 8. Reasons are as follows: (1) Until complete
                            liquidation of Imbrie incident I regarded such discussions as
                            inappropriate. (2) In view of Persia’s contribution to solution of opium
                            problem in form of Colonel MacCormack’s memorandum on Persian
                                opium,<note n="14" xml:id="d552fn14">Memorandum on Persian opium

                        <p>I venture to make following observations with regard to further
                            representations on particular phase of matter mentioned in British note:
                            (1) Between 60 and 70 tons of Indian opium have been sent in bond, in
                            the past 10 months, to Bushire tax-free transshipment. In order to put
                            an end to this traffic, the Council of Ministers issued an order a month
                            ago prohibiting entirely importation of opium into Persia. (2) Colonel
                            MacCormack is of opinion that pending report of opium investigation
                            commission, whose despatch to Persia the League of Nations has suggested
                            (so I am informed) and to which the Persian Government has agreed,
                            further representations are not necessary.</p>

                            the British Mission in Vladivostok has informed the British Government
                            that none of the shipments of opium reported from Bushire as being
                            destined for the port of Vladivostok during the past year has actually
                            arrived there; that the British Government is convinced that, in the
                            case of these consignments, the declaration of Vladivostok as the port
                            of destination is merely a cloak to cover these shipments of opium into
                            China; and that the British Government has instructed its minister in
                            Teheran to make representations to the Persian Government with a view to
                            inducing it to prohibit or to put some check on this traffic, if he is
                            of the opinion that such representations would have any practical or
                            even moral effect. The British Embassy adds that it has been instructed
                            by the British Government to express the hope that the United States
                            Government will be prepared <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0770"/>to
                            instruct its representative at Teheran to concert with the British

                            this matter, in order that by such cooperation the maximum pressure may

                            this traffic. Reference is made in this connection to your despatches

                                xml:id="d558fn21">Neither printed.</note> wherein you refer to the
                            Legation’s recent representations to the Persian Government regarding
                            the control of opium traffic from Persian Gulf ports and to certain
                            supplementary information furnished you in this connection by the
                            British Minister to Persia. The report, that shipments of opium to the
                            Far East have been diverted from the port of arrival indicated in the
                            covering shipping documents and have been smuggled into China, is
                            partially substantiated by despatches which have reached the Department
                            from certain of its officers in China. You are directed, therefore, to
                            address a further communication to the Persian Government referring to
                            your previous notes and to the Persian Government’s replies in this
                            matter. In such further representations, the exact nature of which the
                            Department desires to leave in a large measure to your discretion, you
                            should state that, subsequent to such exchanges of notes, your
                            Government has received credible information from certain of its
                            representatives in China and from other sources to the effect that opium
                            shipped from the Persian Gulf has been diverted from its ostensible
                            destination and has been smuggled into China. You may refer again to the
                            efforts of the Persian and American Governments to assist in the
                            regulation of the world traffic in this drug and in keeping it within
                            the limits of legitimate enterprise. In conclusion you should state that
                            your Government, actuated by a spirit of friendly cooperation, has
                            authorized you to bring to the attention of the Persian Government the
                            situation outlined above and that your Government, in order that the
                            joint efforts of the two Governments may be most effective, has
                            expressed the earnest hope that the Persian Government will in due
                            course inform you of such steps as it may have been able to take or of
                            such further steps as it may contemplate taking to investigate and
                            correct this situation. You may orally inform your British colleague of
                            the action taken by you in this matter.</p>

                            conversations held at Washington on behalf of the Government of the
                            United States and the Government of the Republic of Poland with

                            Governments have informally expressed themselves.</p>
                        <p>These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two
                            Governments which is that, in respect to import, export and other duties

                            warehousing and other facilities and the treatment of commercial
                            travelers’ samples, the United States will accord to Poland and Poland
                            will accord to the United States, its territories and possessions,
                            unconditional most-favored-nation treatment; and that in the matter of
                            licensing or prohibitions of imports or exports, the United States and
                            Poland, respectively, so far as they at any time maintain such a system,
                            will accord to the commerce of the other treatment as favorable, with
                            respect to commodities, valuations and quantities, as may be accorded to

                            statement of my understanding of the agreement reached through recent
                            conversations held at Washington on behalf of the Government of the
                            Republic of Poland and the Government of the United States with
                            reference to the treatment which Poland shall accord to the commerce of
                            the United States and which the United States shall accord to the
                            commerce of Poland pending the negotiation of a comprehensive treaty of
                            friendship, commerce and consular rights to which the Governments of
                            both countries have given careful attention and in favor of which both

                            warehousing and other facilities and the treatment of commercial
                            travelers’ samples, Poland will accord to the United States, its
                            territories and possessions, and the United States will accord to
                            Poland, unconditional most-favored-nation treatment; and that in the
                            matter of licensing or prohibitions of imports or exports, Poland and
                            the United States respectively, so far as they at any time maintain such
                            a system, will accord to the commerce of the other treatment as
                            favorable, with respect to commodities, valuations and quantities, as

                        <p>In 1922 the Sinclair Oil Company entered into a contract with the Far
                            Eastern Republic for an oil concession in Northern Sakhalin, being that
                            part of the island claimed by Russia. The Soviet Government insisted
                            that the concession required ratification by it and a supplemental
                            agreement was made on January 23, 1923, confirming the grant but
                            providing certain conditions making the concession dependent upon the
                            attitude of the American Government toward the Soviet regime and toward
                            the concession granted by it. One of these specifically provides that
                            the concession might be cancelled at the end <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698"
                                facs="0780"/>of the fifth year after the date of the signing of the
                            supplemental agreement, to wit, January 23, 1923, if normal official
                            relations had not been resumed between the United States of America and
                            the Far Eastern Republic in the form of a judicial recognition
                            (recognition <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>). It is unnecessary to go
                            into the long history of this matter as presented to the State
                            Department by the Sinclair Oil Company and the State Department’s reply.
                            It is sufficient to say that the Japanese Government, whose military
                            forces have occupied Northern Sakhalin, declined to permit the employees
                            of the Sinclair Oil Company to enter Northern Sakhalin for the purpose
                            of exploration and development. The Sinclair Company appealed to the
                            State Department asking the assistance of the United States Government
                            to carry out its contract. The State Department declined on the ground
                            that this Government had never recognized the Far Eastern Republic or
                            the Soviet Government and, therefore, could not make any representations
                            to that Government in relation to the contract.</p>
                        <p>The Sinclair Oil Company later claimed that Japan had entered into a
                            treaty with Russia whereby the Japanese troops were to be removed by the
                            fifteenth of May, 1925, and the ownership and control of Northern
                            Sakhalin was conceded to the Soviet Government<note n="3"

                            as for the other fifty per cent the Soviet Union decided to offer such

                                <p>“In conclusion, the Japanese Delegation is authorized to declare
                                    that it is the fixed and settled policy of Japan to respect the
                                    territorial integrity of Russia, and to observe the principle of
                                    nonintervention in the internal affairs of that country, as well
                                    as the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and
                                    industry of all nations in every part of the Russian
                                    possessions.”</p>

                        <p>There are two answers to these propositions. In the first place, any
                            representations this Government should make would necessitate a support
                            of the contract made between Sinclair Company and a Government which the
                            United States has not recognized, a protest to the Soviet Government
                            which we are not in a position to make. Second, it is extremely doubtful
                            whether the concession is in violation of the declaration of the
                            Japanese Delegation. Under the treaty between the Nine Powers as to
                                China,<note n="6" xml:id="d563fn6"><ref target="frus1922v01#pg_271"

                            the development or exploration of fifty per cent of the oil bearing
                            territory in a given province in China was granted to the American
                                corporation,<note n="7" xml:id="d563fn7">Concession by the Province

                            In any event, in my opinion, we cannot support a contract between
                            American nationals and a Government which we have not recognized. The
                            Sinclair Company and all other nationals enter into contracts with the
                            Russian Government with the full knowledge that they take their own risk
                            and that they will not receive the support of this Government.</p>

                                    Soviet Government as between those parties I did not think the
                                    question was material to any action which the State Department
                                    had been or should be asked to take. He fully agreed with me as
                                    to this.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Generally I admitted to be correct the statement that a mere
                                    military occupation of foreign territory did not give the
                                    occupant the right to dispose of real estate or make permanent
                                    concessions, that I did not understand that Japan had done this.
                                    It might be true, or it likely was, that the concessions
                                    promised by the Soviet Government were induced by the wish of
                                    that Government to obtain the military evacuation by the
                                    Japanese in Northern Sakhalin but the concessions promised, if
                                    made to Japanese concerns or the Japanese Government, could not,
                                    of course, be considered on the basis of the military occupation
                                    but would depend entirely upon the right of the Soviet
                                    Government to dispose of rights in its own territory. He
                                    acquiesced in this position.</item>

                                <item>That in my opinion the clauses in the supplementary contract
                                    signed by the Soviet Government and the Sinclair Company
                                    relative to protection of Sinclair’s rights in the United States
                                    and giving the Soviet Government the right to cancel the
                                    contract if that Government was not recognized by the United
                                    States within five years, were placed there for the purpose of
                                    using the Sinclair Company to influence the United States and
                                        [<hi rend="italic">to?</hi>] grant such recognition. He
                                    admitted this to be true and said this agreement was forced from
                                    Sinclair by the Soviet Government. I did not dispute this but
                                    told him that nevertheless the fact remained the contract was
                                    made for this purpose and that was a question of public policy
                                    which did have a bearing upon the action this Department should
                                    take in protecting the Sinclair Company’s rights. This he
                                    admitted and frankly conceded that the Department should not
                                    recognize the Soviet Government and could not and should not
                                    protest to that Government for the protection of the Sinclair
                                    Company’s rights. He said that Sinclair’s contract had been
                                    cancelled by the Soviet Courts, that there was no possibility of
                                    the rights being reinstated by the present Government in Russia
                                    and, therefore, there was no present necessity of taking any
                                    action.</item>

                                <item>I then discussed with him the Japanese declaration at the
                                    Washington Conference, also the Chinese Treaty for equal rights
                                    in China, and said that the Department had taken the position
                                    that a grant of fifty per cent, of a certain territory was not
                                    denying equal rights within China in violation of the Chinese
                                    Treaty, that I was not prepared to say that the promises made by
                                    the Soviet Government to grant to Japanese concerns or the
                                    Japanese Government certain rights of exploration and fifty per
                                    cent, of the described territory was in violation of the
                                    Japanese declaration. In any event, I did not think it wise at
                                    present to make any protest to the Japanese Government in view
                                    of the fact that the Sinclair concessions had been cancelled by
                                    the courts of the Soviet Government. He acquiesced in this and
                                    suggested that the only thing he expected was that if there
                                    should be a change of Government in Russia and the new
                                    Government should come to the conclusion that an injustice had
                                    been done to the Sinclair Company and were prepared to make a
                                    concession to it, that we should lay the facts before the
                                    Japanese Government and ask, if such occasion should arise, that
                                    the Sinclair Company be given an equal opportunity to obtain
                                    concessionary rights and without opposition of the Japanese
                                    Government. He did not desire to write me a letter asking for it
                                    at present and thought that possibly I could take the matter up
                                    with the Japanese Government, not with a view to obtaining any
                                    immediate action by that Government but should the Sinclair
                                    Company in the future some time try to get a reasonable
                                    concession, he thought that it would be <pb n="701"
                                        xml:id="pg_701" facs="0783"/>well to file some sort of a
                                    notice to Japan so that the Japanese Government could not claim
                                    that we knew all about it and had never made any protest. This
                                    seemed to be a very reasonable attitude and, of course, we wish
                                    to do everything we can to protect the legitimate interests of
                                    the Sinclair Company when those interests are entirely divorced
                                    from any agreement to obtain recognition of Russia. I suggest
                                    that at the proper time a memorandum be prepared reviewing the
                                    history of the whole transaction and informing our Ambassador of
                                    the situation so that he can informally take the matter up with
                                    the Japanese Government.</item>

                            Article 15 of the Armistice and Article 259 (6) of the Treaty of

                        <p>In reply, permit me to invite your attention to the provisions of

                            particularly to recall the considerations set forth in the note
                            addressed by the Acting Secretary of State on June 30, 1920, to His
                            Excellency, The Eight Honorable Sir Auckland Geddes,<note n="13"
                                xml:id="d567fn13">Note not printed.</note> in regard to the proposal
                            put forward at that time by the British and French Governments to apply
                            the gold in question to redeem a part of the Anglo-French loan of 1915.
                            You will note that in that communication this Government observed that
                            the proposal seemed to involve a question of doubtful right respecting
                            the use of property held in trust for Russia, and that the propriety of
                            disposing of these funds on the sole <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703"
                                facs="0785"/>authority of Powers which stood in the position of
                            trustees and for their own benefit deserved serious consideration. Mr.
                            Norman Davis also referred to the possible interest of the United States
                            as a creditor of Russia, and stated that the Government of the United
                            States would be glad if consideration might be given to the suggestions
                            set forth in his communication before further action were taken with
                            respect to this fund.</p>
                        <p>Since the action reported in your note under acknowledgment appears to be
                            at variance with the views of this Government heretofore communicated to
                            Your Excellency’s Government, this Government must fully reserve its
                            position with respect to the action taken and its rights in the
                            premises.</p>

                        <p>I then reminded Señor Espinosa of his promise of last Thursday to furnish
                            me with a definite reply to the Department’s Note aforementioned within
                            three days. I also inquired whether he had obtained the opinion of the
                            Treaty Board of the Council of State regarding the proposal contained in
                            the Department’s Note, a copy of which I had handed him in my interview
                            of the preceding week. Señor Espinosa replied that both he and the
                            Treaty Board held the opinion which he had expressed to me on the 2nd.
                            instant, (see my telegram No. 9, April 2, 4 P.M.),<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d573fn4">Not printed.</note> to wit: that Spain could not
                            entertain, even for thirty days, a proposal which violated the Spanish
                            law against making reductions in excess of 20% below the second column
                            of the Spanish customs tariff. He added that he was sending telegraphic
                            instructions in this sense to Ambassador Riaño at Washington in order to
                            enable him to reply immediately to the Department’s Note of December
                            5th, last. Señor Espinosa then said that as it had been intimated to him
                            that the Government of the United States would not consider any
                            treatment less favorable than that accorded at present to England,
                            France, Italy, Switzerland, and Norway, all of which were receiving
                            concessions in the form of duties lower than 20% below the second
                            column, he doubted that a treaty could be made at this time. He
                            intimated, nevertheless, that his Government might <pb n="708"

                        <p>13. After numerous conferences I have received the following proposition
                            from Admiral Magaz, Acting President Military Directorate: <quote

                                <p>“In an interview recently held with the Assistant Secretary of
                                    State, Your Excellency referred to a note of your Government
                                    dated December 5, 1924, in which the proposition was made to His
                                    Majesty’s Government that a commercial agreement of temporary
                                    nature be negotiated between the United States and Spain pending
                                    the arrangement of a new commercial treaty between the two
                                    countries, a temporary agreement based on unconditional
                                    reciprocal favored-nation treatment. The Assistant Secretary
                                    having explained to Your Excellency the reasons of a legal
                                    nature that prevent the Government of His Majesty from agreeing
                                    to negotiate on that basis, which the Ambassador of His Catholic
                                    Majesty at Washington has been instructed to communicate to the
                                    North American Government, Your Excellency suggested to the
                                    Acting Foreign Minister as a subsidiary solution that the
                                    commercial regime in effect, which will terminate May 5th next,
                                    be extended.</p>

                                    to the suggestion of Your Excellency in this respect agrees to
                                    accept in principle that solution; but at the same time, in view
                                    of the great injury to so important a factor of Spanish
                                    production as the grapes of Almeria that has been and continues

                        <p>11. Your No. 13. April 17, 4 p.m. The Department notes that the Spanish
                            Government would be willing to continue the present commercial
                            arrangement for another period of one year if this Government should be
                            favorably inclined to re-examine the situation with respect to the
                            importation of Almeria grapes.</p>
                        <p>The present arrangement is not entirely satisfactory to this Government
                            (1) because of the necessity for renewal of the agreement periodically,
                            and (2) because of the fact that this Government is not entitled under
                            the agreement, to claim for American products imported into Spain the
                            benefit of reductions made by Spain in agreements entered into with
                            other Governments subsequent to November 5, 1923, the date on which the
                            present arrangement first became operative, while the United States on
                            its part is according to all Spanish products most-favored-nation
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>While the Department cannot admit that the situation with respect to
                            grapes has any proper bearing on the commercial relationship, it is
                            considering the suggestion that this Government should re-examine the
                            situation with respect to the importation of Almeria grapes and desires
                            that meanwhile you should endeavor to obtain the following information:
                            (1) whether the Spanish Government would be willing to continue the
                            commercial arrangement indefinitely after the expiration of one year,
                            subject to termination on three months’ notice, or upon the conclusion
                            of a treaty of commerce, and (2) whether it would be willing to accord
                            to the United States, upon request through your Embassy, the benefits of
                            any tariff concessions which have been made to any other country since
                            November 5, 1923, or which may hereafter be made with respect to any
                            article of interest to the trade of the United States.</p>

                        <p>17. Department’s number 13, April 28, 3 p.m.<note n="6" xml:id="d576fn6"
                                >Not printed.</note> After numerous conferences with the Foreign
                            Office urging prompt action, I was informed last night by Acting Foreign
                            Minister that he favored and believed that he could induce the Treaty
                            Board to agree to an indefinite extension of present commercial
                            arrangement. He said definitely that the Spanish Government could grant
                            no new concessions of any kind to any government and suggested that in
                            the proposed exchange of notes the following phraseology be used: “it is
                            agreed that the present arrangement shall not end on May 5th next but
                            shall continue in force indefinitely subject to termination upon 3
                            months’ notice by either party.”</p>
                        <p>When I urged full acceptance of the Department’s proposal the Acting
                            Minister pointed out that personally neither he nor the Treaty Board had
                            much objection, saying there were only two or three smaller items which
                            would be affected but that legal restrictions prevented them from making
                            now or in future any new reductions under 20 percent below the second
                            column.</p>
                        <p>Our commercial attaché informs me that the only item of commercial
                            importance to the United States is crude sulphur, Italy and Germany
                            paying 27 pesetas the 100 kilos and the United States 30 pesetas; other
                            advantages he states are few and are of little or no importance.</p>
                        <p>I believe if I insisted I could obtain prorogation one year and
                            indefinitely thereafter if the Department desired it, but Spanish
                            officials would prefer indefinite arrangement with a 3 months’ clause
                            without any time specified. I have been promised official answer in a
                            couple of days. Treaty Board meets today. Please instruct whether
                            procedure suggested in first paragraph is satisfactory.</p>

                                    to other countries subsequently to November 5, 1923 and of those
                                    which may be compounded [<hi rend="italic">conceded</hi>]
                                    hereafter, the Ministry of State has to inform the Embassy that
                                    there is no legal possibility of such action because,
                                    independently of the slight importance which such a concession
                                    may hold for the United States, and which it might be disposed
                                    to grant, the fact of doing so would imply agreement to
                                    something contrary to the existing arrangement.</p>
                                <p>It would be a question therefore of a new agreement, and even if
                                    such an unimportant concession were included therein, several of
                                    the present concessions, could not be granted as new
                                    concessions, since, as they are reductions in excess of 20
                                    percent below the second column of the customs tariff, they
                                    would be illegal under the present law and they can continue in
                                    force only in case they are concessions granted prior to the
                                    expiration of the law of April 22, 1922.”</p>

                            formerly granted for entry to this country of Spanish oranges under the
                            “general” clause on page 2 of amendment 4 of Plant Quarantine 56,<note
                                n="12" xml:id="d581fn12">An embargo on the importation of oranges,

                                fly was present (including the Spanish province of Almeria), was
                                laid by the Federal Horticultural Board in 1923 in Plant Quarantine
                                No. 56. Amendment 4 was issued Feb. 6, 1925.</note> conditional upon

                            by injurious insects, including fruit flies and melon flies. However,
                            last year it was found that Spanish oranges were in fact quite heavily
                            infested with the Mediterranean fruit fly and in consequence further
                            permits were refused and the importers were notified accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Agriculture states that the importations under permit
                            were very trivial amounting to a few shipments of Seville oranges per
                            year for the use of two small marmalade factories near New York and that
                            practically none of the principal crop of Spanish oranges grown about
                            Valencia ever came to this country even when importation was
                            unrestricted.</p>
                        <p>[Paraphrase.] The concluding sentence of your telegram seems to indicate
                            that the Spanish Government may have under consideration steps which
                            might prove harmful to American interests in Spain as a method of
                            influencing the American Government’s attitude regarding Plant
                            Quarantine 56, especially in connection with the importation of Almerian

                            tell Your Excellency of the unpleasant surprise and deep regret with
                            which my Government has heard of the decision of the Department of
                            Agriculture of the United States to include the oranges of Spanish
                            origin in the prohibition already declared against the Almeria grapes on
                            sanitary grounds.</p>
                        <p>I am also instructed to represent to Your Excellency that the measures
                            taken by the growers against the parasites which have caused the
                            prohibition are serious and effective, as may have been found by the
                            official investigation commissions sent to Spain, and that the exclusion
                            from the United States does injury to the Spanish orange not only on
                            account of the market in this country but also the good name of the
                            merchandise in the other markets; and the Government of His Majesty
                            understands that the application of such measures is not in keeping with
                            the spirit of benevolence on the part of Spain with regard to the
                            imports of iron, machinery, and automobiles, from the United States, nor
                            the interest personally evinced by the President of the Council of
                            Ministers of Spain in intervening in favor of American petroleum,
                            notwithstanding the commercial balance which is very much against
                            us.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Government regards this as a matter of capital importance on
                            account of the effect it works on national economics outside of the
                            consideration of the duties by themselves, as it brings discredit on the
                            Spanish fruits that enjoy world-wide fame.</p>
                        <p>I am also under instructions to declare to Your Excellency that the
                            Government of His Majesty would be very much grieved if it were put in

                                >p.m.</hi>] was prompted by the following personal letter, which I
                            received from General Primo de Rivera, December 9th: <quote

                                <p>“My dear friend: With surprise and extreme regret I learn that
                                    the Department of Agriculture of the United States of North
                                    America has decided to extend to the Spanish orange the embargo
                                    it has established on Almeria grapes for reasons of health.</p>
                                <p>It is not necessary to record all the measures taken against
                                    field parasites by the Almerian cultivators nor the favorable
                                    findings in their behalf resulting from the two visits of the
                                    North American officials sent over. The new regulation is so
                                    depreciatory to a Spanish product of world-wide renown, and one
                                    cultivated with such care as to render it preferable to the same
                                    product of competing countries, that I neither can nor should
                                    permit this action to pass unnoticed, calling the attention of
                                    the United States to the measures we will be forced to take in
                                    consonance therewith, although much to our regret and only as an
                                    obligatory response to an economic policy manifestly hardly
                                    favorable to Spain.</p>
                                <p>And this is so much the more regrettable since our oranges are
                                    not sent to America, it being evident therefore to your
                                    sagacious intelligence that the decision in question tends to
                                    discredit the Spanish Mediterranean orange in all the markets it
                                    commands at present, thus favoring international competition of
                                    a commercial order the details of which it is not necessary to
                                    state at this time nor the trend of the decision reached by your
                                    Department of Agriculture, and which I truly lament.</p>
                                <p>It is of further interest in the case to note that our commercial
                                    balance with the United States is extremely unfavorable to us,
                                    and, notwithstanding this, the Spanish Government not only
                                    interposes no impediment but facilitates economic interchange as
                                    far as possible, as is plainly demonstrated by the increase that
                                    has taken place in a short time of imports of American iron
                                    wares, machinery, and automobiles, while [at] the same time we
                                    observe how the figures of our exports to your country decrease
                                    daily, more especially as regards certain items such as grapes,
                                    canned sardines, wines, etc., which are practically the basis of
                                    our foreign trade with North America.</p>
                                <p>I wish, Mr. Ambassador, that you would meditate upon the facts
                                    stated herein and especially the differences in crowns [<hi

                        <p>Please advise the Department whether Primo de Rivera actually made this
                            statement, and if so, report the circumstances under which it was
                            issued. In particular, state whether at the time of its issuance the

                            by this Department, as the embargo has been in force for 8 months
                            without protest, nor is it understood why Primo de Rivera should have
                            issued a public statement before any answer had been given to the formal

                                has been the daily proof of the good will of the people of the
                                United States toward Spain, manifested not only through its
                                benevolent expressions of Ambassador Moore, who leaves behind him
                                such pleasing reminiscences among Spaniards, but also by the
                                presence of the American sailors at Cartagena and Cadiz, where
                                there, in union with ours, they rendered tribute to those heroes who
                                a little over a quarter of a century ago, struggled so nobly and
                                honorably in the battles of Cavite in the Philippines and in
                                Santiago in Cuba.</p>
                            <p>We responded to this attitude by according preferential commercial
                                treatment to imports from the United States, and especially by
                                favorable treatment of the tourists whose numbers we saw with
                                pleasure increasing daily.</p>
                            <p>But a certain incident—undoubtedly the off-spring of ill
                                interpretation—has caused some distrust to grow in the minds of
                                Spanish producers concerning the truth of these affections they held
                                in such high esteem.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the dry law, which causes such great damage to
                                wine-producing countries such as Spain, we have nothing to observe
                                in view of the fact that the question concerns a measure of a
                                general character which the United States by virtue of its
                                sovereignty saw fit to pass, but there followed the dry law certain
                                hindrances regarding the importation of Almeria grapes, which had a
                                preferential market in the United States. These obstructions were
                                founded upon the presence of the Mediterranean fly and the
                                possibility that the grapes might be infested thereby. Within the
                                intervention of experts from the United States and absorbing care on
                                the part of the Almeria producers it [has] been proved that the
                                vineyards in the province of Almeria—where all kinds of measures had
                                been taken both in the cultivation and production and in the packing
                                and transportation in order that the grapes originating there might
                                be presented in the world—are absolutely free from that fly.</p>
                            <p>We have achieved nothing in favor of our products, on the contrary
                                the prohibition has been extended on the same pretext to the Spanish
                                orange, which had no great market in the United States, but which
                                was indicated in this manner as being infected without <pb n="719"

                                motive of alarm in other markets which have a great consumption of
                                this fruit, which nowhere is so carefully cultivated and of such

                                of Spain. Unhappily for us this is not so, and for every million
                                dollars of goods exported to the United States we receive thence
                                more than $10,000,000. We pay for it with good dollars, a fact which
                                with the present high rate of exchange means considerable sacrifices
                                for Spain.</p>
                            <p>Everyone knows Spain imports from the United States cotton, petroleum
                                products, automobiles and machinery, and if of the first named it
                                may be said that we import it through peremptory necessity for our
                                manufactories of cotton cloths, petroleum products, automobiles and
                                various kinds of machinery are being constantly offered to us under
                                competitive conditions by other countries, the importation of the
                                products of which, if given preference, would diminish by many
                                millions of dollars the commerce of the United States with
                                Spain.</p>
                            <p>This admonition cannot constitute a menace for we well know that by
                                comparison of the volume of the exportations of the United States
                                with its commerce with Spain it means relatively little; this is an
                                appeal for justice to the United States not to forget the favorable
                                treatment she owes to our products in compensation for the many of
                                her products we consume.</p>
                            <p>Moreover the United States must always reserve for Spain an intimate
                                spiritual relationship. Spain is the mother of all Spanish-America;
                                there our blood, our venturesome frank character, our culture and
                                our tradition are sown. The United States and the new American
                                people, inspired by a race other than Spanish, have predominated the
                                American continent and are the guide and example of those peoples,
                                but the United States, neither in America nor the Philippines, can
                                ever do without the seed which Spain left in those lands. Only
                                united with Spain in the diffusion of culture and in a reciprocity
                                of interests can America establish her true racial type and achieve
                                reciprocity sentiments which will give still greater strength and
                                influence to the American race.</p>
                            <p>Besides Spain, more or less in an effective way holds the
                                preponderant place in the straits connecting the Atlantic and the
                                Mediterranean, which gives her an efficacious value in world affairs
                                that <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0802"/>the United States
                                should always seek to have on her side in case of an eventual
                                attempt to cut the communications between those two seas.</p>
                            <p>The Foundation in Madrid protected by the Rockefellers, the
                                participation of Spain in the sesquicentennial exposition at
                                Philadelphia and that of the United States in the Seville Fair, the
                                safety of travel in Spain on the highways, which is becoming better
                                daily and the welcome which the American tourist receives should
                                persuade the United States to which $500,000 in its commercial
                                balance is insignificant, not to rupture any interchange of products
                                which today exists between the both countries, but on the contrary
                                to stimulate reciprocal commerce more and more each day.</p>
                            <p>We well know that the people of the United States, who are a
                                spiritual people, follow with the greatest interest the political
                                evolution of Spain, which is trying to free her people of the
                                disturbances and confusions toward which they were being borne by a
                                system of wornout politics carried on by professional parties,
                                unreinforced by elements taken from the great educational production
                                or labor centres.</p>
                            <p>The people of the United States also follow with interest the noble
                                and firm determination with which Spain is attempting to fulfill in
                                Africa her civilizing mission; and esteem the value, tradition and
                                history of a people of such great nobility as ours. Therefore it
                                should not be difficult to cultivate between both nations the
                                relations which until now have been so well directed and which only
                                this small cloud of opposition to the admittance of our fruits has
                                been able slightly to cool.</p>
                            <p>It is convenient for Spain in these days to be visited by the
                                greatest possible number of foreigners in order that they appreciate
                                the tranquility and order in which the country lives, as well as the
                                prosperity of the industries, the progress and the work. To
                                facilitate this the Government is preparing tourist itineraries.
                                Travelers will find good hotels, guides, facilities for hiring
                                automobiles and magnificent highways for travel by motor. Thus every
                                foreigner who visits us returns to his country a witness and
                                propagator of the beauty and good order of Spain, of the love of the
                                people for their King and the respect they bear their
                                Government.</p>

                        <p>85. Department’s telegram 78. From all I can gather the statement of
                            Primo de Rivera for the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> was made
                            after he sent <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0803"/>his letter of
                            protest to me and after I explained to him personally that no personal
                            offense was intended, that all matters in relation to embargoes were
                            made by the Federal Horticultural Board under the Department of
                            Agriculture, and that the Department of State, or Congress, or even the
                            President, had no control over the matter.</p>
                        <p>For the Department’s information. Personally did not know that there was
                            any embargo on oranges until I received Primo de Rivera’s letter. There
                            was published in a couple of Madrid newspapers a few days before I
                            received Primo de Rivera’s letter a news item that such an embargo had
                            been placed on Spanish oranges, but my impression then was that these
                            press notices were the work of some interests unfriendly to the United
                            States. All these notices have been sent to the Department in the
                            Embassy’s weekly reports recently. My personal opinion is that the
                            Spanish Government did not know of this embargo until these press
                            notices appeared and, as I understand it, the protest was only made
                            after a number of orange growers a few days previously called on the
                            Premier to protest against the embargo. I am positive that if the
                            Spanish Government had known of this embargo 8 months ago, it would
                            certainly have made a protest then, because I have seldom met either an
                            official or a fruit grower that has not protested against the grape
                            proposition.</p>
                        <p rend="center">[Paraphrase]</p>
                        <p>I am not able to answer specifically the last paragraph of the
                            Department’s telegram No. 75 of December 12, 3 p.m., inasmuch as the
                            Spanish Government has given no direct indication of its intentions
                            except the contents of Primo de Rivera’s letter, of which I cabled the
                            text to the Department on December 13th. It is my opinion that if the
                            orange embargo could be lifted and the orange situation restored to its
                            former condition the Spaniards might disregard the grape embargo. The
                            chief Spanish grievance appears to be that although practically no
                            oranges are exported to the United States, the American embargo hurts
                            them in other markets.</p>
                        <p>I explained to them in detail that the Mediterranean fruit fly had been
                            discovered in the grapes and in the oranges as well and that the embargo
                            had been imposed solely for sanitary reasons, and gave them my assurance
                            that these were the sole and only reasons. I likewise gave my assurance
                            to Primo de Rivera that the American Government was willing at all times
                            to assist them in every way not inconsistent with our laws. One thing
                            with which they have been impressed and which is hard to get out of
                            their minds is that the California fruit growers are responsible for all
                            this. I have done everything possible to remove this idea, but for some
                            reason it is impossible to convince them. I do not believe that the
                            Spanish Government <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0804"/>will do
                            anything under any circumstances before the whole question has been
                            thoroughly gone over. When I arrive in Washington about January 10th, I
                            shall explain the whole situation in person. I feel sure that the
                            Spanish Government will take no definite action in the meantime and it
                            is my opinion that the matter can be ironed out.</p>

                            regarding the embargo imposed upon the importation of Spanish oranges
                            into this country.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to inform you that following consultation with the
                            Department of Agriculture, I am now in receipt of a letter from the
                            Secretary of Agriculture, dated January 29, 1926, explaining the action
                            of the Federal Horticultural Board in refusing to issue further permits
                            for the entry of Spanish oranges into this country. This letter reads in
                            substance as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“From reports transmitted to me by your Department, it is evident
                                    that there is a wide misunderstanding in Spain with respect to
                                    the restrictions enforced on account of risk from the
                                    Mediterranean fruit fly on the entry of Spanish oranges. These
                                    reports indicate that the idea obtains that action has recently
                                    been taken against Spain embargoing this fruit. The
                                    misconception which is the basis for this point of view is
                                    explained in the following statement summarizing the action of
                                    this Department restricting the entry of oranges and other
                                    fruits from foreign countries.</p>

                                    flies and other fruit pests, all foreign fruits other than as to
                                    a restricted list were forbidden entry into the United States,
                                    with minor exceptions as to certain countries. The list of
                                    fruits open to entry from all countries, and the exceptions as
                                    to certain countries with respect to other fruits, are indicated
                                    in Regulation 2 under the quarantine. As to citrus fruit, this
                                    action excluded all such fruit other than lemons and sour limes
                                    from all Mediterranean countries and South Africa, as well as
                                    from certain Central and South American countries, and, in
                                    general, trans-Pacific countries, in all of which dangerous
                                    fruit fly enemies were known to exist. This action was in line
                                    with restrictions long enforced against our own Territory of
                                    Hawaii on account of the establishment there of the
                                    Mediterranean fruit fly, except that the restrictions on
                                    Hawaiian fruit are even, more drastic than those <pb n="723"
                                        xml:id="pg_723" facs="0805"/>established for foreign
                                    countries, and is in line with the existing action with respect
                                    to several of our States for the prevention of spread of
                                    dangerous fruit and crop pests.</p>
                                <p>The conditional entry of a certain type of Spanish orange was
                                    later authorized under an amendment to Regulation 2 of the
                                    Quarantine. This amendment, issued before the effective date
                                    (November 1, 1923) of the quarantine, added a paragraph entitled
                                    ‘General’, for the purpose of making provision for the entry of
                                    ‘such specialties as hothouse-grown fruits or other special
                                    fruits, which can be accepted by the United States Department of
                                    Agriculture as free from risk of carrying injurious insects,
                                    including fruit flies.’ Under this paragraph permits were later
                                    issued to two importers in the United States for the entry, for
                                    marmalade manufacture, of a bitter orange from southern Spain,
                                    under the condition that the fruit should be so carefully
                                    selected as to come to the United States free from infestation
                                    with fruit flies, and that it should go immediately into
                                    manufacture under adequate controls.</p>
                                <p>It will be noted that in issuing permits for this type of orange
                                    from Spain, involving, it is true, very inconsiderable imports,
                                    this was making an exception in favor of Spain to the general
                                    restriction on the entry of oranges from Mediterranean
                                    countries. Unfortunately, with the importations of the winter of
                                    1924–25, the shipments of these oranges showed heavy infestation
                                    with the Mediterranean fruit fly. Such infestation evidently
                                    resulted from the fact that to secure the brilliant coloring
                                    which gives the particular merit to these oranges for marmalade
                                    manufacture, it is necessary to leave them on the trees until
                                    they become overripe, giving this fruit fly unusual opportunity
                                    to infest them. As already stated, the entry of these oranges
                                    was conditioned on their being so selected as to be free from
                                    such infestation, and, therefore, this status of affairs led to
                                    the revoking of the permits which were issued to the two
                                    American importers referred to. It will be noted that this
                                    involved no new quarantine action against Spain whatsoever, but
                                    was merely the reversal of a special privilege which had been
                                    given to Spanish exporters under certain conditions, which,
                                    unfortunately, could not apparently be fulfilled, and again
                                    placed Spain on an equality with other Mediterranean countries.

                                <p>Another phase of the Spanish orange situation was brought to the
                                    attention of the Federal Horticultural Board in a personal
                                    interview last November by Sr. Fernando Silvela, Agricultural
                                    Adviser of the Spanish Government in Washington, who submitted
                                    an inquiry from a Canadian importer as to whether table oranges
                                    grown in the general Valencia district of Spain would be
                                    permitted entry at New York for immediate transportation and
                                    exportation in bond to Canada. The first decision of the
                                    specialists of the Department was adverse to such entry and Sr.
                                    Silvela was so advised under date of November 24, 1925.</p>
                                <p>This question of the entry of oranges from Spain and certain
                                    other countries for immediate transportation and exportation in
                                    bond to Canada was later given reconsideration, resulting in a
                                    general ruling <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0806"/>that
                                    such fruit would be permitted entry at New York or other
                                    designated northern ports during the winter months of December,
                                    January and February, if found on inspection at the port of
                                    entry to be apparently free from fruit fly infestation. This
                                    action was taken under the general provision made by the
                                    Department with respect to any of its plant quarantines for the
                                    entry of prohibited or restricted plant products for immediate
                                    export or for immediate transportation and exportation in bond,
                                    when it can be shown that such entry and movement through the
                                    United States can be so safeguarded as to eliminate risk to the
                                    plant cultures of this country (see Immediate Export
                                    Regulations, copy enclosed).<note n="17" xml:id="d586fn17">Not

                                <p>This ruling as applying to Valencia oranges was based on the
                                    advice that this orange ripens about the end of the year, at a
                                    season when the fruit fly is comparatively inactive, and is,
                                    therefore, little, if any, infested by the fly prior to the
                                    spring or summer following.</p>
                                <p>It is respectfully requested that this explanation of the
                                    restrictions on entry of oranges from Spain and other countries,
                                    together with the provision for winter entry of Valencia oranges
                                    for the Canadian market, be transmitted to the Spanish
                                    Ambassador in Washington.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I would particularly call to your attention the fact that the embargo is
                            general in its scope and applies to all countries in which the
                            Mediterranean fruit fly is found, including all Mediterranean countries
                            and South Africa, as well as the American territory of Hawaii. It
                            therefore appears that the action of the Federal Horticultural Board in
                            this instance cannot be considered as being directed specifically
                            against Spanish oranges, which actually held a more privileged position
                            under the embargo regulations than did the other countries affected
                            thereby, a privilege which was withdrawn only after it had been
                            discovered that the Spanish oranges imported into this country were, in
                            fact, heavily infested with the Mediterranean fruit fly.</p>

                            taken under date of March 10th and 14th, by the Secretary of the United
                            States Treasury, when Collectors of Customs were instructed to prohibit
                            the importation and refuse delivery of all merchandise manufactured and
                            exported by or for the account of Fiskeby Fabriks A/B and Holmens Bruks

                            firms had failed to submit for inspection, for the purpose of obtaining
                            information therefrom as required by Section 510 of the Tariff Act of
                                1922,<note n="2" xml:id="d588fn2">42 Stat. 858, 968.</note> certain

                        <p>The Swedish Government, who are reluctant to believe that the United
                            States Government would require Swedish firms to disclose their books,
                            and consequently their trade secrets, as a possible condition for the
                            importation of Swedish goods into this country, are of the opinion
                            that—especially in the two cases referred to—such a requirement would
                            appear difficult to justify. In both cases it was stated to the Swedish
                            firms by the Treasury Department’s representative, Mr. Turrill, that the
                            purpose of said investigations was to ascertain the proper value on
                            which the American duty on the imported merchandise should be assessed
                            and to obtain an explanation as to why the goods shipped by the two
                            Swedish firms had been sold at a price lower than the prevailing Swedish
                            market value.</p>
                        <p>It might be recalled that the Swedish Paper Association has always been
                            most willing to assist the representatives of the Treasury Department in
                            their efforts to secure information desired with regard to Swedish
                            shipments of paper to the United States. When, therefore, Mr. Turrill
                            applied to the Paper Association last January and asked to have
                            explained to him why a shipment of 200 tons <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726"
                                facs="0808"/>newsprint, sold by Holmens Bruks och Fabriks A/B in May
                            1924 to an American firm, was quoted at a lower price than that quoted
                            to the Swedish newspapers for the same kind of paper during the year
                            1924, such explanation was given. It was pointed out to Mr. Turrill that
                            contracts for delivery of newsprint during a certain year to the Swedish
                            newspapers were generally closed several months ahead and at a fixed
                            price, independent of the future fluctuations of the market. Thus,
                            contracts for delivery of newsprint to the Swedish newspapers during the
                            year 1924 were generally closed some time during the autumn 1923, at the
                            market price then prevailing, and said market price had been
                            considerably higher than the price quoted in May 1924, due to later
                            fluctuations. In order to verify its statements, the Paper Association
                            had shown Mr. Turrill authentic figures concerning the fluctuations in
                            the prices of paper on the American market during 1924.</p>
                        <p>Holmens Bruks och Fabriks A/B had also explained to Mr. Turrill all the
                            different items which justified the difference between domestic price
                            agreed upon during the fall of 1923 and an export price for immediate
                            delivery in May 1924 and had even shown him the contract made with the
                            Swedish newspapers in the fall of 1923 as well as the invoice covering
                            the shipment in May 1924 to the United States, which information, in the
                            firm’s opinion, offered ample proof and must be regarded as fully
                            satisfying the purpose of the said investigation. Not till Mr. Turrill
                            expressed a desire to take copies of the documents in question did the
                            firm refuse to go further in their efforts to meet his wishes, as, in
                            their opinion, such a request seemed wholly unwarranted in view of the
                            information already given, and inconsistent, not only with the Swedish
                            law protecting trade secrets, but also with the ordinary canons of
                            international usage.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances I have the honor, acting upon instructions from my
                            Government, to make a formal protest against the above mentioned orders
                            issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and to ask that you will be so
                            good as to approach the competent United States authorities in this
                            matter. I trust that they will be disposed to reconsider their decision
                            and to remove, without delay, the barrier which has been placed against
                            the importation into this country of products of Fiskeby Fabriks A/B and
                            Holmens Bruks Fabriks A/B.</p>

                        <p>112. Federal Councilor Schulthess informs me that he is in receipt of
                            numerous complaints as to [activities] of Treasury representatives in
                            Switzerland to the effect that in the course of their investigations
                            they demand information as to production costs, loan contracts and trade
                            and manufacturing secrets; that they further demand opportunity to
                            verify these facts by examination of company’s books under threat of
                            preventing importation to the United States; that in some cases, notably
                            Sandoz and Company of Basel, chemical manufacturers, such import rights
                            have been refused. Mr. Schulthess stated that Federal Council considered
                            the matter as a flagrant violation of Swiss sovereignty which could not
                            be tolerated and requested that suitable inquiry be made. I have not
                            brought these complaints to the attention of the Treasury officials but
                            have endeavored to secure copies of their instructions without success
                            although they were promised prior to this date. I have told Mr.
                            Schulthess that there is undoubtedly a misunderstanding either on the
                            part of Swiss manufacturers or of our Treasury representatives but that
                            I am referring his complaint to the Department in order that an
                            investigation may be made as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>120. Legation’s 112, October 20 [<hi rend="italic">29</hi>], 2 p.m. In a
                            letter received today Mr. Schulthess states that since his conversation

                            stoppage of their imports into America if they do not immediately
                            consent to examination of their books. Schulthess states this firm has
                            been reserving its reply only pending outcome of his complaint reported
                            in telegram 112. He requests that I ask Treasury representative, Zürich,
                            to cause any American customs measures arising from such refusals to be
                            held in abeyance pending final reply to his objections.</p>

                        <p>99. Your 120, November 28, 5 p.m. Whole question of activities of customs
                            representatives abroad is receiving most careful consideration of this
                            Department and of the Treasury. It is hoped that general instructions
                            outlining a procedure governing customs representatives’ activities in
                            foreign countries can be issued shortly. Details have not yet been fully
                            agreed upon but procedure will be designed to meet objections raised by
                            Swiss Government. Swiss Minister in recent visit to the Department on
                            this subject was informed as above. You may communicate substance of
                            above to Swiss Government stating that a fuller communication will be
                            transmitted at the earliest possible moment.</p>

                        <p>15. Legation’s 120, November 28, 5 p.m. and Department’s 99, December 10,
                            4 p.m. Letter received today from George R. Coxe, assistant customs
                            representative at Zürich, is signed as “assistant customs attaché” on
                            stationery bearing similar letterhead. In reply to my inquiry by
                            telephone Coxe informs me that a law was recently enacted by Congress
                            creating customs representatives throughout Europe as attachés to our
                            diplomatic missions. I informed Coxe that we had not been so notified by
                            the Department and requested him to refrain from using this title
                            pending accomplishment of customary formalities <pb n="733"
                                xml:id="pg_733" facs="0815"/>under instructions from the Department.
                            In drafting these instructions suggest that consideration be given to
                            assurances already conveyed to Schulthess in accordance with
                            Department’s 99.</p>
                        <p>There is an obviously growing feeling of aggravation in Switzerland
                            against the activities and methods of our customs representatives. This
                            feeling finds frequent expression. Recently a leading member of the
                            Federal Assembly introduced a bill providing that representatives of
                            foreign treasury departments should not be allowed to perform official
                            duties in Switzerland without previous authorization from the Federal
                            Council. He stated that he was led to introduce this bill by the
                            necessity for curbing the improper activities of American Treasury
                            officials. See my despatch number 203, October 29th and 224, November
                            20, 1924.<note n="2" xml:id="d598fn2">Neither printed.</note></p>

                                xml:id="d599fn3">43 Stat. 748.</note> provides for customs attachés,
                            and that they shall be “regularly and officially attached to diplomatic
                            missions.” Definition of and procedure under this provision are being
                            discussed with Treasury. Hence no general instructions have been
                            prepared on this subject. Department has in mind points raised in your
                            despatches, and in cooperating with Treasury is endeavoring to arrive at
                            some workable solution of whole problem that will carry out provisions
                            of existing American laws and give no ground for objection by foreign
                            governments. Department approves your action in requesting Coxe withhold
                            use of new title temporarily and is advising Treasury in this sense.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Senator Borah</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your letter of February 5, 1925, transmitting a copy of
                            Senate Resolution No. 319 introduced by Senator King relative to a
                            deposit of so-called Turkish gold.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the preamble to this Resolution that the sum of gold
                            mentioned is believed to have been seized by the Turkish Government from
                            Armenians and to have been deposited by that Government <pb n="736"
                                xml:id="pg_736" facs="0818"/>in the Reichsbank of Berlin. By the
                            terms of the Resolution, the President would be requested to represent
                            to the Allied Powers that the United States has an interest in the sum
                            in question and a right to be consulted regarding its disposition; that
                            this sum should be set aside in trust for the persons from whom it is
                            said to have been taken or for the lawful representatives of such
                            persons and that if the sum is to be subjected to the payment of claims,
                            it should be applied in part toward the satisfaction of a claim of the
                            Government of the United States, in the amount of $13,000,000, for the
                            value of wheat and flour advanced to the Armenian Republic by the United
                            States Grain Corporation in 1919 and 1920.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with your suggestion, I submit the following observations
                            as of possible assistance to your Committee in its consideration of the
                            resolution introduced by Senator King:</p>
                        <p>1. According to the Department’s information, the sum of gold in question
                            was the subject of two agreements concluded between the German
                            Government and the Turkish Government in 1915. Under the first
                            agreement, which was dated April 20, 1915, the German Government granted
                            the Turkish Government an advance in gold amounting to 80,000,000 marks,
                            and under the second agreement, which was dated July 3, 1915, the
                            Turkish Government undertook to deliver the sum to the Council of the
                            Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt, in full ownership, as
                            security for the first issue of Turkish currency notes to the same
                            amount. In the execution of these agreements, the sum in question or a
                            part of it appears to have been actually advanced to the Turkish
                            Government by the German Government and to have been delivered to the
                            Council of the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt, by which in
                            turn it was deposited at the Reichsbank at Berlin and subsequently
                            transferred to the Bleichröder Bank in the same city. Prior to the
                            signature of the Treaty of Versailles, a part of the sum deposited by
                            the Council of the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt had been
                            withdrawn by the Council, and on the date of the signature of the Treaty
                            the balance in the Bleichröder Bank was 57,919,687.44 gold marks, the
                            equivalent of somewhat more than 3,000,000 Turkish pounds, gold. This
                            balance was transferred to the Bank of France on February 11, 1921, for
                            the account of the Reparation Commission, and the rights of Turkey with
                            respect to it were renounced in paragraph 3 of Article 58 of the Treaty
                            of Peace signed at Lausanne on July 24, 1923, between Turkey and the
                            Allied Powers. The paragraph mentioned and the succeeding paragraph,
                            which is also of interest in this connection, read as follows: <quote

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>2. The question of the possible interest of the United States in the sums
                            mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 58 of the Treaty signed at Lausanne
                            on July 24, 1923 by the Allied Powers and Turkey was carefully
                            considered by the Department at that time and the conclusion was reached
                            that the Government of the United States had no proprietary interest in
                            or claim to the sums in question which it could properly assert. As you
                            are aware, the United States was not a party to the Peace Settlement
                            with Turkey under which all right to the sum in question passed from
                            Turkey. The Department has not, therefore, raised objection to the
                            disposition of this gold by the parties having legal title thereto.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d601fn4">The Chargé in France reported in despatch No.
                                4827, Feb. 5, 1925 (not printed), that, in accordance with
                                instructions from the Department, he had stated at the 272d meeting
                                of the Conference of Ambassadors that the United States raised no
                                objection to the release of the gold in question to the Assessment
                                Commission established to assess reparation claims against
                                Turkey.</note></p>
                        <p>3. The Department has no information confirmatory of the statement in the
                            preamble to Senator King’s resolution to the effect that the sum in gold
                            there described was seized by the Turkish Government from Armenians.
                            This gold, as already indicated, was advanced to Turkey by Germany and
                            subsequently deposited in Germany by the Council of the Administration
                            of the Ottoman Public Debt. It is not felt therefore that this
                            Government would have any ground for suggesting that this sum should be
                            set aside in trust for the Armenians.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to the claim of the United States against Armenia for
                            wheat and flour furnished in 1919, a claim which now amounts to about
                            $15,000,000, it may be stated that the credit in question was extended
                            to the authorities of the Armenian Republic which was set up in 1919 in
                            territory which lay entirely without the territory of the former Ottoman
                            Empire and within the boundaries of Russia. It does not appear to the
                            Department that this Government could properly have asserted a claim
                            against the so-called Turkish gold on account of the advances made by it
                            to the Armenian authorities in 1919.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs</hi>: I beg to refer to this Department’s
                            letter of September 18, 1925, in reply to your inquiry regarding the
                            proposed purchase and sale by you and your associates of $3,000,000, Six
                            Months, 6%, Treasury Gold Notes of the Government of the Kingdom of the
                            Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and to subsequent conversations on this
                            subject with your representative, Mr. Chandler P. Anderson.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the information with which Mr. Anderson has furnished the
                            Department that you and your firm are committed to the Yugoslav
                            Government in respect of the financing in question and that, apart from
                            any other considerations, it is not improbable that if you should
                            withdraw at this time from the transaction, the notes now outstanding
                            would go to default and serious loss would be occasioned to American
                            holders of Yugoslav securities. The Department regrets that the
                            contemplated financing was not brought to its attention sufficiently in
                            advance of your commitment thereto as to permit your decision in the
                            matter to be guided by the Department’s views with respect to the
                            extension of credit to the Yugoslav Government.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the Department’s letter of September 18, 1925, this
                            Government does not view Yugoslav financing with favor at the present
                            time. The reasons for its attitude were fully explained to Mr. Anderson
                            and are, as you know, due to the failure of that Government <pb n="741"
                                xml:id="pg_741" facs="0823"/>to take steps looking to the refunding
                            of its indebtedness to the United States. In view of your commitment,
                            however, and actuated by a desire to avoid possible embarrassment and
                            loss to American investors, the Department, while maintaining its
                            position as set forth in the above-mentioned letter of September 18,
                            1925, and without in any sense establishing a precedent, is willing to
                            state that it will interpose no objection to the purchase and sale by
                            you of the $3,000,000, Six Months Notes in question for the purpose of
                            refunding an equal amount of Six Months Notes maturing September 30,
                            1925. The Department desires it to be understood, however, that
                            objection will be offered to any further renewal of the present credit
                            or to the extension of additional credit until a satisfactory
                            understanding is reached between the Yugoslav Government and the World
                            War Foreign Debt Commission regarding the refunding of the former’s
                            indebtedness to the United States. Accordingly it would object to the
                            purchase and sale by you of the $2,000,000 additional notes, referred to
                            in your letter of September 17, 1925.</p>

                            last, and renewed on April 1st last for another six months, would mature
                            on October 1st next. The Yugoslav Government, although professing to
                            have funds on hand sufficient to enable them to pay off these notes at
                            maturity, are anxious to renew them and Blair and Company are also
                            desirous of so doing in order thus to preserve for some time longer

                                    Finance. ‘After bringing pressure to bear on our Government we
                                    are informed verbally that our Government reluctantly agreed not
                                    to raise objections to issue Six Months Notes to provide for
                                    funds for those maturing Sept. 30th. It was intimated that we
                                    could not count on any financing being approved either for
                                    renewal of the new notes or for other purposes until commission
                                    had come to Washington to settle outstanding questions debt owed
                                    by your Government to our Minister of Finance.’ Blair”.</p>

                        <p>Mr. O’Shaughnessy informs me that in view of the second telegram quoted
                            above the renewal of the Yugoslav Treasury Notes for another six months
                            is now practically assured but that further financing on the part of
                            Blair and Company is at a standstill in view of the last sentence in
                            this telegram and in view of the continued absence from Belgrade of the
                            Minister of Finance, Dr. Stojadinovitch. As stated in my Despatch No.
                            2810 of the 12th instant,<note n="4" xml:id="d608fn4">Not

                            the assurances given by the Yugoslav Government in connection with its
                            debt to the United States, I am proposing to call upon Dr.
                            Stojadinovitch upon his return in order to ascertain his intentions
                            regarding the funding of this debt.</p>
                        <p>I may also mention that I learn strictly confidentially that the
                            relations between Blair and Company and Armstrong, Whitworth and
                            Company, have of late become still further strained and that unless they
                            change for the better, it is unlikely that the British firm will be
                            allowed to participate in further financing by Blair and Company. My
                            Despatch No. 2670 of May 6th last<note n="4" xml:id="d608fn6">Not

                            account of the attitude in a number of matters of Armstrong, Whitworth
                            and Company.</p>
                        <p>I may add in this connection that a few days ago Messrs. T. L. Addy
                            Taylor and E. P. Thomas of the United States Steel Products <pb n="743"

                            stated that they had been in correspondence with a lawyer here about the
                            possibility of their Company bidding for the construction of the great
                            bridge across the Danube at a point a few kilometres below Belgrade.
                            They stated that their Company did not propose to finance this
                            undertaking directly but possibly through Blair and Company. They
                            proposed to call on Mr. O’Shaughnessy. As reported in my Despatch No.
                            2670, above referred to, and in other despatches, the construction of
                            this bridge, the so-called Pancevo Bridge, has lately been considered by
                            Blair and Company and Armstrong, Whitworth and Company as forming part
                            of the proposed Adriatic Railway.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We beg to acknowledge your letter to us
                            dated September 23, 1925 in which you refer to the State Department’s
                            letter of September 18, 1925 in reply to our letter of September 12,
                            1925 with reference to the proposed purchase and sale by us and
                            associates of $3,000,000. Six months 6% Treasury Gold Notes of the
                            Government of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, for the purpose of
                            refunding an equal amount of Six Months Treasury Gold Notes held by
                            American investors maturing September 30, 1925, and are pleased to note
                            the Department interposes no objection to such purchase and sale by
                            us.</p>
                        <p>This contemplated financing was brought to the attention of the
                            Department at the earliest practicable time. As you are already advised,
                            this financing was not the loan of new money to the Jugo Slav
                            Government, but was for the purpose of taking care of securities
                            maturing on September 30th which had been previously issued in this
                            country with the knowledge of and without objection from the Department.
                            Our representative arrived at Belgrade to discuss the matter of this
                            maturity on September 10, 1925. Having determined the intention of the
                            Jugo Slav Government not to repay the notes but to sell an issue of
                            refunding notes running for a period of six months more, we addressed to
                            the Department our letter of September 12th, to which the Department’s
                            letter of the 18th was a reply.</p>
                        <p>Having no reason to believe that the State Department would interpose
                            objection to this renewal of a transaction which it had already passed
                            on two prior occasions, and no reply having been received from the State
                            Department until the arrival on September 21st of your letter of
                            September 18th, and the time for action being very <pb n="744"
                                xml:id="pg_744" facs="0826"/>limited because the notes were about to
                            mature on September 30th, our representative in Belgrade was permitted
                            to go ahead with the arrangements for refunding the issue. We could not
                            have withdrawn from those arrangements at that late date without serious
                            embarrassment to the Jugo Slav Government and serious impairment of our
                            good relations with it.</p>
                        <p>The original advance of money which these notes represent was made in the
                            summer of 1924, and we refer to the official letter of the Department,
                            dated July 24, 1924,<note n="5" xml:id="d609fn5">Not printed.</note>
                            advising us that the Department offered no objection to the
                            financing.</p>
                        <p>In connection with that financing an advance of certain additional sums
                            was under consideration by the issue of the bonds of the 1922 Gold Loan,
                            which, by the contract of purchase of the notes, were then and still are
                            under option to us, and in connection therewith, in December 1924, Mr.
                            W. B. Poland, on our behalf, made a special trip to Washington, at which
                            time he called on Mr. Leland Harrison, Assistant Secretary of State, and
                            also upon other representatives of the Department, as well as upon the
                            Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce, for the purpose
                            of determining, as fully as possible, the attitude of our Government to
                            the negotiations which would be necessary in connection therewith, and
                            we respectfully refer to our letter to the Department of December 15,
                                1924,<note n="5" xml:id="d609fn6">Not printed.</note> in which we
                            stated that we did not wish to proceed seriously with these negotiations
                            until we were sure there was no objection by the Department of State,
                            and to the reply of the Department under date of December 18, 1924<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d609fn7">Not printed.</note> confirming the fact that
                            there was no objection to the issue of these securities in the American
                            market.</p>
                        <p>The project of issuing bonds has not proved feasible up to the present
                            time and when the original issue of notes came due in March, 1925, it
                            was necessary to extend them by an issue of new six months notes, namely
                            the notes now maturing. Under date of March 18th we advised the
                            Department that we had about concluded arrangements to purchase these
                            notes, and under date of March 20th were promptly advised by the
                            Department that it offered no objection to the floatation of this issue
                            on the American market.</p>
                        <p>We recite the above facts in order to show you that not only had we no
                            reason to expect an adverse reply to our letter of September 12th or to
                            believe the matter was not being brought to the attention of the
                            Department sufficiently in advance of our commitment to permit our
                            decision in the matter to be guided by the Department’s views with
                            respect to the extension of credit to the Jugo Slav Government, as
                            suggested in your letter of September 23rd; but, on the contrary, <pb
                                n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0827"/>we, and the American investors
                            who were our clients in the purchase of the notes had every reason to
                            believe and expect, when making their investment, as well as now, that
                            the State Department would interpose no objection to an issue of new
                            short term notes in lieu of the notes the issue of which the Department
                            had already approved, and the extension of which was involved in the
                            negotiations of which the Department had been advised by our letter of
                            December 15, 1924, especially since we had received no intimation
                            whatever of any change of attitude on the part of the Department.</p>
                        <p>We have at all times endeavored to cooperate fully with the State
                            Department when considering finance for the Jugo Slav Government. When
                            we received the first intimation of the attitude of the Department with
                            respect to such matters at the time when the Jugo Slav Loan of 1922 was
                            under consideration, we placed ourselves wholly at the disposal of the
                            Department, and we have before us a letter signed by Mr. Hughes, then
                            Secretary of State, acknowledging the aid of our representative, Mr.
                            Sheldon, at Belgrade, as well as an official telegram of the Department
                            advising us that an understanding had been reached between the American
                            Chargé d’Affaires at Belgrade and the Jugo Slav Government. We have also
                            understood that subsequently representatives of the Jugo Slav Government
                            came to this country in connection with its debt to the United States,
                            with what result we have never been officially advised. And we beg to
                            call your attention to the fact that the original advance of money
                            represented by these notes and the official letter of the Department
                            with respect thereto, dated July 24, 1924 above referred to, was
                            subsequent to the visit of these representatives.</p>
                        <p>We desire to continue our cooperation, and in expressing this intention,
                            we feel that we should be permitted to add that as American bankers
                            endeavoring to aid, as circumstances will permit, in the rehabilitation
                            of one of our allies in the World War, owing debts to our Government, we
                            had reason to hope for the cooperation of the State Department with us
                            as well. We beg to point out that it makes our position very difficult,
                            both as to prestige abroad and our duty to our clients here, to find,
                            after our careful efforts as recited above to ascertain the general
                            attitude of the Department, that it had changed its position within so
                            very short a time of an imminent maturity, and without previous warning
                            to us which would permit us to accommodate ourselves to its position
                            without causing serious misunderstandings abroad and embarrassments to
                            us, our associates and clients here. We also feel that unless the
                            maturity of the present issue of six months notes can be satisfactorily
                            otherwise provided for, we, and the investors who have purchased from
                            us, are entitled, in view of the past action of the Department, to
                            expect <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0828"/>that it will interpose
                            no objection to any necessary refunding of these notes at maturity.
                            Credits which have once been passed without objection and which need to
                            be refunded at maturity are very different from fresh credits for new
                            money. In view of the exchange problems which must continue until all
                            currencies are stabilized, an objection to a credit of this character
                            would constitute such drastic action that we cannot believe that the
                            Department, after full consideration of all the equities involved, will
                            continue the position with respect to such credits as is intimated in
                            your letter.</p>
                        <p>Since the receipt of your communications we have made representations to
                            the Jugo Slav Government and are just in receipt of unofficial cable
                            advices from which we understand that the Government has decided to send
                            a mission to the United States to discuss its debt.</p>
                        <p>We have also written the Jugo Slav Government an official letter, in
                            which we advise it that in our opinion it will greatly enhance the
                            credit of their Government in this market and will contribute to the
                            possibility of further offerings of securities if it will make an early
                            effort to reach an understanding with the World War Foreign Debt
                            Commission regarding the refunding of the Jugo Slav Government’s
                            indebtedness to the United States.</p>
                        <p>We reiterate our desire to cooperate with the Department in this matter
                            and are ready to place ourselves at your disposal in any other practical
                            manner which you may suggest.</p>
