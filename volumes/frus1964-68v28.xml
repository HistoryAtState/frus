                <head>Preface</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> Authorization
                    Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on
                    October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the
                    Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                    Foreign Relations series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume, which was compiled in 1993,
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 5 years (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34
                    volumes a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration. This
                    volume presents the documentary record of U.S. policy toward Laos, in many
                    respects a second front of the Vietnam war. Laos was also a secret war fought in
                    obscurity until the 1970s. While the war in Laos is no longer secret, it is
                    still very much overshadowed by Vietnam. The fighting in Laos and Vietnam were
                    clearly closely connected, but the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series has chosen to cover them in separate volumes. This editorial decision is
                    justified because the Johnson administration drew a distinction between its
                    extensive operations in Vietnam and its efforts to support the Royal Lao
                    Government against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese. Reinforcing this
                    separation was the presence of U.S. Ambassadors in Laos determined to maintain
                    control and supervision over the U.S. military effort in Laos in the face of
                    efforts by military commanders in Vietnam to strike the enemy wherever he was
                    regardless of national boundaries. Thus the U.S. campaign to interdict supplies
                    moving down the portions of the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                        Minh</persName> Trail in Laos became the point of most friction between the
                    diplomats and the soldiers. As much as Vietnam and Laos were separate
                    operations, they were of course closely interconnected, and this volume should
                    be read in conjunction with Volumes I–VII, Vietnam, 1964–1968. In addition,
                    Volume XXVII, Mainland Southeast Asia; Regional Affairs, presents related
                    documentation for Thailand, Cambodia, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
                    that helps to explain events and policy in Laos.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also tend to apply these selection criteria in
                    accordance with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspond-ence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies, including relevant
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates as
                    may be declassified;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published
                    record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all
                    records needed to provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign
                    policy decisions and significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires
                    that government agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government
                    engaged in foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the
                    Department of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records
                    pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of
                    selected records. Many but not all of the sources consulted in the preparation
                    of this volume have been declassified and are available for review at the
                    National Archives and Records Administration. The declassification review and
                    opening for public review of all Department of State records no later than 30

                    Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XXVIII</p>
                <p>The editor of volume XXVIII developed eight areas of specific focus for the
                    selection. (1) Formulation of policy in Washington on providing U.S. support for
                    the air and ground war in Laos either by U.S. support of Lao Armed Forces or by
                    U.S. direct actions. (2) U.S. policy decisions in Washington in conjunction with
                    U.S. officials in Laos to support the neutralist <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> government against both its right-wing and
                    Pathet Lao opponents. (3) Unsuccessful efforts to reach a new negotiated
                    settlement on Laos to replace the failed Geneva settlement of 1962, especially
                    through the influence and good services of the Soviet Union. (4) The campaign to
                    interdict logistical supplies traveling down the Laos portion of the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail destined to support Viet Cong
                    and North Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam and the bureaucratic battle for
                    control of the ground intelligence on and harassment of these interdiction
                    operations that was fought between the Ambassador in Laos and the Military
                    Assistance Commander, Vietnam. (5) The Central Intelligence Agency 's support
                    and direction of Meo (H'mong) and other tribal anti-North Vietnamese guerrillas.
                    (6) The intelligence assessment controversy over the amount of North Vietnamese
                    infiltration down the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail
                    and the effectiveness of U.S. interdiction efforts. (7) The campaign by
                    Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">Robert McNamara</persName> to
                    apply technology to the campaign against infiltration and to apply appropriate
                    technology in the controversy over whether jet aircraft or propeller driven
                    aircraft were more suited to the warfare in Laos. (8) The establishment and then
                    the loss to North Vietnamese forces of U.S.-manned site 85 at Phou <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>Pha Thi, the major navigation aide in northern
                    Laos for the bombing campaign against North Vietnam.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                    which are described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed
                    according to accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents in
                    the limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors
                    for each document included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and
                    punctuation are retained as found in the source text, except that obvious
                    typographical errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the
                    source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic
                    type; an addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text
                    are printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in
                    the source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>sources, provide references to
                    important related documents printed in other volumes, describe key events, and
                    provide summaries of and citations to public statements that supplement and
                    elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from memoirs and other
                    first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to supplement or explicate
                    the official record.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises,
                    and makes recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors the overall
                    compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all aspects of
                    the preparation and declassification of the series. Although the Advisory
                    Committee does not attempt to review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, it does monitor the overall process and makes recommendations on
                    particular problems that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee has not reviewed this volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which was completed in 1997,
                    resulted in the decision to withhold 1.4 percent of the documentation selected.
                    Two documents were denied in full. The remaining documentation provides an
                    accurate account of U.S. policy toward Laos during this period.</p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
                    accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12356 on National
                    Security Information and applicable laws, which was superseded by Executive
                    Order 12958 on April 20, 1995.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12356, information that concerns one or more of the
                    following categories, and the disclosure of which reasonably could be expected
                    to cause damage to the national security, requires classification:</p>
                <p>1) military plans, weapons, or operations;</p>
                <p>2) the vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, proj-ects, or
                    plans relating to the national security;</p>
                <p>3) foreign government information;</p>
                <p>4) intelligence activities (including special activities), or intelligence
                    sources or methods;</p>
                <p>5) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>6) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national
                    security;</p>
                <p>7) U.S. Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;</p>
                <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>
                <p>8) cryptology; or</p>
                <p>9) a confidential source.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>

                <head>Sources</head>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department's Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between
                    the President and Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of
                    overseas diplomatic posts. When this volume was being compiled, all Department
                    of State records consulted were still under the custody of the Department, and
                    the footnotes citing Department of State files suggest that the Department is
                    the repository. By the time of publication, however, all the Department's
                    indexed central (or decimal) files for the 1964–1968 period have been
                    permanently transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration
                    (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the Department's decentralized
                    office (or lot) files covering this period will also be transferred from the
                    Department's custody to Archives II over the next several years.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of Presidents <persName>Johnson</persName> and other White
                    House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at
                    the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign
                    affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other Federal
                    agencies including the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence
                    Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                <p>The Department of State arranged for access to the many audiotapes of President
                    Johnson's telephone conversations that are held at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library. The first audiotapes became available
                    to the editors in late 1994 (a year after this volume was completed) with most
                    audiotapes following during 1995 and 1996 (after this volume was well into
                    declassification). The editors did not believe that the small portion of taped
                    material relating exclusively to Laos justified any delay in publication of the
                    volume. In 1964, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    discussed Laos on the telephone within the context of Southeast Asia and two of
                    those taped discussions are printed in Volume XXVII, Mainland Southeast Asia;
                    Regional Affairs.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides access to Department of State historians
                    to high-level intelligence documents from those records in the custody of that
                    Agency and at the Presidential Libraries. This access is arranged and
                    facilitated by the History Staff of the Center for the Study of Intelligence,
                    Central Intelligence Agency, pursuant to a May <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>1992 memorandum of understanding. Department of State and
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> historians continue to work out the
                    procedural and scholarly aspects of identifying the key portions of the
                    intelligence record.</p>
                <p>In preparing this specific volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential
                    papers and other White House files at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library.</p>
                <p>The second important area of research was the extensive records of the Department
                    of State, both the central files and to a lesser extent the lot files. In Laos
                    the Ambassador had a unique responsibility for coordination of the U.S. and
                    allied military effort against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese in addition
                    to his political and diplomatic responsibilities, thereby allowing him to act as
                    a de facto military commander. This responsibility brought the Ambassador into
                    conflict with the military commanders in Vietnam, General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and later General Abrams. The
                    papers of <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and Abrams were
                    important sources for documenting the military side of this bureaucratic
                    struggle. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName> was the
                    architect of the Laos agreement of 1962, and although his influence on policy
                    towards Laos under President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was
                    not as great as it had been under <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, his papers at the Library of Congress, especially his
                    telephone conversations, are still an important adjunct depository for
                    information on Laos.</p>
                <p>Because U.S. policy in Laos had such a strong military component, the editor did
                    extensive research in the records of the Department of Defense (<gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>) at the Washington National Records Center at
                    Suitland, Maryland, particularly the records of the Secretary of Defense and his
                    major assistants. The files of the Department of Defense of most value were
                    those of <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s office and the
                    office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.
                    In addition, the official files of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary
                    of Defense's cable files at the <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> Historian at
                    the Department of Defense, the <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> Files at the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library,
                    and the papers <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName> at the
                    National Defense University provided key supplemental documentation.</p>
                <p>Laos also had an extremely large intelligence component that included secret air
                    support of the Laos armed forces, covert support of the H'mong and other tribal
                    groups, intelligence gathering and covert sabotage and harassment raids against
                    the <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail, and an
                    intelligence assessment controversy about the nature of the North Vietnamese
                    infiltration and U.S. success in preventing it. The files of the Directors of
                    Central Intelligence, most importantly Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>'s, provided invaluable insight into how intelligence
                    and foreign policy interacted in Laos. The files of the Bureau of Intelligence
                    and Research in the Department of State provided both finished intelligence and
                    a window into the oversight of covert policy through the records of the 303
                    Committee. The editor attempted to document the history of the covert
                    paramilitary <pb n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0017"/>operations in Laos by
                    providing overview documentation based on files of the Directorate of Operations
                    of the Central Intelligence Agency and other relevant collections. Although two
                    key documents selected for publication on this issue remain classified, the
                    basic outline of the story, if not all the details, is presented here.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of these records is in process. Many of the records are already
                    available for public review at the National Archives. The declassification
                    review of other records is going forward in accordance with the provisions of
                    Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old except for any
                    file series exemptions proposed by agencies and approved by the President,
                    should be reviewed for declassification by 2000.</p>

                        <p>At a meeting of the Special Group (5412) on November 14, 1963,<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">A memorandum of that meeting is ibid.</note> General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> proposed that an ad
                            hoc subcommittee be formed to review United States programs involving
                            support of foreign paramilitary forces. Fourteen countries were listed
                            as having internal security problems and having received U.S. support
                            for paramilitary organizations. Of these fourteen countries, however,
                            only two (Laos [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source not
                                declassified</hi>]) are now receiving covert U.S. support for their
                            paramilitary forces. The remaining twelve countries receive overt U.S.
                            support for their paramilitary forces. Accordingly, the ad hoc
                            subcommittee has limited itself to a review of the covert paramilitary
                            support programs in Laos [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                not declassified</hi>]. Reports on these programs are attached at

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>Paramilitary forces being aided by the U.S. covertly in Laos [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source not declassified</hi>] are
                            remote from the urban centers, diffused throughout rural areas, and
                            small in number in relation to the regular <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0034"/>military forces. Consequently, they are unlikely to
                            develop into power centers rivalling the established governments or to
                            be involved directly as a major influence in a struggle for power in the
                            foreseeable future. Aid given to Lao [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source not declassified</hi>] paramilitary forces has not
                            lessened the confidence of these governments in the United States or
                            been inimical to United States interests.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. is engaged in overt and covert support to paramilitary forces in
                            Laos but in large part the elements being aided are remote from the
                            centers of power and unlikely to be involved in any future power
                            struggle. Military assistance is being provided overtly to the regular
                            non-communist forces, at the request and with the approval of Prime
                            Minister Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>.
                            These regular forces include the conservative Forces Armees du Royaume
                                (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>) under General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and the neutralist forces loyal
                            to Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> under
                            General Kong Le. This overt assistance is in accordance with Article 6
                            of the Protocol of the Geneva Agreements, although we attempt to avoid
                            publicizing it.</p>
                        <p>Covert support is given to paramilitary guerrilla and intelligence
                            collecting groups which consist primarily of tribal members. General

                            familiar with our assistance to these groups but not in detail. Although
                            Prince Souvanna is generally aware of our activities in this area, he is
                            less so than <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The genesis of this program stems from high level U.S. Government
                            approval in late 1960 and early 1961 in response to a recommendation by
                            the U.S. Ambassador in Laos that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            enlist tribal support to fight communism. The main effort in this
                            program has been development of the Meo, the largest non-Lao ethnic
                            group in Laos, as an effective guerrilla force and the provision of
                            plausibly deniable U.S. air support for the program.</p>
                        <p>Since the program's inception <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has
                            worked with the two key Meo leaders, Touby Lyfong and Vang Pao. Vang
                            Pao, the commander of the Meo forces, is a regular <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> officer and the Meo forces are
                            technically considered to be <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> ADC
                            units. As authorized by the Special Group in June 1963, this program has
                            expanded to a present force of approximately 19,000 armed Meo guerrillas
                            (23,000 authorized) engaged in village defense and guerrilla activities
                            against the Pathet Lao. [<hi rend="italic">7 lines of source text not

                            paramilitary and military requirements. This air support, conducted by
                            an ostensibly private and commercial company, has been able to continue
                            operations in Laos under <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> ADC units, which are not part of
                            the Meo ADC force, have a total strength of about 9,000 and are
                            essentially home guard or militia-type <pb n="4" xml:id="pg_4" facs="0036"/>military units concerned with local village or urban
                            defense. On occasion, however, they have been used as regular forces.
                            The ADC's are considered to be part of the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and come under its organizational command. Thus,

                            have also begun recently to develop some ADC elements which will
                            presumably be controlled and maintained by the regular neutralist forces

                        <p>The basic power rivalry in Laos is between the pro-Communist Pathet Lao
                                (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>) and the non-Communist Lao.
                            Although rivalries continue to exist between the neutralist and
                            conservative factions, the aggressive <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            posture toward the neutralists since a year ago has resulted in a more
                            cooperative neutralist-conservative relationship, especially between
                            Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, and also
                            between the military in the field. Rivalries also exist within each of
                            the two non-Communist factions. Growing restiveness has been reported
                            within conservative ranks. It is generally recognized, however, that any
                            attempt to create a new power alignment among the non-Communist
                            leadership requires U.S. support if it is to succeed. We have made our
                            position clear to all concerned that the U.S. continues to support Prime
                            Minister Souvanna and the Geneva settlement and we consider any changes
                            in the existing setup inimical to U.S. and Lao interests.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the danger always exists that some ambitious or misled
                            group might attempt to upset the present fragile balance. A coup attempt
                            could, for example, come from within the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> ranks by generals disillusioned with <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s leadership. It could also
                            result from a power play by Col. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> and the <gloss target="#t_DNC1">DNC</gloss>,
                            although this would probably require <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0037"/>support by other <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> elements. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> claims to have the
                            situation under control. We can expect, however, to continue to hear
                            rumors about such coup plotting. In addition, rivalries between
                            neutralist military leaders will continue to produce rumors about
                            efforts of one neutralist group to gain ascendancy over Kong Le's
                            position. These moves, however, among conservative or neutralist groups,
                            involve primarily regular military forces.</p>
                        <p>The danger of an attempt to gain power by the principal paramilitary
                            group, the Meo, is more remote. The Meo, as all tribal groups in Laos,
                            are isolated from the country's political arena and are not integrated
                            into Lao society. They are located away from the main centers of the
                            country, living in scattered villages at the higher elevations (the Yao
                            and Kha tribal groups are even more isolated and too few in number to
                            pose a threat). Moreover, the Meo are subject to U.S. guidance and
                            direction. The development of the Meo as a rival center of armed power
                            with political objectives in a national Lao context does not seem to be
                            a realistic possibility. The main problem posed by the Meo, and all
                            other tribal groups in Laos, is the need for their eventual integration
                            into Lao society and identification with the Lao nation. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> is beginning to recognize this,
                            as is Meo leader <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> who has
                            recently also established a working relationship with Kong Le in the
                            Plaine des Jarres area. Other Lao leaders, however, including Souvanna,
                            continue to view the Meo and other tribal peoples in the traditional Lao
                            manner of the tribal people being separate and apart from the Lao.
                            Souvanna even seems to feel that military support for the Meo could lead
                            to a greater autonomous status for them. He has expressed opposition to
                            the use of Thai in support of the Meo. In terms of U.S. interests,
                            however, the Meo will continue to play an essential and useful military
                            role as an anti-Communist guerrilla force. At the same time it is
                            important to continue efforts to impress on the Meo the need for
                            national identification with Laos and the Lao government. The first
                            steps in this respect give some reason for encouragement, although a
                            better relationship with and acceptance by Souvanna is still
                            essential.</p>

                            together to develop a combined plan for actions in Laos. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> concluded with the request that
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> initiate discussions of these
                            operations with <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon and advise
                            results. On 21 December, the decision was made at the Secretary of
                            Defense level that <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> would not
                            recommend operations across the Laos border pursuant to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> Oplan 34B–64 because the political
                            risks would exceed the probable results. However, the Secretary of
                            Defense noted that highly effective <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            operations from within Laos along the Lao frontier should be expanded
                            and the Kha operation developed, at least to cover this area, for
                            intelligence purposes as the first stage. This decision was transmitted
                            to Vientiane and Saigon by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            Washington on the same date. This was amplified in a subsequent <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> message from Washington on 17 January
                            to Saigon<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">Not further identified.</note> which
                            made two principal points: (1) that Vientiane had authority to expand

                        <p>The Pathet Lao—unquestionably supported by North Vietnamese forces—have
                            recently made new advances in central Laos. They have forced the
                            neutralist and conservative forces off the strategic Na Kay Plateau,
                            which is an important link in the routes southward towards Viet-Nam, and
                            moved to within 15 miles of the Mekong River port of Thakhek. They can
                            take Thakhek at will.</p>
                        <p>Although the Pathet Lao action began as a response to moves initiated by
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, they have gone well
                            beyond the level of activity that had been tacitly accepted as
                            permissible under the umbrella of the Geneva Accords. At the very least,
                            these actions are a probe designed to see how far the Geneva framework
                            can be warped in favor of further Communist encroachment. They have been
                            accompanied by a substantial increase in Viet Minh presence and
                            Communist capabilities in the Plaine des Jarres area as well. If we fail
                            to react, the Communists are likely to use this improved military
                            capability with increasing aggressiveness in ways which must damage our
                            position not only in Laos but in South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>We should not view an increased level of Communist activity in Laos as an
                            isolated phenomenon. The Communist side almost certainly views the
                            situation in all of Southeast Asia as one of change and opportunity.
                            From the Communist point of view the Free World position is in disarray:
                            Recurring coups in South Viet-Nam and American admissions that the
                            military situation there is not good; continued speculation in the
                            Western press about neutralist solutions for the area, which has
                            received impetus from General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De
                                Gaulle</persName>'s formulas for ending hostilities in the <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0040"/>area; and apparent US indecision on how
                            to respond to Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s
                            efforts to obtain guarantees of Cambodian neutrality by threatening to
                            turn to Communist China. All of those who today seek to reduce or
                            eliminate the US position in Southeast Asia—the Communist Chinese, the
                            French, the North Vietnamese, the Cambodians—appear to have one view in
                            common: the United States is either unable or unwilling to exert its
                            vast power effectively to defend its positions in Southeast Asia. And in
                            this, the Communists may see an opportunity for decisive action.</p>
                        <p>For all these reasons, we must, in my judgment, respond promptly and
                            firmly to Communist initiatives in central Laos. We should consider
                            encouraging further Thai reinforcements along the Mekong backed up by
                            visible preparations to introduce US Marine landing battalions and air
                            elements into Thailand.</p>
                        <p>I request that you authorize me to undertake an appropriate interagency
                            discussion for such a course of action on an urgent contingency

                        <p>It was agreed to revamp the objectives of the State Department draft<note n="2" xml:id="d4fn2">Reference is to a previous draft of attachment
                                1 to <ref target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> on what the movement
                            of U.S. forces to northeast Thailand was <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0041"/>expected to accomplish so that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> could decide what was required. This
                            new paper, attached also contains recommended action inside Laos for
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Solbert</persName> opened the
                            discussion by saying that he was confused by the State Department paper
                            and wanted to know from Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> what he really wanted to do in Laos. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> said that there were
                            several objectives: (a) cause the Communists to pause in their
                            aggressive actions; (b) worry them more about North Vietnam. There was
                            no intention of moving U.S. forces into Thailand to actually get them
                            involved in the Mekong valley. The move was a political one for the
                            purposes of being a deterrent and to increase American capability in
                            South- east Asia at a time when the U.S. was thinking about more
                            strenuous action in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. This type of response did not satisfy the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> representatives. General Clay was insistent that these
                            were only words and there was no credibility left in the idea of
                            deploying military forces to Thailand. Further, if such forces were
                            deployed they were of no use in Thakhek. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Marshall Green</persName> both tried in vain to explain to General
                            Clay the political advantages of such deployment as a move against the
                            Communists and in favor of the Thais. It was also suggested that U.S.
                            forces in Thailand might have a very positive effect on <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>. General Clay still thought
                            this would accomplish nothing in Laos. Mr. Myers mentioned that the
                            arrival of the U.S. forces in Thailand as a political gesture combined
                            with the actions to be taken inside Laos could have some effect. They
                            would strengthen Laotian forces in being so that the nibbling tactics of
                            the Communists might be stopped and so that a more positive political
                            program might get under way inside Laos to serve as a motivating force
                            for the Lao Army as well as for the population at large.</p>
                        <p>3. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> agreed with this
                            point but felt that the military complaint about the actual objective of
                            the U.S. military role had to be clarified so that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> could make a determination of what
                            steps could be taken. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> mumbled something about we would at least buy
                            some time. General Clay accepted this as an improvement in clarifying
                            the objective; that it was only to bide time and not to do anything
                            serious. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> went on to
                            explain that he was concerned about how we did these moves, because they
                            should add to our general capability in Southeast Asia and make it
                            possible to initiate measures in North Vietnam. He feared, however, that
                            if we began to carry out attacks in North Vietnam prior to some
                            victories in the Delta, that the North Vietnam program would come under
                            Congressional attack by Senator <persName corresp="#p_MM1">Mansfield</persName> and others and that there would be an up-surge
                            in Congressional support for the DeGaulle position for Vietnam. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> explained, apropos of
                            nothing, that he was much more in favor of doing more about North
                            Vietnam, contrary to what some people may think. (He was obviously
                            referring <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0042"/>to the Stewart Alsop
                            column in the Saturday Evening Post, which said <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> did not favor attacks on North
                            Vietnam, to prove that he was really a red-blooded fellow.)</p>
                        <p>4. There was some general thrashing around over the business of what
                            guise would be required to withdraw U.S. forces from Thailand once they
                            were there. Nothing of any importance was decided. It was now almost
                            11:00 a.m. and it was agreed that the next step was to revise the State
                            paper which should be done in the afternoon. The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> representatives, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>, Mr. Neubert and Mr. Myers went to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>'s office for a few minutes to get
                            into some more of the specifics of the changes in the draft. Before
                            anything was said, however, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> burst in the room, emphasizing again his
                            interest in North Vietnam operations, and said that since the situation
                            was changed, his view had also changed. “If the Communists lunge, we hit
                            them in North Vietnam.” With a cheery goodbye he left the room.</p>
                        <p>5. The conference in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GM1">Green</persName>'s
                            office went nowhere as the General and two Colonels made loud noises
                            about the value of the old July 1963 Phase I, II, and III plan for
                                Laos,<note n="3" xml:id="d4fn3">For the plan as described to the

                            the point and which gave the military more room. This discussion was
                            adjourned around 12:15 p.m. and Mr. Neubert and Mr. Myers carried on the
                            conversation for a few more minutes. It was agreed that the part of the
                            paper that had to be approved by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            should merely outline the military action and that the part inside Laos,

                            not get mixed up in what the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had to
                            approve. Mr. Neubert was in agreement with this point. It was agreed
                            that others would begin drafting the paper at 1:30 and Mr. Blaufarb
                            arrived to participate in the afternoon drafting session.</p>

                        <p>1. This memorandum presents for the DCI's approval a draft Memorandum for
                            the President<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">See attachment 1 to <ref target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> proposing a new series of
                            actions intended to stabilize the situation in Southeast Asia. It
                            follows up on reference <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 256
                            (attached) which authorized certain actions in Phase II of the Laos
                            Action Program.</p>
                        <p>2. The memorandum, which we understand is planned to be submitted to the
                            Standing Group or Executive Committee of the National Security Council
                            on 26 February 1964, first points out that recent events in Southeast
                            Asia have given the Communists what may appear to them to be an
                            opportunity for “broad, forward movement.” The paper sets forth a series
                            of actions intended to disabuse the Communists of this impression,
                            discourage them from attempting further advance in Laos, and give them
                            reason to believe the U.S. is prepared to escalate the conflict in order
                            to defend its positions in Southeast Asia and reverse the recent course
                            of developments.</p>
                        <p>3. The paper essentially recommends that the President authorize the
                            Secretaries of State and Defense to carry out parts of Phase II of the
                            program of graduated actions contained in the reference <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 256. It is made clear that a
                            delegation of authority only is requested for implementation when the
                            Secretaries of State and Defense agree such action to be appropriate and
                            that it is not intended to implement the actions at this time.</p>
                        <p>4. With regard to Laos the proposed actions are largely intensifications
                            of activities currently underway. Three of the proposed actions <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0044"/>would be the responsibility of
                            the Agency to implement if requested to do so by the Secretaries of
                            State and Defense. The actions involve considerable expansion of covert
                            operations in Laos and will certainly call for increased expenditure of
                            funds and the assignment of some additional personnel. It is impossible
                            to give a specific estimate of such increases at this time because of
                            the generality of the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>5. During the drafting of this memorandum, Agency representatives urged
                            upon the drafting group the inclusion of a course of action calling for
                            an expansion of the Defended Village Program in Laos, already undertaken
                            under Phase I. The other members of the drafting group felt that this
                            being merely an expansion of a program currently authorized it need not
                            be mentioned as a specific course of action for which additional
                            Presidential authority was required. We recommend that the DCI call the
                            Standing Group's attention to this matter when the memorandum is
                            submitted to it, as the earlier approved action has actually not been
                            fully implemented due in part to an emphasis on avoiding violations of
                            the Geneva Agreements.</p>
                        <p>6. With respect to actions to be undertaken outside of Laos, the most
                            significant are the deployment of additional U.S. combat forces to
                            Thailand and the movement of an aircraft carrier group to the coast of
                            South Vietnam. In addition certain diplomatic actions are proposed which
                            in effect consist of bringing our friends into our confidence and
                            gaining their support for these actions and warning our opponents of the
                            seriousness of our purpose.</p>

                        <p>The situation within Laos itself is now somewhat less threatening than it
                            was a week ago, although the Communists continue to occupy the area in
                            central Laos into which they had been moving. Our discussions of the
                            problems confronting us in Southeast Asia have, however, only
                            re-enforced our judgment that we should move promptly to counteract the
                            widespread speculation on neutralist solutions for the area and to
                            reassert US determination to exert its power effectively to frustrate
                            Communist advances there. The continued flagrant Communist violation of
                            the Geneva Accords<note n="4" xml:id="d6fn4">For texts of the

                                Accords), July 23, 1962, see American Foreign Policy: Current
                                Documents, 1962, pp. 1075–1083.</note> in Laos provides us with the
                            clearest and most understandable immediate issue on which to base
                            actions to these ends.</p>
                        <p>The draft Memorandum sets forth a broad program of political, military
                            and covert actions designed to have an immediate impact upon the
                            situation in Laos as well as to convey a mounting sense of US
                            determination to do whatever is necessary in Southeast Asia generally to
                            defend Free World interests. This program is not specifically aimed at
                            preparing us for any particular military courses of action with respect
                            to Laos, South Viet-Nam or North Viet-Nam which may commend themselves
                            to <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0046"/>us at some point in the
                            future. Nor is it designed to pre-judge decisions on such military
                            courses of action. If the program is successfully carried out, we would
                            expect the Communist side to be substantially more cautious in taking
                            actions which could force us to make these difficult decisions and we
                            would expect our friends in the area to take new heart. In any case, we
                            will be in no worse a position to face the possible difficult decisions
                            on military courses of action if events eventually require them.</p>
                        <p>We do not feel that it is possible at this point to be too precise on the
                            details of the various actions included in the program. Close and
                            continuing consultations between the agencies concerned will be required
                            as the various steps are taken. At all times we must keep in mind the
                            sensitivities and interests of our friends who are most directly
                            concerned, particularly the Thai and the Lao. Undoubtedly, we shall have
                            to tailor some of our actions to fit their desires. What is important,
                            however, is the general concept of coordinated political, military and
                            covert actions—within the limits set forth in the Memorandum—as a means
                            of achieving a limited and essentially political end.</p>
                        <p>I also attach a paper setting forth—in broad outline—our view of how we
                            might expect the proposed program to be implemented.</p>

                        <p>The Communists may well see an opportunity for broad forward movement in
                            the recent course of events in Southeast Asia. The political climate is
                            dominated by widespread speculation on neutralist solutions for the area
                            sparked by France's recognition of Communist China and DeGaulle's
                            statements as well as Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>'s efforts to obtain international guarantees of
                            Cambodian neutrality by threatening to turn to Hanoi and Peiping. The
                            Communists may well believe that the United States is unwilling to exert
                            its power effectively to defend its positions in <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0047"/>Southeast Asia. They, as well as
                            DeGaulle and <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>, must be
                            disabused to any such ideas; and our friends, especially the Thais and
                            Vietnamese, must be reassured as to our determination and
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>In our view the recent Communist advances in central Laos highlight the
                            continuing erosion of the situation in Laos. We have a clear and
                            understandable immediate issue—the continued flagrant Communist
                            violation of the Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Objectives</p>
                        <p>With respect to Laos, we must undertake a series of coordinated political
                            and military actions designed (1) to discourage the Communist side from
                            continued advances against the neutralist/conservative forces, (2) to
                            give us additional time to augment the efforts we have been making to
                            strengthen and consolidate areas under the control of
                            neutralist/conservative forces, and (3) to preserve our freedom of
                            action in responding to any further actions undertaken by the
                            Communists. The actions we propose do not involve committing U.S. forces
                            to Laos.</p>
                        <p>In the broader context of Southeast Asia, our actions must be designed to
                            give the Communist side reason to believe that we are prepared to
                            escalate the conflict in the area in order to defend our positions
                            there. Our actions should in no way foreclose options we may later wish
                            to pursue with respect to South Viet-Nam or North Viet-Nam as well as
                            Laos. Communist concern should be reinforced by gradually accumulating
                            evidence of our willingness to support actions against North Viet-Nam
                            itself under the presently approved plan (OPLAN 34–A–64)<note n="6" xml:id="d6fn6">See <ref target="frus1964-68v01">

                                I, pp. 4–5.</note> or on a more extensive scale. We should make it
                            clear that our actions stem from our concern over the situation in
                            Southeast Asia as a whole, and that our actions with respect to Thailand
                            and Laos are indeed coordinated with our assistance to South
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>While none of the actions we propose is decisive in itself, a number of
                            them taken together should represent some actual increase in United
                            States military capability within Southeast Asia and demonstrate our
                            concern over the course of recent events together with our determination
                            to reverse that course.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Reconvening of Geneva Conference?</p>
                        <p>We do not propose to reconvene the Geneva Conference on Laos at this
                            time. Nevertheless, the Communist side could do so, and Prince Souvanna
                            might if he became extremely discouraged over the situation in Laos.
                            Moreover, at some future time, it might actually be in our interest that
                            a conference be held. In any event, the measures which we are proposing
                                <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0048"/>would tend to put us in a
                            stronger position to participate effectively in such a Conference should
                            one occur.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Regional Cooperation</p>
                        <p>In view of Souvanna's key importance in the Geneva settlement, it is
                            essential to coordinate closely with him, obtaining his support or tacit
                            acquiescence.</p>
                        <p>Because Thailand is an avenue for introducing U.S. power, we must obtain
                            full Thai cooperation and support, consulting in advance and treating
                            the Thai as partners.</p>
                        <p>This coordination is particularly important because both Souvanna and the
                            Thai may have reservations on varying specific actions to be taken.
                            Their reaction will be conditioned by the intensity of Communist
                            pressures and our willingness to meet them squarely.</p>
                        <p>The actions we propose will not in themselves cause Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> to accelerate his timetable to
                            threats unless they are executed in such a manner as to cause suspicion
                            that they are directed against Cambodia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendations:</p>
                        <p>1. That we resume the US program of graduated actions which were
                            contained in the memorandum for the President attached to <gloss target="#t_NSAM1">NSAM</gloss> 256 of July 31, 1963.<note n="7" xml:id="d6fn7">See <ref target="#d5fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                5</ref>.</note> Specifically, it is recommended that the following
                            actions be taken promptly (exact timing to be determined by the
                            Department of State with the concurrence of the Department of
                            Defense):</p>
                        <p>a. With regard to Laos:</p>
                        <p>(1) Encourage selective use of 6 Lao T–28s.<note n="8" xml:id="d6fn8">Actions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of Group A of Phase II. [Footnote in the

                        </p>
                        <p>(2) Expand use of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] other specialist covert teams.</p>
                        <p>(3) Resume use of South Vietnamese border patrols to conduct guerrilla
                            operations in south Laos against the Viet Minh.</p>
                        <p>(4) Further enlarge guerrilla units in Laos and expand operations in
                            enemy held territory.</p>
                        <p>(5) Expand sabotage operations against the North Vietnamese within Laos
                            and in areas of North Viet-Nam adjacent to Laos by guerrillas launched
                            from Laos.</p>
                        <p>(6) Conduct high level aerial photo reconnaissance of Laos<note n="9" xml:id="d6fn9">Action No. 1 of Group C of Phase II. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> (timing as mutually agreed by Department of
                            State and Department of Defense).</p>
                        <p>b. With regard to the deployment of U.S. forces, deploy promptly to
                            Thailand the remainder of the F–100 squadron, approximately 12, which
                            currently has a detachment of 6 there. A decision as to the deployment
                            of additional forces, with composition to be recommended by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0049"/>will be deferred until after the forthcoming conference in
                            Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>c. It is recommended that the current Joint US/Thai Special Warfare
                            Exercise in Thailand be expanded or extended as feasible.</p>
                        <p>2. That, together with the foregoing measures, we move in the diplomatic
                            arena (a) to reassure our allies as to our intentions to stand by US
                            commitments in Southeast Asia, (b) to indicate that the US is
                            considering further measures for coping with Communist aggression in the
                            area, (c) to produce evidence of North Vietnamese intervention in Laos
                            and South Viet-Nam. Among the diplomatic measures to be taken, we
                            will:</p>
                        <p>(a) Publicize fully Communist actions in Laos in violation of the Geneva
                            Accords.</p>
                        <p>(b) Consult with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                            in order (1) to convince him of our intention to prevent the Communists
                            from destroying the Geneva settlement and to uphold the position of his
                            government and (2) to obtain his support or tacit acquiescence in our
                            course of action.</p>
                        <p>(c) Consult fully with Thailand keeping in mind Thai sensitivities
                            regarding decisions affecting their interests taken unilaterally by the
                            US. Continue to encourage the Thai to strengthen their military forces
                            in Northeast Thailand.</p>
                        <p>(d) Coordinate with Thailand the extent and character of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> approval and involvement.</p>
                        <p>(e) Obtain maximum support and contributions from the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>(f) Urge the British to go to the Soviets again urgently and demand
                            Co-Chairmen action in support of Souvanna. If the Soviets continue to
                            stall, the British should issue a unilateral statement in reply to
                            Souvanna's appeal.</p>
                        <p>(g) Follow up the British approach with a direct approach of our own to
                            the Soviet Co-Chairman. We should also speak to the Poles.</p>
                        <p>(h) Inform the Indian and Canadian governments and their <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Commissioners of our projected actions,
                            and continue to press them for more forceful action in the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Since the solution to the Laotian problem is intimately linked with
                            the solution to South Viet-Nam and its relationship to North Viet-Nam,
                            it is recommended that the Laotian and South Vietnamese problems be
                            discussed further in conjunction following the return of Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General

                        <p>If the program is approved, we envisage implementing it along the
                            following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. Begin immediately to publish in increasing detail information about
                            the Communist actions in Laos during the past two years in violation of
                            the Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <p>2. Initiate prompt discussions with the Thais in order to gain their full
                            understanding of our broad purposes and our intent to use the situation
                            in Laos as the immediate cause for action. Our discussions with the
                            Thais will cover the question of how to manage the extent and character
                            of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> acquiescence, approval, or
                            involvement in the actions we will jointly be taking with Thailand. We
                            should be prepared to modify our proposed program in order to obtain
                            maximum Thai collaboration and understanding. Although Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> believes that Thai
                            cooperation will depend upon our assurances that we are prepared to
                            enter Laos if necessary, it should be possible to obtain their full
                            cooperation on the general concept we pursue without explicit statement
                            as to what we might do in response to hypothetical Communist advances in
                            Laos. We should, of course, be prepared to indicate that the option of
                            using US forces in Laos remains open.</p>
                        <p>It will be absolutely essential that no leak regarding our proposed
                            program occur before discussions with the Thais have begun.</p>
                        <p>3. After consulting with the Thais, we should tell <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> of the general nature
                            of our proposed actions with emphasis upon our determination to be
                            ready, under whatever circumstances, to defend the position of his
                            government under the Geneva Accords. Since he will not believe that the
                            situation in Laos itself really demands this kind of action on our part,
                            we should be prepared to philosophize with him about the threat which
                            Communist activities centered in North Viet-Nam offer to Free World
                            positions in Southeast Asia generally.</p>
                        <p>4. Having talked to the Thais and while we are discussing matters with
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, we should
                            seek maximum political and military support for our actions from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, New Zealand, and the
                            Philippines. The manner of approaching these governments will depend
                            upon the agreements we have reached with the Thais regarding <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> involvement.</p>

                            will begin promptly to implement the Phase II actions with respect to
                            Laos. Those actions which are entirely covert will be pushed vigorously
                            as soon as authorized. Others, such as offensive use of T–28s, will
                            demand careful tailoring to Souvanna's sensibilities as the situation
                            develops. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                            subject, the Department of State revised the Draft Memorandum for the
                                President<note n="2" xml:id="d7fn2">See attachment 1 to <ref target="#d6">Document 6</ref>.</note> in preparation for your

                        <p>The revised Memorandum (Tab A) forwarded to us by State calls for early
                            implementation of the measures listed in the previous memorandum except
                            that U.S. force deployment at this time is limited to the remainder (12
                            aircraft) of the F–100 squadron which currently has a 6-aircraft
                            detachment in Thailand. A decision on additional U.S. deployments is to
                            be deferred until your return from Saigon.</p>

                        <p>The new draft is in accord with views of <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> and, with one exception, those of the Joint Chiefs. The
                            Joint Chiefs recommend the resumption of low level aerial reconnaissance

                            its implementation would require a policy determination to the effect
                            that the U.S. is no longer willing to permit unilateral violation by the
                            Communist side.</p>
                        <p>Arguments for the deployment of the F–100's at this time are:</p>
                        <p>a. It might have some impact as an indication of our willingness to take
                            action in the area.</p>
                        <p>b. It is keyed specifically to Laos.</p>
                        <p>c. It would probably be more acceptable to the Thais than would U.S.
                            ground force deployments.</p>
                        <p>d. It represents a threat against both <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM troop movements and Laotian supply routes from North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Arguments against are that by itself the action does not mean very much,
                            it may have lost some credibility because we have done it before without
                            taking further steps, and it is a card we might want to play later.</p>
                        <p>On balance, the argument which seems most persuasive is that deployment
                            of U.S. aircraft would be a positive action which we could take
                            immediately and which might have some deterrent impact on the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM.</p>

                        <p>“It is my impression that, at our meeting yesterday, there was general
                            agreement upon the desirability of strengthening the overt US military
                            posture in Thailand in ways designed to counteract the increasing trend
                            towards speculation about US intentions in Southeast Asia and the
                            possibility of neutralist solutions. At the time [the meeting of
                            February 26], we could not and did not feel that the situation in Laos
                            necessarily injected an element of urgency into our considerations.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName> stated in the February 27
                            memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that, in light
                            of the fall of the Phou Khe mountain complex commanding the southern

                        </list>
                        <p>Following your February 26 meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> on Laos, we have received
                            reports from Ambassador Unger <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0054"/>that the Phou Khe mountain complex commanding the southern approach to
                            the Plaine des Jarres has fallen to Communist artillery assault. This
                            Communist success puts them in a position to move effectively against
                            the Plaine des Jarres and to dominate the routes southward toward Tha
                            Thom. Although Souvanna has already asked the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to take appropriate action to restore the situation as
                            soon as possible, we can have no assurance that the Communist side will
                            not continue to advance against neutralist/conservative positions in
                            both northern and central Laos.</p>
                        <p>This is a serious new development. It is typical Pathet Lao/Viet Minh
                            tactics to strike and then wait for our reaction; if we do not react,
                            then they strike again. Conversely, when we have reacted, these
                            Communist salami tactics have been checked. Under the circumstances, I
                            believe that we cannot afford to delay on a decision to introduce
                            additional US forces into Thailand, bearing in mind that the other
                            recommendations in our Laos action plan will not be sufficient to warn
                            and deter the Pathet Lao/Viet Minh.</p>
                        <p>We understand from Bill Bundy this morning that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> shares our concern over this
                            latest Communist advance at Phou Khe and is prepared to move ahead with
                            quietly introducing 12 more F–100's into Thailand, bringing our squadron
                            there to full strength of 18 aircraft.</p>
                        <p>I agree that we should proceed with the F–100 deployment, although we
                            would first have to notify the Thais in the context of our larger plan
                            for Laos.</p>
                        <p>However, I also believe that we should now make the decision to proceed
                            with some US ground force deployment to Thailand. I do not suggest that
                            it be a full battle group but could, as <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> suggested at our meeting, be half that
                            size. It might also be desirable that the ground forces be introduced
                            shortly after the F–100s. Such phasing would give us more time to
                            discuss and coordinate with the Thais, without holding up on the
                            F–100s.</p>

                        <p>1. That we now decide to deploy promptly to Thailand 12 more F–100
                            aircraft to bring the squadron to full strength of 18;</p>

                        <p>2. That we decide as soon as possible in favor of moving some ground
                            forces to Thailand at an early date following the introduction of the
                            F–100s;</p>
                        <p>3. That we authorize Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> immediately to consult fully with the Thais along
                            the lines indicated in the draft memorandum to the President, including

                        <p>At the instruction of the Department of State, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy D. Kohler</persName> met in Moscow with Soviet
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Andrei A.
                                Gromyko</persName> on February 28, 1964, and informed him that the
                            United State was disappointed with the Soviet Union's performance as
                            Co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated that the United States
                            was particularly disturbed that the Soviet Union did not support Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s call
                            for International Control Commission action against Pathet Lao attacks
                            at Phou Khe in Xieng Khouang province, a clear violation of the
                            cease-fire. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that
                            the Soviet Union stood by the Geneva Accords; and that current problems
                            in Laos were basically minor internal differences. When <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> took <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> to task for this statement, the Soviet
                            Minister—according to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>—stated “somewhat sheepishly” that “it seems we are
                            doing what we can.” The report of the <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>

                        <p>On February 27 at 4 p.m. in Washington, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> took advantage of another
                            conversation with Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> to make a similar protest about lack of Soviet
                            support for <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and
                            performance of the Commission. Two days later on February 29, Under

                                suggested that while the “Geneva umbrella” handicapped U.S. actions
                                in coping with Communist efforts to subvert the settlement of 1962,
                                at the same time, it “serves to keep Laos under an international
                                spotlight, to provide some instruments for bringing international
                                pressure to bear, to broaden the support for its economy and its
                                neutrality, and, I believe, to circumscribe to some degree Communist
                                choices for action.” Unger stated that the “balance between handicap
                                and advantage” favored continuation of present U.S. policy.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, POL 1–1 LAOS)</note> that this
                            continues to be our policy, even though we may be prepared shade it
                            somewhat more than in past; if this not the case, what follows of course
                            does not apply.</p>
                        <p>Numbered para 3 under recommendations refers to “solution” to Laotian
                            problem. Given ground rules under which we have been operating here I
                            have not considered it realistic to expect that we could arrive at any
                            definitive solution in Laos at any early date.</p>
                        <p>Instead we have been working here toward limited objective of:</p>
                        <p>1) Keeping Geneva structure intact as far as possible against day when
                            some progress could be made toward full pacification and unification of
                            country and acceptance throughout territory of authority Vientiane
                            government; impossible guess how remote this may be but certainly
                            unlikely as long as there is no solution South Viet-Nam;</p>
                        <p>2) Meanwhile concentrating on friendly (i.e. conservative-neutralist)
                            zone of Laos to preserve its integrity as far as possible and build up
                            its stability and internal security.</p>
                        <p>Thus immediate problem of Laos is one of preserving integrity and
                            stability this zone against limited Communist military and para military
                            actions which have as their present objective not taking over entire
                            friendly zone but rather paring that zone down so that all that remains
                                <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0057"/>are points taking of which
                            would in Communist view precipitate unacceptable reaction, particularly
                            by US. Central threat to this zone is Viet Minh support, without which
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> containable.</p>
                        <p>If fundamental US objective in Laos is simply to defend Mekong lowland
                            because of importance to security Thailand then our policy should be to
                            keep Communists clearly on notice that encroachments on places like
                            Thakhek will provoke reaction from us which unacceptable to them. Beyond
                            that we would not need to be unduly concerned about loss hinterland
                            territory as long as towns and connecting roads along Mekong, including
                            Ban Houei Sai area, in friendly hands and there remains government in
                            Vientiane which in critical situation could ask for free world help and
                            provide foothold on Laotian side Mekong as base of operations for such
                            help.</p>
                        <p>If fundamental objective goes beyond that outlined in preceding paragraph
                            and envisages preservation of Laos as country in friendly hands (albeit
                            neutral) then we can ill afford to see Communist nibbling proceed much
                            beyond what it has already taken. Otherwise friendly zone will be cut
                            down to point where inadequate provide base for regeneration. Presume
                            this describes what is in fact our present holding policy.</p>
                        <p>If fundamental objective for present period also includes interdiction
                            use Ho Chi Minh Trail by getting it out of Communist and into friendly
                            hands, then present policy entirely inadequate; moreover I am persuaded
                            this cannot be accomplished without commiting substantial US forces to
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>In contemplating actions to be taken Laos we must focus again on
                            philosophy Prime Minister Souvanna in view his key importance to
                            question. His fundamental objective for Laos has been and remains to
                            remove it from field of East-West conflict. While he does not wish
                            communism for Laos, and presumably also not for other countries
                            Southeast Asia, he has much more confidence in possibility avoid this
                            through neutralization and policies such as those pursued by <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> than we do. While he may share
                            our concern over situation Southeast Asia as a whole he is not
                            sympathetic to having our actions with respect to Laos coordinated with
                            those regarding Thailand and South Viet-Nam and influenced by very
                            different international status and orientation those countries.</p>
                        <p>(See my letter Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>

                            Souvanna believes story in Lao proverb that when buffaloes fight it is
                            grass which gets hurt and however much he now understands more clearly
                            nature of Communist threat and tactics, he remains persuaded Laos will
                            only suffer more from being made scene of escalated conflict. I would
                            therefore <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0058"/>expect him adamantly

                        <p>Whenever we consider adopting stronger military actions in Laos we also
                            come up against inescapable fact that friendly armed forces in Laos are
                            woefully limited in their capabilities, as has recently been amply
                            demonstrated. Believe over time they can be made capable of protecting
                            friendly zone Laos before too much more whittled away, if they have
                            support such as recommended Embtel 846<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn5">In

                            involved, every action taken in Laos which in any sense appears to

                        <p>All of diplomatic measures proposed appear useful although recent Soviet,

                            much improvement in those quarters. As regards recommendation 2–B, do
                            not believe we can equate <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> can be expected go along with
                            virtually all proposals leading toward escalation since we believe his
                            fundamental objective is to bring about deeper US involvement, including
                            use of US troops. If we followed his advice but were not ultimately
                            prepared commit US troops, then I believe we would be inviting disaster.
                            I believe it is <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s honest
                            conviction, as well as a position motivated by personal considerations,
                            that in last analysis only military action with strong free world
                            support can save Laos from communism.</p>
                        <p>I believe we must clear with Souvanna all actions which are likely to
                            come to his attention; otherwise we would quickly shatter considerable
                            confidence he now has in our sincere and unreserved support of
                            neutralist solution for Laos. I believe this includes virtually
                            everything proposed except perhaps some actions in most remote
                            southeastern areas of country within perhaps twenty-five kilometers of
                            South Vietnamese frontier. Most matters need clearance from <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> from practical point of view
                            since cooperation <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and local
                            officials frequently involved; moreover <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> understandably resents US acting unilaterally in
                            Laos as of course does Souvanna, if not more so. Low level photo
                            reconnaissance flights seem to me almost sure to become known and I
                            would not consider their initiation without consultation with Souvanna,

                                Detachment was a proposal of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to deploy
                                four T–28's and pilots and 30 to 40 support personnel in Thailand.
                                The detachment could augment the Royal Lao Air Force in the event of
                                a serious offensive by the Pathet Lao/North Vietnamese, assist the

                                and employment of T–28's in Laos, and give impetus to Thai
                                up-country development programs and counterinsurgency efforts. It
                                would also serve as an adequate cover to justify the presence of
                                U.S. T–28's in Thailand. (Letter from <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Hilsman</persName>, January 11; ibid., DEF 19 US–LAOS) On March

                            But these efforts will take time.</p>
                        <p>In addition to factors of Lao performance, effectiveness of T–28's
                            limited by restrictions on armament and BT factors of timing. The margin
                            of utility of bombs (including 500-pounders) over rockets derives from
                            nature of warfare in Laos—absence of large troop concentrations,
                            particular importance of artillery and armor to outcome of fighting, and
                            exposure of slow aircraft to ground fire during high-angle attack
                            required with rockets or machine guns. Timing presents multiple
                            problems: 1) several days frequently elapse between request for strike
                            and completion necessary military planning and approval; 2) required
                            U.S. consultation (sometimes including referral to Washington) adds
                            delay at minimum and apparently has discouraged <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> to point that
                            fuzes are no longer requested, in expectation of refusal; 3) present
                            need to clear individual actions with Souvanna requires additional
                            time.</p>
                        <p>We therefore believe early step-up in deterrent effect or in <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/ neutralist capability to contain
                            Communist attacks by air activity requires relaxation in restraints
                            currently imposed on use of aircraft and bombs and grant of greater
                            discretionary authority to Lao. We specifically recommend:</p>
                        <p>1) Turning over limited number of bomb fuzes to <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> on understanding that they are to be used for
                            defensive purposes in consultation with us as to types of targets and
                            that replacement of fuzes obviously conditional on evidence of prudent
                            and effective use; 2) introducing 500-pound bombs to make strikes
                            effective against targets such as those suggested in section II below;
                            3) broadening approved uses of T–28's. For present we recommend
                            retaining napalm containers in Thailand; Lao are not trained in
                            sophisticated use of napalm and random use seems politically
                            unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>Under this proposal, I would need to obtain Souvanna's advance approval
                            for release of fuzes and his understanding of tactical concept (below),
                            but decision to undertake individual missions would become Lao
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>II. Tactical Concept. Our guidance to <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>
                            and neutralists for use of T–28's, to be discussed and agreed in
                            advance, would continue to emphasize use of aircraft, bombs or not, for
                            defensive purposes only, but defining defense to include both reprisal
                            for aggressive actions and interdiction of build-up for attack.</p>
                        <p>1. Specific recommendations to <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            would depend on circumstances following completion of Washington's
                            review of overall policy. As general proposition, believe we should
                            initially stress step-up of visual and photo reconnaissance and a
                            substantial road-cratering effort on principal lines of supply from
                            North Viet-Nam into Laos. Road-cratering (principally routes 7, 8 and
                            12) commends itself because A) it is measure which comes as close as any
                            available to isolating Viet Minh support from indigenous Pathet Lao
                            effort, and it is Viet Minh who threaten precarious balance of power in
                            Laos; B) it requires less expertise than finding and hitting moving
                            targets and thus provides reasonable intermediate test of <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> capabilities; C) chagrin would be
                            principal cost of failure; and D) success would have marked effect in
                            reducing pressure on front-line units.</p>
                        <p>2. Other targets or operations which are currently appealing include:</p>
                        <p>A) Three known artillery positions used in occasional harassing fire
                            against Kong Le headquarters at Muong Phan;</p>
                        <p>B) Support of guerrilla operations (cover/diversion) principally in Xieng
                            Khouang province and designed, as road-cutting, to reduce front-line
                            pressure;</p>
                        <p>C) In-bound convoys;</p>
                        <p>D) Supply depots in combat areas (one such located east of Khang Khay
                            cannot be touched with rockets due surrounding anti-aircraft but could
                            be taken out by low-level bombing);</p>
                        <p>E) Armor, wherever found;</p>
                        <p>F) Phou Khe and adjacent artillery positions, in connection with possible
                            operations for its recapture.</p>
                        <p>III. Cautions. Preceding recommendations are advanced, and should only be
                            approved with recognition of accompanying reservations:</p>
                        <p>1. Use of bombs and less discriminate use of aircraft would represent a
                            degree of escalation. Moreover, escalation danger not manageable in
                            detail since Lao would have control over operations subject only to
                            threat of withholding replacement weapons, and this introduces hazards
                            of some dimensions. We cannot surely predict whether first use of bombs
                            will have deterrent or inflammatory effect, and see no way to a
                            determination short of having a few test cases.</p>
                        <p>2. Improved armament will not make the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> a sophisticated air force. We do not believe that six
                            T–28's, whatever their equipment, will tip the balance in favor of
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and neutralists against the
                            Pathet Lao/Viet Minh <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0063"/>forces they
                            confront except, possibly, in specific tactical situations. Even this
                            exception assumes relatively skillful use of equipment by virtually
                            untried pilots.</p>
                        <p>3. Expansion in use of T–28's will require active role by <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> personnel in advisory capacity with respect to target
                            selection, mission planning, and coordination. It will probably require
                            a kind of on-the-spot surveillance of work of aircraft armorers, by
                                <gloss target="#t_RO1">RO</gloss> personnel, that would be visible
                            to any observers at bases (presumably Vientiane and Savannakhet) from
                            which combat strikes launched. (French are already sensitive to role of
                            U.S. personnel presently at Savannakhet.)</p>
                        <p>Initiation of <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> bombing program
                            should be preceded or accompanied by effort to arrange with <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> for use of bombing range in Thailand
                            to permit evaluation of <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            performance by U.S. observers.</p>

                        <p>1705Z. Following is a report from the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            Station Chief in Saigon;</p>
                        <p>1. General Khiem called me late on 16 March, told me he and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> met with Phoumi
                            Nosovan in Dalat on Saturday 14 March and came to agreement in principle
                            on three major matters:</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, using marked or unmarked
                            aircraft, can bomb and strafe <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>
                            installations at Tchepone, Muong Nong, Muong Phine, Saravane, and in the
                            Boulovens area generally. Khiem seemed eager to take this on right away
                            because “we can catch the Soviet Chinese aircraft that are now
                            there”.</p>
                        <p>B. In the eastern portions of Laos south of Tchepone to the Cambodian
                            border, <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> may conduct military
                            operations up to and including regimental size in areas mutually agreed
                            as being principally under <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> or
                            Communist control.</p>
                        <p>C. General Vang Pao, now in Xieng Khouang, will provide and safeguard, in
                            the area bordering NVN due east of Xieng Khouang, a base of operations
                            for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> commando or special forces units
                            to raid across the line into the NVN salient containing Route 7.</p>
                        <p>2. Khiem also said that <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>
                            would pick an Ambassador to Vientiane by the end of this week, but that
                            one has not yet been chosen. Would let me know as soon as one picked. He
                            further said that if action described para one C came to pass, would
                            want liaison with US in Vientiane. Also said that at same time as new
                            Ambassador went to Vientiane, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would
                            establish five-man military liaison team with Laotian forces at
                            Savannakhet.</p>
                        <p>3. Related all of above to Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> who expressed his warm approval of <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> proposals given above. He asked that
                            substance this conversation, plus his agreement, be passed to State
                            Dept. General Khiem emphasized that all agreements were in principle,
                            and that, while some planning was being done, they would not implement
                            any of the agreements described in para one without American agreement
                            and support. This cable therefore becomes their means of seeking
                            official U.S. govt reaction and response. Await your comment.</p>
                        <p>4. Had suggested to Amb <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> that
                            substance this conversation be transmitted as regular Embassy telegram,
                            but he prefers that it be reported as it is.</p>

                            Advise soonest timing. If <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            has already seen Souvanna Ambassador should see him also and inform him
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> aware of proposals.</p>
                        <p>2. Our own preliminary views are that several of the points agreed
                            between <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> could be put into effect at an
                            early stage. We would heartily endorse the assignment of an Ambassador
                            to Vientiane and would agree to the covert establishment of a 5-man
                            military liaison team with Laotian forces at Savannakhet. We would also
                            feel that the establishment of a liaison with the US in Vientiane could
                            be executed even before the commando action east of Xieng Khouang is
                            mounted.</p>
                        <p>3. Our thoughts on the commando action along route 7 would be not to
                            discourage it but to be certain that the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> feels confident it could be mounted from a Meo base and
                            could fit into the general pattern of Plan 34 A.</p>
                        <p>4. On the other hand, we feel that air strikes on the targets named (some

                            size military operations in areas under Communist control would involve
                            drastic changes in Laotian situation and specifically would breach
                            underlying understanding that, until Geneva Accords can be fully
                            applied, territorial control of the respective parties should remain as
                            it stood at the time of the Laos Accord in July 1962. Thus, <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0066"/>proven Communist (i.e., Pathet Lao)
                            control of territory in the Laos panhandle is not ipso facto cause for
                            retaliatory action out of Viet-Nam. In other words, actions proposed in
                            paras 1 A and 1 B of reference message might will cause <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> to assume that we were
                            no longer supporting the Geneva and related accords on Laos and
                            therefore to abdicate. Moreover, the result could be to invite Communist
                            retaliation in Laos, that would almost certainly take the form of early
                            introduction of North Vietnamese units (as in Na Kay plateau during
                            January) and could readily set in motion a major chain of events. We
                            therefore believe action along these lines should not be undertaken
                            unless and until we were ready to move to considerably more drastic
                            action in the area as a whole and had made specific preparations
                            including such action as the introduction of substantial US ground
                            forces into Thailand.</p>
                        <p>5. Above preliminary views should be used as background by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> in sounding out

                            preliminary views, we recognize possibility that we may obtain hard
                            intelligence of North Vietnamese activity that would present worthwhile
                            targets. In absence such intelligence, operations such as proposed seem
                            to us to offer very limited chance of fruitful results in any case. If
                            and when we get such intelligence, we would be prepared to re-examine
                            question of selective specific operations into Laos, but even these
                            would still have to be weighed for their military advantage as against
                            the possibility that they would disrupt our current posture in Southeast
                            Asia before we have a clear and firm plan for graduated pressures that
                            would take account of possible responses both in Laos and with reference
                            to North Viet-Nam. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>

                                <ref target="#d16">Document 16</ref>.</note> This morning I
                            congratulated PriMin Souvanna on resumption diplomatic relations with
                            South Viet Nam and then <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0067"/>referred
                            to <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s March 14 Dalat meeting
                            with Gen <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>, noting that we
                            have also been in touch with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on
                            various propositions discussed at that time. I said I presumed Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> had reviewed these
                            matters with Souvanna but I wanted also go over them since we wished to
                            have his views.</p>
                        <p>Before I had proceeded very far Souvanna asked me whether there were any
                            secret agreements between <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>. It emerged as we reviewed
                            proposals that <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> had touched
                            on discussions with <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> in
                            briefest and most general terms and Souvanna was almost entirely unaware
                            of specific proposals. He said while it true that area of action under
                            discussion adjoins <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s zone,
                            Souvanna nevertheless is ultimately responsible for all actions in Laos
                            with international implications. He also referred to his forthcoming
                            trip to Hanoi and Peking,<note n="3" xml:id="d17fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s trip, April
                                2–8.</note> acknowledging that he does not know how much he can
                            accomplish there, but pointing out that aggressive actions involving
                            South Vietnamese, like some of those contemplated, would certainly
                            assure complete failure his mission. He said he could envisage situation
                            in which actions of sort contemplated would have to be taken if it clear
                            all hope of realizing neutral solution of Laos is lost. At this point he
                            would probably invite U.S. to come to his country's aid to avoid its
                            falling to Communists, at which point he would himself probably withdraw
                            from scene, but this moment has not arrived and he still means continue
                            make maximum efforts achieve peaceful solution and hopes we will
                            continue support him in this.</p>
                        <p>I told Souvanna it was precisely because of our firm intention to
                            continue supporting him that I had opened with him discussion Dalat
                            proposals. Although Gen <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> had
                            told me several times he had cleared these matters with Souvanna I
                            desired and my government had specifically instructed me to ascertain
                            PriMin's attitude on those matters which directly affected Laos before
                            determining our own position. I said I would report his views fully on
                            each of proposals, adding there might be those instances where we felt
                            some action was of overriding importance and not entailing too serious
                            risks, in which case I would raise matter with him again.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized to Souvanna that our concern lay not only with Communist
                            actions against neutralist and conservatives in Laos but also with South
                            Viet Nam's struggle to preserve its independence, and I hoped that in
                            his Hanoi and Peking visits he could protest not only against the
                            actions taken to undermine <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> but also
                            the violation of Laotian territory committed by North Viet Nam to pursue
                            its subversive war in the south. Souvanna said “we are all fully aware
                            of what is going on” and <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0068"/>that
                            this has been subject of his repeated protests to North Vietnamese Amb
                            here and will certainly be pressed in Hanoi and Peking.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna then requested me to ask Washington for its suggestions as to
                            what line he might possibly pursue in Hanoi and Peking in order explore
                            whether there are in fact any grounds for constructive negotiations or
                            compromise to improve situations Laos, Viet Nam and South East Asia in

                                encourage Souvanna to protest to leaders in Hanoi and Peking their
                                governments' support of the Pathet Lao, the Viet Cong's use of Laos
                                for attacks on South Vietnam, and to express willingness to accept

                                that Souvanna would also stress that the United States had no
                                territorial ambitions or desire for bases in Laos. (Both Department
                                of State, Central Files, POL 7 LAOS)</note> He said he would of
                            course put forward any ideas we might offer entirely as his own and make
                            no mention of US, but if he knew what kinds of adjustments might have
                            chance of being acceptable to us then his talks might be more useful
                            than otherwise.</p>

                            refDeptel, Souvanna's reactions were as follows:</p>
                        <p>(1) He accepted without comment idea of establishing covert five-man

                            Savannakhet.</p>
                        <p>(2) With regard to air actions, for example at Tchepone, this brought
                            immediate negative reaction from Souvanna who said this would promptly
                            put Laos question back on war footing and he specifically asked this not
                            be done. As a variant, to be invoked if Communist pressures increase in
                            future, I asked what he would think of augmenting present T–28 fleet
                            with additional planes painted with Lao markings flown by South
                            Vietnamese, perhaps with Lao passports. Souvanna indicated his readiness
                            consider something of this nature if situation should deteriorate
                            badly.</p>
                        <p>(3) He accepts modest (not anything like regimental scale) cross border
                            operations in southeastern part of Laos, particularly if units made up

                            Laotian territory and if penetrations not too deep. (See airgram

                        <p>(4) I did not raise question commando action along Route 7 in North
                            Vietnam from Meo base in Laos since plan 34A mentioned ref Deptel not
                                <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0069"/>available here. I deferred
                            this point also because of Souvanna's special sensitivity with regard
                            Meo as well as question my mind what benefit to US objectives North Viet
                            Nam to be gained from action in NVN salient containing Route 7. If
                            objective is to interdict use this route against Laos, believe we can
                            proceed on basis plans which <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss>, and Embassy develops and

                        <p>(5) I did not raise question aerial photos, not knowing what relation
                            this proposal bore to already agreed high level US aerial photography
                            and, if not the same, what kinds of planes, pilots and which areas
                            envisaged.</p>
                        <p>At conclusion our conversation it was evident Souvanna pleased we had
                            consulted him and asked me be sure that actions to which he had objected
                            would not be undertaken. He made clear he was particularly concerned
                            nothing be done to render useless in advance his Hanoi and Peking
                            visits, although it also seemed clear regardless their outcome he most
                            unlikely agree to bombing and strafing Tchepone and other points.</p>
                        <p>At same time Souvanna stated he has no intention letting Communists take
                            over Laos and although his objective is be able live in peace side by
                            side with Communist neighbors, if this not possible and Communists
                            attempt takeover, then only answer is war and he would hope US would
                            help.</p>

                        <p>On April 2, 1964, from 12:35 to 2:54 p.m., President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met with Secretary of State

                            President's Daily Diary) No record of the discussion has been found, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Michael Forrestal</persName> prepared on

                                Bundy</persName> with an annotated agenda for the meeting. Item 5
                            (of 6) of the <persName>Bundy</persName> agenda anticipated discussion
                            on Laos and Cambodia as follows:</p>
                        <p>“5. Cross border operations between Laos and Cambodia. Although the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> raised this question this
                            afternoon, they were surprisingly mild. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>, however, was not present, and
                            he may suggest early action. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> having just made another turn-about, and
                            Souvanna being in one of his periodical states of jelly—this is not the
                            time to press against either of these countries. This is particularly
                            true if we have any hope of laying a political base for direct pressure
                            against the North. It is going to be difficult enough to lay such a base
                            without also having to face the screams of the rest of the world that we
                            are beating on two small and supposedly neutral countries.” (Ibid.,

                            great concern over recent serious deterioration in

                            likely suffer at tripartite meeting unless present schism healed.</p>
                        <p>As first step we consider it essential that there be improvement in

                                April 8, the Department instructed Rice to obtain from Souvanna an
                                indication of the results of his trip during Rice's courtesy call.
                                (Ibid., POL 7 LAOS)</note> Souvanna received me this morning and
                            listened with interest to accounts latest developments in talks on
                            Vientiane security situation (Vientiane's reftel). He said that this was
                            good news because at his departure he had been greatly concerned over
                            this problem and the hostile attitude shown by General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>. He then gave us following
                            comments on his conversations in Hanoi and Peiping:</p>
                        <p>1. He had received assurances that Peiping would not link the Laotian
                            question with that of Vietnam, and this he hoped had cleared the way for
                            a settlement. The North Vietnamese, for their part, had always sought to
                            link the two questions. When asked whether anything had been said in
                            Hanoi on this topic, he said there had not been, but he expected Peiping
                            to use its influence upon Hanoi. The Viet Minh in Laos had always
                            insisted on keeping the frontier zones under their control. But
                            Peiping's position that the two questions should be kept separate,
                            assuming it was sincerely held, meant that Peiping recognized that
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>'s authority extended to all
                            Laos. For us this position was excellent, he said; now all depended on
                            the meeting of the three factions scheduled for April 17.</p>
                        <p>2. A key question now was the position of General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, and whether he would oppose the
                            application of the Nov. 27, 1962 agreement providing for a unified
                            administration, the formation of a mixed police force assuring security
                            at Vientiane, and the establishment of a 30,000 man national army
                            composed of 10,000 man-contingents from each party. Phoumi would have a
                            problem, he recognized, in demobilizing 50–60,000 men, but he believed a
                            solution could be found. If the agreement could be implemented it would
                            mean, he repeated, that the authority of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would extend to all Laos including the corridor.</p>
                        <p>3. When I asked him how the PL would be likely to react, he said they
                            would have to agree to free circulation throughout Laos. In Hanoi where
                            he had talked with Pham Van Dong and Gen. <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName> for two-half <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0073"/>hours and later with Pham alone for four hours, he had made them
                            understand that they should use their influence on the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> to make them accept this. He had told
                            them this effort was his last; if he left, it would mean civil war, and
                            North Vietnam would be affected. They had asked him to remain and had
                            said they would do everything they could to help him resolve the Laotian
                            question. If Hanoi keeps promise, Souvanna said the position of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> at the April 17 meeting will
                            change and will become less stiff.</p>
                        <p>4. Turning again to the question of <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, Souvanna said that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must press him very strongly not merely to see his own
                            personal interests but those of his country and of peace in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. Since Sarit's death,<note n="4" xml:id="d20fn4">Sarit Thanarat, former Prime Minister of Thailand,
                                died on December 8, 1963.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> had been seeking as an
                            alternative support from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and Taiwan;
                            it was important that neither make him any promises. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, without his permission, had met
                            twice with General <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>, and
                            once in Bangkok Mar 17 with ChiNat Chief of Staff Peng Meng-chi. This
                            latter intelligence he had only learned of while in Peiping and from the
                            Chinese Communists. All this was very dangerous. (It occurred to me at
                            this point that Souvanna's bargaining position vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> might have been improved by those
                            activities of <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s, but
                            decided it would be better to leave this point for Amb <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> to make if it has validity and is
                            useful.)</p>
                        <p>5. When I sought further comment on the chances of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> accepting this arrangement, Souvanna said
                            he thought that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> wished to return
                            to the government, but because of the poor security in the city they had
                            been unable to remain. He also had authorized two neutralist ministers
                            to leave, and even his own personal security had been menaced. (He
                            seemed at this point to imply that if the security issue could be
                            settled, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> cooperation could be
                            obtained.)</p>
                        <p>6. This concluded substantive part of our conversation, Souvanna passed
                            on copy of text of communique with North Vietnam, which we had not seen.
                            He mentioned that he also had given copy to Chinese who had not
                            heretofore seen text (being separately airpouched). In parting I
                            mentioned great esteem in which he was held by my superiors in
                            Washington and high importance they attached to success of his
                            efforts.</p>

                        <p>1. In view of concern in Saigon that the Communists may be creating in
                            Laos a capability for direct unit support to the Viet Cong (Para 7,
                            Reftel), and fact that this concern can not be definitely dispelled by
                            present all-source intelligence holdings, there is a requirement for
                            cross-border air and ground intelligence collection missions. Laotian
                            right-wing sources have repeatedly reported larger concentrations of
                            troops and heavier supply activity (including air drops) in southeastern
                            Laos than can be confirmed or are accepted. Our discounting of these
                            reports is not based on first hand information, however, and could be
                            dangerous. High-altitude photography has been of some assistance in this
                            problem but because of the heavily-forested terrain their product is not
                            conclusive. The photographs have shown truck activity on Route 12A but
                            give no indication of cargo or destination.</p>
                        <p>2. A Viet Cong hospital and rehabilitation center has been reported in
                            the Laos-Cambodia border area but never confirmed. It would be helpful
                            to know the exact size, status and location of this
                            facility—particularly whether it is in Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>3. It may also be that the value of logistic support to the Viet Cong via
                            Laos has been overestimated and that in fact the bulk of this support
                            arrives by sea or via Cambodia. Based on present intelligence holdings
                            we are not able to arrive at a sound judgement on this question. Ground
                            reconnaissance patrols into Laos would appear to be the best way to get
                            detailed information on the extent of Communist activity there.</p>

                        <p> LAOS </p>
                        <p>The Laotian summit meeting on April 18 failed because of a Pathet Lao
                            demand that the conservatives make on the spot decisions regarding the
                            neutralization and demilitarization of Luang Prabang, the royal capital.
                            In wake of this event, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> announced on April 18 that he would
                            submit his resignation to the King.</p>
                        <p>During the early morning hours of April 19, local time, forces of the
                            Laotian National Army under General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, Commander of the Fifth Military Region which
                            includes Vientiane, and General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>, Chief of the conservative security forces in
                            Vientiane (Directorate of National Coordination) arrested the
                            neutralists, including the Prime Minister, and seized power in the name
                            of the National Army Revolutionary Committee (<gloss target="#t_NARC1">NARC</gloss>). In a communique issued shortly after the take-over,
                            the <gloss target="#t_NARC1">NARC</gloss> announced that it had found it
                            necessary to stage a coup d'etat to bring about national reconciliation.
                            It listed General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> as
                            chief of the <gloss target="#t_NARC1">NARC</gloss>, General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> as deputy chief and most of the
                            other military leaders as functionaries or members.</p>
                        <p>As of 5 a.m. (EST) April 19, the situation in Laos appears calm. A curfew
                            has been imposed and martial law has been declared. A statement,
                            allegedly by <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, has
                            been broadcast containing his resignation and relinquishment of power to
                            the <gloss target="#t_NARC1">NARC</gloss>. According to a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> report, General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> was advised early of the coup and
                            telephoned his congratulations to General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>. There is at this time no firm information on the
                            place where <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> is
                            being held. General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s
                            position is unclear and he is not listed as a member of the <gloss target="#t_NARC1">NARC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We have issued a strong statement reaffirming our support of the

                        <p>1. Prior to the President's arrival there was a discussion of the traffic
                            from Laos and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGM1">Barbis</persName> gave a
                            short review of the 1958–1960 series of Lao coups. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> identified the basic question as
                            one of determining a U.S. position which would disassociate ourselves
                            from the coup but at the same time not encourage the Pathet Lao and
                            Vietnamese to move against the Lao Government. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> asked what pressures we have on the Right
                            Wing and it was agreed we had considerable power but that our experience
                            had shown it could not be exercised in the short term.</p>
                        <p>2. The President then entered. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> briefed him on the situation and the basic problem
                            of disassociating ourselves without inviting action by the Communists.
                            He pointed out the State Department release of Saturday night deploring
                            the coup<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">See <ref target="#d22fn2">footnote
                                    2, Document 22</ref>.</note> and commented that we were in the
                            process of making approaches to other governments involved in the Geneva
                            Agreements to reiterate our non-involvement.</p>
                        <p>3. The President suggested that Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> who is in
                            Saigon be sent to Vientiane for a first hand look prior to his return to
                            Washington. He commented that he agreed with the U.S. support of the
                            Geneva Agreements but that he would not do much urging of action until
                            we see the situation more clearly than we do now. He returned to this
                            point several times during the meeting, indicating some displeasure with
                            the final sentence of State's release.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">The
                                final sentence of the release reads: “We are therefore categorically
                                opposed to any seizure of power and are urging immediate release of
                                neutralists as a first step to restoring the situation.”</note> He
                            stated he agreed that some word should be <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0077"/>gotten to Hanoi to hold them back from any idea of
                            moving in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            mentioned the possibility of some involvement of General <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> in the course of the <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> discussions about two weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>4. The President also agreed that we take the position with the other
                            Geneva powers that the cease-fire in Laos must be maintained and he
                            agreed that other governments be approached, especially the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, along these lines. He then asked that
                            recommendations for action be prepared by Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            in conjunction with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> and that meanwhile no other public statements be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>5. The President then departed and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> requested that the group remain for a general
                            review of the problem. It was pointed out that the balance of forces in
                            Laos generally favored the Pathet Lao with their Viet Minh cadres but
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> stated that he did
                            not expect any immediate full scale move which would involve Viet Minh
                            units. The <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> was believed by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> not to be much better
                            than it ever was, despite some reports of improvement we have heard in
                            the past. Kong Le offers more a political than a military force. The
                            chances of substantial support to the non-communists from Thailand or
                            South Vietnam were not considered great. Among the actions considered
                            were the possibility of reinforcing the Thais with a U.S. unit (which it
                            was agreed was complicated as the Thais would exact some assurances on
                            our policy in Laos), and the movement of U.S. naval units off North
                            Vietnam. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>
                            suggested that we tie our actions in Laos to the public discussion of
                            possible action against North Vietnam, which he believed has a useful
                            effect on the Communists.</p>
                        <p>6. There was then some discussion as to whether it would be possible to
                            restore a neutral government in Laos or whether it would develop into a
                            formal partition. It was agreed that the assistance of the King should
                            be sought but that no great hopes could rest upon him, and that one of
                            the critical figures was Kong Le.</p>
                        <p>7. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> summarized the actions required as
                            determining:</p>
                        <p>a. Whether and how we reestablish the neutral solution (i.e. “put Humpty
                            Dumpty together again”). In this context the position of Kong Le is
                            important.</p>
                        <p>b. The degree of South Vietnamese involvement, encouragement or potential
                            in the Lao situation.</p>
                        <p>c. How to maintain the cease-fire, getting word to the Communist side and
                            especially Hanoi to do so.</p>
                        <p>d. The reactions of our Ambassadors in various countries to the prospect
                            of a new Geneva meeting on Laos and whether this would involve Cambodia,
                            Vietnam, etc.</p>
                        <p>e. The effects of a formal North-South partition on the situation in
                            Vietnam, i.e. whether this would substantially improve the North
                            Vietnamese capabilities of supporting the Viet Cong.</p>
                        <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0078"/>
                        <p>f. Alerting various intelligence activities to any indications of early
                            action by the Communist side. In this context the Department of Defense
                            will ensure a full coverage by high level reconnaissance on Southeast
                            Laos and <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> will be altered to follow
                            the traffic analysis in Laos and Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>8. After the meeting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>
                            and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> discussed
                            the problem informally, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> indicating it might be necessary soon to move to
                            Geneva from a real position of strength with the U.S. fleet pointing at
                            Hai Phong. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            indicated he agreed with this position.</p>

                            Met this morning with President, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> and

                            activities. General agreement was in favor of efforts to try to restore
                            tripartite neutral arrangement although President himself felt that we
                            did not know enough to reach definitive conclusions. President in fact
                            was a little unhappy that we had moved so quickly in issuing public
                            statement in the middle of night categorically disavowing coup.<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">See <ref target="#d22fn2">footnote 2, Document

                                would have been better if the President had been called and given a
                                chance to offer an instruction on the coup. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed. (Johnson Library,

                            move against <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> or neutralist

                        <p>President was anxious to get clearest reading possible of situation and
                            was therefore insistent that Bill Bundy should pay brief visit to
                            Vientiane before returning in order to bring home a first-hand
                                report.<note n="4" xml:id="d24fn4">In White House telegram CAP 64118

                                recommendations. The telegram continued that the “confused situation
                                and multiplicity of varying reports make President eager for

                            views soonest on desirability unadvertised movement of US forces, such
                            as naval units toward North Viet-Nam, in order to deter and discourage
                            North Viet-Nam or other communist elements from military exploitation of
                            current confused situation in Laos. Such movements would obviously have
                            to be carried out in such manner that coup government in Vientiane does

                        <p>877. For the Ambassador. We fully support and commend excellent way you
                            and your staff handling this difficult complex situation.</p>
                        <p>Our much preferred course of action is, of course, to put Government of
                            National Union back together again and we look forward to your
                            recommendations on ways and means for achieving this cardinal objective.
                            If, unfortunately, it appears that present political situation is likely
                            to be irreversible, or if other courses seem to be necessary to pursue,
                            we will also need your thoughts on alternatives.</p>
                        <p>In line with your recent think-piece (Embtel 1134)<note n="2" xml:id="d26fn2">In telegram 1134 from Vientiane, April 17, the
                                Embassy proposed charting a revolutionary process of gradual
                                internal regeneration even while the country remained divided. The
                                eventual goal would be a new, more progressive leadership drawn from
                                the younger members of the conservative-neutralist ranks. (Ibid.,
                                POL 27–14 LAOS)</note> you may perceive ways to utilize ferment of
                            evolving events to move towards a stronger government under Souvanna,
                            notably introducing more integrity and common sense into the right wing
                            and more vigor and leadership into the center.</p>

                            preparing for scheduled 4:00 P.M. press conference. I told them U.S.
                            could not accept or support action taken this morning, that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> supports Government of National Union
                            under framework of Geneva Accords. I showed them Department press

                            could be done. I pressed for release of detained neutralists. Generals
                            stated Souvanna and Minister <gloss target="#t_PTT1">PTT</gloss> Tiao
                            Sisoumang “being released” and Min Interior Pheng Phongsavan missing,

                        <p>Would it make sense for us and others to urge the King to gather all the
                            notables and tell them the time has come to put an end to so much
                            nonsense, to send away all foreigners meddling in their affairs and to
                            support a Government of National Union designated by him to run the
                            country.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>: I asked whether
                            Revolutionary Committee considered itself a government and they replied
                            in negative. They indicated they did not know what action to take re
                            Government of National Union, which I said is only Government we
                            recognize, since they had already announced it dissolved.</p>
                        <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>They asked for advice and I said they must reinstate Government National
                            Union. I added suggestion on strictly personal basis, they might explain
                            to public they had acted because of concern over security to which
                            Souvanna's declared intention to resign had given rise. Now security
                            restored, Government National Union reinstated, and question of
                            Souvanna's resignation will be handled in constitutional manner.
                            Generals took this in, indicated only that they would consider some
                            revision their intended statement and would be in touch with
                            Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>I repeated before leaving that we could not accept or acknowledge group
                            on basis of this morning's action. If Souvanna resigned and King
                            accepted, we would face new situation in which I did not know U.S.
                            position but as of now we recognize only Souvanna as PriMin of coalition
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Throughout conversation, both <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> gave impression of being badly frightened little
                            boys who now realize they have climbed too far out on limb and uncertain
                            how to proceed or whether to draw back.</p>
                        <p>After my meeting with them Generals met press and distributed list of
                            executive committee of Revolutionary Committee (by septel).<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">Not found.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> subsequently issued
                            statement that army, which has worked twenty years for independence,
                            could not be instrument of coalition government which by its
                            deficiencies and divisions had come to face stalemate and in this
                            situation has risen to overthrow the (coalition), reestablish peace,
                            improve the economic situation, bring happiness and democracy to the
                            population. We proclaim our fidelity to the King and the population and
                            we hope the population supports us.</p>
                        <p>I have now just come from seeing <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> to whom I made familiar arguments. He professed
                            his disgust with infantile action of <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> (whom he primarily blames) and agreed to urge him
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> to restore
                            situation to status quo ante. When I left him those two were waiting to
                            see <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and I hope he will live
                            up to his promise and with good effect. He also promised try to reach
                            Souvanna and explain his non-involvement in coup. Whatever
                            responsibility Phoumi may bear for coup, he now seems to have decided to
                            disassociate himself from Revolutionary Committee entirely.</p>
                        <p>All further circulation Vientiane now ruled out by curfew. Tomorrow
                            morning I will try see Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui
                                Sananikone</persName>, believing latter bears considerable
                            responsibility for <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> actions. Will also try
                            see Soviet Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>Unless Revolutionary Committee has reinstated Government of National
                            Union tomorrow morning I am ordering Americans actually <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0083"/>working in Lao Govt as advisers, etc. to
                            remain absent from work and will seek avoid any action which appears to
                            recognize or in any sense support Revolutionary Committee. This is in
                            line with course of action agreed among 4 Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: International reaction may become crucial to General's
                            attitude. Do not hesitate to press United Kingdom, French, Australian
                            Ambassadors to put aside niceties and make their position clear direct
                            to Revolutionary Committee. Such contact cannot possibly confer
                            recognition which is clearly a matter of intention.</p>

                            Unclear, however, who are foreigners. Designation of new Government of
                            National Union to replace present one of pre-coup situation would of
                            course raise numerous very tricky questions involving Pathet Lao
                            concept, etc. Revolutionary Committee which currently in charge
                            Vientiane would also have to agree.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I mean by foreigners the Viet Minh and assume the Government
                            of National Union would start with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna

                        <p>I believe it important that <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> be
                            advised against expressing support for action of coup group,
                            particularly in dealing with <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> General

                            Thai Govt be cautioned against giving evidence of support for action
                            against constituted Govt—action from which some of leaders at least now
                            show some signs of wishing to retreat.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: This has already been done by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> has shown full understanding
                            and has agreed not to act without full consultation with US.</p>

                            well to move naval units into Tourane area approaching from north where
                            their pressure would become known to other side. One of my
                            recommendations upon return will be that we consider very seriously
                            maintenance of a naval presence in either Tourane or Cam Ranh Bay areas
                            until pacification completed. Cover story for present move would be
                            exercise to examine and test ability coastal areas South Viet-nam to
                            receive and accommodate external naval forces. Believe <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> would be entirely cooperative
                            but story should be checked with him before issuance. Do not believe in

                            forcefully in Vientiane that coup leaders will misinterpret. Naval
                            presence might be encouraging to <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna

                        <p>Would not recommend movement of troops to Thailand for present (though
                            units should be alerted). Part of reason is that it not wholly clear

                            first-rate reporting this outstanding team, but while situation still
                            fluid and awaiting return Souvanna and party from Luang Prabang may be
                            useful outline possibilities and attempt initial analysis their
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>Following appear to be possible outcomes:</p>
                        <p>1. Souvanna (who contrary to our fears does as of now seem willing to
                            resume responsibility) obtains agreement of King and <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, plus <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> acquiescense, to restoration of tripartite
                            Government of National Union with balanced representation. Might be some
                            changes of portfolio, but essential structure preserved.</p>
                        <p>2. Souvanna agrees to head neutralist-rightist government, with top
                            portfolios to these two groups and either no <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> participation or token offer to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> which in circumstances would almost certainly be
                            refused.</p>
                        <p>3. Rightist-dominated government (perhaps under <gloss target="#t_DNC1">DNC</gloss> veto) but with some neutralist participation altho not
                            Souvanna. For example, <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>
                            might support under a deal for his keeping local control. Clear judgment
                            here is that <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> will not
                            revert to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> under any foreseeable
                            outcome.</p>
                        <p>4. Agreement tonight on solution 1, but then this upset by hotheads, Siho
                            and Tong Lit, so that result is clearly rightist government. This much
                            the same as 3, but likely to be more extreme and less legal in
                            appearance.</p>
                        <p>Following is analysis:</p>
                        <p>A. Likelihood. Outcome 1 still seems possible and almost in Lao pattern;
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> may well have had plans
                            to move toward outcome, but crudeness this coup and quick US opposition
                            may cauterize present pressures for that and even stay his hand for some
                            time. Outcome 2 contrary to all previous Souvanna statements about
                            staying only so long as he can keep all three factions in harness of
                            sorts; however, Pathet Lao <pb n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0086"/>obdurate position at meeting of three (which Denson reports outraged
                            Souvanna, especially when Soviet Amb tried to defend <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> Saturday afternoon) might conceivably
                            have persuaded him PL now hopeless. Outcome 3 is what <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> wants and <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> yesterday ambiguous enough to
                            suggest he might play. Outcome 4 unpredictable, but <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> will have lost a lot of face and
                            his personal forces plus Tong Lit position in Vientiane still major
                            factors. (<gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> reports forces surrounding
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> house today, and these
                            presumed under Tong Lit.)</p>
                        <p>B. Desirability for US interests. In order of numbers, clearly only
                            outcome 1 keeps Geneva Accords intact and leaves risks <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            action at past levels; as all along, it is only buying time in one
                            sense, but that alone of great value unless and until we have concerted
                            plan for stronger action throughout area.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, both outcomes 2 and 3 confront us with rupture with <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and sharply increased chance they and
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> moving on military front perhaps
                            initially at such places as Saravane and Attopeu, perhaps <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>, although probably not Thakhek till
                            later. Thai pressure then very strong and our own interests would
                            probably require military counter-action. Difference between 2 and 3 is
                            that presence of Souvanna would give much better appearance and reduce
                            adverse major power reaction especially French. However, Soviets would
                            oppose and I guess withdraw from picture tho probably not helping <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CC1">CC</gloss>
                            except by words.</p>
                        <p>Outcome 4 seems absolutely sure to trigger sharpest <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            military action, in worst possible political circumstances for US. Also
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> itself might be split in such
                            case, with <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> downgraded in
                            favor of hotheads, who have limited capacity and ability to work
                            together.</p>
                        <p>In sum, although a partition of Laos has never been off the cards and
                            there many advantages in US moving into southern and eventually eastern
                            Laos, alone or with Thai, wider disadvantages of doing so under outcome
                            2 not minor and under 3 and 4 very great indeed. As in 1961, we just
                            don't have much to work with, and military action expensive with no
                            clear end; however, advantages for South Vietnam struggle now clearer
                            and perhaps more persuasive to US public.</p>
                        <p>Since even outcome 2 breaches spirit Geneva Accords, we must reckon in
                            all three with inhibiting effect of call for reconvened conference, and
                            bad effect of any “Geneva conference,” even on Laos, on Vietnamese
                            morale.</p>
                        <p>C. US action. As we are now doing, we should bend all our efforts to get
                            outcome 1. Since there is shadow of doubt on Thai role and attitudes
                            (Ambassador here refusing, as Dean of Corps, to lead group in calling on
                            Souvanna), assume Embassy Bangkok is making this position clear there.
                            If useful I could see Thanat tomorrow afternoon before leaving with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> for home.</p>
                        <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0087"/>
                        <p>Assume we also stressing <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> responsibility
                            for <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> summit breakup to Soviets. (Sov
                            Ambassador has just told <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> he
                            recognizes <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> were “a bit hard”.)</p>
                        <p>If tonight or later developments make clear outcome 1 out believe we
                            could recognize outcome 2 promptly. If outcome is 3 or 4, believe we
                            should at least withhold recognition for short time but avoid freezing
                            into position of disapproval we might soon have to eat. Try to let
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> make first military moves, but be ready to react very
                            quickly and to decide early just how far we are prepared to go. My own
                            feeling is that we must then act against Laos corridor, justifying on
                            basis <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> have been violating all along. But it is worth some
                            military disadvantage to get political posture in as good shape as
                            possible, stressing that we had no part in events and above all that
                            crisis really brought on by <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> not only
                            now but over long period. Suggest a quick white paper on this be drafted
                            in case of need. A more minor point would be to stress that my mission
                            here was to encourage Souvanna to stay on, if persuasion needed, which
                            is explanation <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> and I have
                            already given three Ambassadors.</p>
                        <p>As to military action, believe we should go no further than Seventh Fleet
                            movements for now, but do all possible to improve reaction time for
                            forces into Thailand. In terms of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> deterrence, this is the big card

                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> was sent to
                                Vientiane at President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s instruction; see <ref target="#d24fn4">footnote 4, Document 24</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Pro</p>
                        <p>1. Because of his rank and his Washington standing, he is a symbol of our
                            concern in Laos and provides that much reinforcement to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0088"/>
                        <p>2. If he comes back promptly and then things come apart, it may look as
                            if he had failed to make an adequate effort.</p>
                        <p>3. If he should stay two or three days and the coalition is put together
                            again, it would be a real plus for a Presidential emissary, and would
                            give some advantage to us on that score.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Con</p>
                        <p>1. As a practical matter, both Bill Bundy and everyone else agree that
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> is first class and can
                            be counted on to play every card with skill and energy in Vientiane.
                            Indeed the whole Laotian country team has performed outstandingly in
                            this crisis.</p>
                        <p>2. The high probability is that negotiations for a reconstituted
                            government with or without Souvanna will go on for many days, no matter
                            what pressures we bring. The clocks in Laos run on their own time.</p>
                        <p>3. There are very important operational responsibilities here which have
                            been waiting <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>'s return, and
                            we lose effectiveness on some issues in Vietnam and elsewhere as long as
                            he is away.</p>
                        <p>4. If the current negotiations should break down and we should need to
                            move in a new direction in Laos, we could always get Bill Bundy back out
                            there in 24 hours, and if he came fresh from up-to-date deliberations in
                            Washington he would be in a stronger position to act for us in such a
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p>On balance, my own judgment is that we should bring Bill back, and I
                            believe this is also the view of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Briefly, the situation seems to be that Generals <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> have pressed <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> into resigning and forming a new
                            government without the Pathet Lao.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> is trying to
                            persuade the generals that this action will not be accepted by the
                            Pathet Lao and will result in a breakdown of the Geneva Accords. We do
                            not yet know whether he will be successful.</p>
                        <p> Bill Bundy is standing by in Bangkok, but will be taking off within the
                            next three hours unless we tell him to stay. I believe that the
                            consensus in State is that he should return in order to report to you as
                            soon as possible and to assume direction of the operations in

                            reaching for some easy way out and one of them is to get the Russians to

                            Pathet Lao representation. This would be utterly unrealistic. Russians
                            would never agree. He wants Tommy [<persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>] to see <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>. If this comes up, it must be knocked out.

                            and ask them to accept in advance. Wouldn't do it and haven't got

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The coup mounted by rightist elements in Vientiane on 19 April appears
                            to have been only marginally successful. Denied the support of key
                            rightist elements, weakened internally by the shifting allegiance of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and opposed by
                            the Western powers, the coup group's authority appears limited to
                            Vientiane and its environs. On one count, however, it must be scored a
                            success: the current coalition seems finished and it is problematical
                            whether it will be possible to preserve the tripartite coalition
                            formula.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conditions Leading to Rightist Opposition to the
                            Coalition</p>
                        <p>2. The conditions which prompted the coup attempt have been present and
                            festering since the coalition was formed in June 1962. From the outset,
                            leaders of the conservative faction doubted Souvanna's ability to resist
                            Pathet Lao encroachments. Rightist fears were multiplied when Communist
                            China stepped up its road-building activities in northern Laos in late
                            1962. About that time, it was also becoming clear that left-wing
                            neutralist Quinim Pholsena was exerting increasing influence over
                            national policies through his position as foreign minister. More
                            recently, Souvanna's efforts to secure neutralization of Luang Prabang
                            without exacting commensurate concessions from the Pathet Lao sharpened
                            rightist doubts regarding his value as national leader.</p>
                        <p>3. Other, less obvious, grounds existed for rightist opposition to
                            Souvanna's coalition experiment. Under Souvanna's plan for military
                            demobilization rightist forces would be reduced from approximately
                            60,000 to 10,000 men. Aside from impairing rightist ability to resist
                            Communist subversion and reducing both the numbers and the influence of
                            the military, this reduction would erode individual power positions,
                            such as Boun Oum's “fief” in south Laos under the command of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk Somly</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s power base in General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>'s 6–8,000 man security force.</p>
                        <p>4. In short, the coalition formula has been viewed by the rightists as
                            opening the way to Communist encroachment within the government and as a
                            vehicle for changes which could adversely affect the interests of a
                            substantial portion of the right-wing elite.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Manifestations of Rightist Opposition</p>
                        <p>5. Rightist opposition to the coalition concept was evident even before
                            the signing of the Geneva accords of July 1962. It took US economic
                            sanctions and the military disaster of Nam Tha in May 1962 to bring
                            around the rightists to support of the tripartite formula.</p>
                        <p>6. Since the formation of the Souvanna government, rightist opposition
                            has taken the form of resistance to measures designed to implement
                            national reunification. In most cases, rightist opposition has had more
                            than adequate justification in the face of continued Communist military
                            and diplomatic maneuvering.</p>
                        <p>7. Basic rightist opposition has also been reflected in the coup rumors
                            which have been heard in Vientiane from time to time. Right-wing
                            elements—generally those with power bases in the Vientiane area, i.e.,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>—repeatedly have been cited as
                            preparing to topple the government. Many of these rumors probably were
                            trial balloons launched almost wistfully to test US reaction. The
                            rightists continued to hope that US policy toward Souvanna would change
                            and that the US—while not explicitly promising support—would not oppose
                            his ouster.</p>
                        <p>8. Most rightist leaders, subjected to repeated US rebuffs to such
                            probes, generally took the line that they would not act without US
                            acquiescence.</p>
                        <p>9. More recently, General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            reportedly had been planning to take control of the government upon
                            Souvanna's expected resignation. However, reporting indicated that he
                            intended to hold off any move until Souvanna had actually submitted his
                            resignation. Souvanna, following the failure of tripartite talks in the
                            Plaine des Jarres on 17–18 April, had come close to the end of his rope.
                            He indicated to Western diplomats and the press his intent to submit his
                            resignation to King Savang on 20 April. Western powers began to mount
                            intensive efforts to dissuade Souvanna or—failing that—to convince the
                            King to decline the resignation. In view of Souvanna's known proclivity
                            to issue—and then back off from—resignation threats, there appeared to
                            remain a chance that he could be led to reconsider his decision.</p>
                        <p>10. At this point, General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>,
                            jumping the gun, mounted his coup early on the morning of 19 April. With
                            the apparently reluctant support of <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, the roundup of the neutralists was a simple
                            matter and Vientiane quickly was under <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>'s control. Siho's reasons for such precipitate
                            actions are obscure. He is inordinately ambitious, and he may have
                            thought he saw a way of emerging from <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s shadow and obtaining recognition in his own
                            right. It is also possible that the politically unsophisticated
                                <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> saw in the recent coups
                            in South Vietnam the key to US recognition and support for a more
                            vigorous opposition to Communism. That something of this was in
                                <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>'s mind is suggested by
                                <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0093"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>'s reported view that his coup
                            was “similar” to General <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>'s in South Vietnam, and had the purpose of stepping up
                            “the war against the Pathet Lao and Communist enemies.”</p>

                        <p>After brief discussion on another subject the Secretary, who had asked
                            the Ambassador to call, raised the matter of Laos. He said that he had
                            received within the last ten minutes a telegram reporting on current
                            developments in that country and in particular interviews of several
                            chiefs of mission with the King and later <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> (Vientiane's 1168, April 22).<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">See <ref target="#d36fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    36</ref>.</note> He said that the United States continues to
                            support the Government of National Union and considers it necessary to
                            restore that government to full authority. He added that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> is ready to stay on as
                            Prime Minister and that General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> is the primary obstacle to restoration of the
                            previous situation in Vientiane. He added that the Laotian armed forces
                            elsewhere are not participating in the current revolt and that the King
                            has asked General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> to take
                            care of the <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> difficulty. After
                            mentioning that the United States Ambassador to Laos is in close touch
                            with his Soviet counterpart, the Secretary emphasized that the United
                            States had nothing to do with the military coup but that it arose from
                            the recent breakdown of talks between the three factions in Laos, which
                            had been making good progress toward agreement <pb n="62" xml:id="pg_62" facs="0094"/>in principle when <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said that he must consult with his supporters and
                            Souphanouvong insisted on immediate agreement and broke up the meeting
                            on this issue. <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                            felt that Souphanouvong had been very unreasonable. As a result of the
                            breakdown of the talks <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> became discouraged and wanted to resign as Prime
                            Minister. The United States attempted to discourage him from this
                            course. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> came
                            to Saigon to discuss the subject with the Secretary, the coup broke out
                            and the Secretary immediately sent <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> back to tell <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> that the United States supports the Geneva
                            Accords and the tripartite government formed under them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that he wished to emphasize how important it is
                            that the Pathet Lao should not act now in any way to damage the Geneva
                            Accords. He requested the Ambassador to ask his government to do
                            everything possible to get the Pathet Lao to support the Geneva Accords.
                            He said it is vital to keep the 1962 Geneva Agreements effective. We
                            (the United States) have been discouraged by the Pathet Lao's actions
                            against the Geneva Accords, in particular their introduction of North
                            Vietnamese forces into Laos and their allowing the North Vietnamese to
                            use Laotian territory as a corridor into South Vietnam. The Secretary
                            emphasized again that both the United States and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should do everything possible to
                            restore the Geneva Agreements of 1962 and said that if all of us worked
                            toward this objective, there seemed a reasonable chance that we could
                            attain it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to an Izvestiya commentary (see Moscow
                            telegram 3225 of April 21<note n="3" xml:id="d34fn3">The commentary
                                argued that Lao neutrality was dependent on the end of the war in
                                South Vietnam. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 23–9
                                LAOS)</note>) which links the United States to the Vientiane coup.
                            He said that he hoped the Soviet Government would not continue to follow
                            that line, for the United States is sincerely trying to support the
                            Geneva Accords.<note n="4" xml:id="d34fn4">See <ref target="#d10">Document 10</ref>.</note> He added that the recent meeting of
                            the Ambassadors with the King had confirmed that the latter, as well as
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, is in
                            agreement with this United States position, that there may be a meeting
                            in Luang Prabang with all three factions of the Government of National
                            Union present, and that if <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            succeeds in handling <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>, it
                            should be possible to restore the previous situation in Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then turned to the broader subject of Southeast Asia as a
                            whole, mentioning that he wished to make a comment which he had not had
                            in mind when the Ambassador came in. He said that the United States is
                            not looking for military positions in Southeast Asia. If Hanoi and
                            Peiping would leave this area alone, the United States would not have
                            troops there. The United States is concerned about Hanoi and Peiping's
                            actions and intentions and wishes to protect the Southeast Asian
                            countries. <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0095"/>A very unpleasant
                            situation could develop if Hanoi and Peiping continued to push. The
                            Soviet Government as well as the United States should try to keep the
                            situation under control.<note n="5" xml:id="d34fn5">On May 5 <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, acting under
                                instructions, made an oral statement to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> responding to this discussion. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> noted the presence of U.S.
                                military personnel in Laos and the activities of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and Air America. He pointed out
                                that the organizers of the coup were those forces in Laos which the
                                United States supported. Notwithstanding U.S. assurances, Vientiane
                                was not safe for <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                    Phouma</persName> and many neutralist ministers, nor was
                                Vientiane in control of the Government of National Union. Should the
                                Neo Lao Hat Xat be forced from the Government and the civil war
                                resumed, <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated that
                                “it is difficult to imagine the external forces to remain
                                indifferent to the situation.” (Memorandum of conversation, May 5;

                        </p>
                        <p>After discussion of another subject the conversation turned again to
                            Laos. The Secretary noted that Izvestiya's commentary had said that “all
                            sources” agree that the tripartite talks broke down over <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s refusal to agree to neutralize
                            Luang Prabang. This was not the United States Government's
                            understanding. We understood rather that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> felt <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> had been
                            unreasonable. The Secretary also noted with amusement that Izvestiya's
                            commentary had quoted former Vice President Nixon and pointed out that

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the

                            Laos a serious one; that it had asked the United Kingdom to make a joint
                            appeal to restore the situation; that the Soviet Government supports the
                            Geneva Accords and therefore <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>; that his only information on current developments
                            in Laos came from the April 21 TASS statement; that he understood
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> was responsible for the
                            breakdown of the tripartite talks, noting that <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> seemed freer in action since the
                            coup than <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>; that
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has been doing its best to
                            support the tripartite coalition government and the Geneva Accords; and
                            that he did not need to repeat but could confirm that the Soviet
                            Government's view on the Laotian situation as set forth in “our” note of
                            March 31 [sic, but probably the Ambassador's note of March 25].<note n="6" xml:id="d34fn6">Brackets in the source text.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>With regard to Southeast Asia as a whole, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that his government
                            disapproved United States activity in general in this area. The Soviet
                            Government believed it better to let people alone to make their own
                            decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that South Vietnam should be free from the
                            pressure of the North Vietnamese men and weapons. There followed an
                            exchange on the situation in South Vietnam and North Vietnam's
                            responsibility for it. The Secretary and the Ambassador disagreed on the
                            facts and on their interpretation. The Ambassador emphasized that the
                            Viet Cong, like all guerrillas, could not succeed without popular
                            support, <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0096"/>while the Secretary
                            emphasized the North Vietnam role in the fighting.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador concluded that he was sure both he and the Secretary
                            understood each other's positions in this matter.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> and the country team are doing an excellent job.
                            The Ambassador is cool and has good judgment. As of this morning, the
                            chances looked pretty good that the former coalition will continue in
                            power. The King may be successful in holding together the coalition
                            government within the general Geneva framework. <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, who last week was very
                            discouraged and prepared to resign, is now ready to continue as Prime
                            Minister. Possibly the effect of his having been under arrest for two
                            days has changed his view about continuing as Prime Minister. The danger
                            in Laos is that right-wing hotheads who promoted the military revolution
                            and who now have military <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0097"/>control
                            of Vientiane may refuse to accept the compromise and break out despite
                            the opposition of <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and other
                            senior officers. <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> is a real
                            thug and very bad news. <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>
                            is a reasonably intelligent officer. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> has been reasonable and denies that he took any
                            part in the recent coup. He promised to try to get back to the situation
                            where they were before the right-wing officers overthrew the coalition.
                            A rightist push may, however, come later. Our short-term problem is to
                            keep the hotheads from preventing the restored coalition government
                            regaining power. We are considering a cable to our Ambassador
                            authorizing him to tell the right-wing hotheads that the U.S. will not
                            support their forces and will continue U.S. assistance to the other
                            military forces. We must always remember that it was the Pathet Lao who
                            were responsible for breaking up the conference at the Plaine des Jarres
                            and preventing the coalition from working. The Pathet Lao created the
                            situation which led to the right-wing revolt.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he had warned
                            Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> of the
                            importance we place on keeping the Pathet Lao from taking advantage of
                            the current chaotic situation in Laos.<note n="4" xml:id="d35fn4">See

                                these telegrams, April 21 and 22, the Embassy reported on efforts to
                                restore legal government in Vientiane and raised the possibility of
                                gradual sanctions against the coup leaders if they refused to agree

                            measures or sanctions. However, in event Revolutionary Committee
                            continues to put pressure on King and perhaps <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, whether or not King has announced formal action,
                            we authorize you to carry out limited sanctions and measures enumerated
                            your 1163 and 1169 except for public announcement of suspension of
                            military supplies.<note n="3" xml:id="d36fn3">Those sanctions were: a
                                gradual but visible withdrawal of dependents of Western diplomats
                                from Vientiane; a public announcement of suspension of U.S. military
                                shipments to forces under control of the Revolutionary Committee;
                                elimination of U.S. Mission contact with the Committee except for

                        </p>
                        <p>Instead of public announcement we believe military supply suspension
                            should be handled by your informing key individuals to this effect in
                            your discretion. You might wish to start with <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, making clear that shipments would continue, not
                            through Vientiane, to <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> units
                            remaining loyal to government recognized by King. (This need not mean
                            formal pledge to this effect, but could be left to your judgment of
                            where loyalties lie.) We leave it to you how to play <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and whether it would be
                            useful to say this to Siho or might drive him to violent reaction. You
                            could also inform <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, French, and
                            Australian reps urging no publicity.</p>
                        <p>We prefer this discriminate approach rather than press announcement
                            although we recognize word may get out. If so, believe you should avoid
                            comment at your end but report to us, and we could arrange low-key
                            confirmation here covering all aspects.</p>
                        <p>In suspending shipments of military supplies to Revolutionary Committee
                            forces, we assume that it is unlikely that the Pathet Lao will take
                            advantage of present confusion to initiate any military action since
                            reconstruction Geneva framework and government of national union
                            presumably in their interest also. If <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            do attack, we would, of course, have to reconsider our position. In any
                            event immediate impact of suspension will be primarily psychological and
                            will be slight in terms of military capability of units affected.</p>
                        <p>In order to ensure that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN will not
                            interpret suspension as invitation to move against non-Communists,
                            suggest Denson, Millet, or one of your other colleagues make it clear to

                            to withdraw Ambassadors as Millet has suggested and that best step would
                            be for you to move to Luang Prabang if you feel situation warrants it
                            and Souvanna remains there.</p>
                        <p>As to evacuation, we regard this more as a matter of your discretion for
                            safety US community than a sanction that would have weight with
                            Revolutionary Committee, and you are authorized to do this at any time
                            and in any degree you see fit. Septel gives funding authorizations.<note n="5" xml:id="d36fn5">Not found.</note> You can judge best balance

                        <p>We assume of course that you will first discuss these sanctions and other
                            measures with Souvanna and, if possible the King, so that they will
                            understand what we are doing and our rationale for it. It is essential
                            that we first have Souvanna's full understanding and support.</p>
                        <p>In addition to your proposed measures, we would like your views on
                            continuing suspension of <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss> sales.

                                reported that, encouraged by an April 23 public statement by Thai
                                Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman that his government would not act
                                jointly with other powers in imposing sanctions against the

                                government. If Souvanna made these concessions, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> suggested that the Pathet Lao

                                the Geneva Accords of 1962 had been breached. (Ibid.) The text of

                                concluded that the important thing was to concentrate on peace and
                                unity in Laos under the principles established by the Geneva
                                Agreements. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 15–1 LAOS)

                            legitimate basis for claiming Geneva settlement undermined, and you are
                            authorized to state that our support (military and economic) will not be
                            forthcoming if Group does so insist, and if it does not restore

                            necessarily be heeded or improper demands met, but it does mean that any
                            new composition must adhere to principles of June 1962 <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> agreement. (See Deptel 898 notal,

                                to Paris, repeated to Vientiane as 898, April 24, Alphand stated
                                that France could only support a Lao Government that represented all
                                three factions, but he agreed that the composition need not be
                                exactly the same as the old Souvanna government. The crucial point,
                                Alphand continued, was that the Pathet Lao agree to the formula for
                                the new government. (Ibid.)</note>

                                in theory, a strong conservative government in Laos was a chimera.
                                It would lead to an attack by the Pathet Lao, conservative defeat,
                                and Thailand and the United States having to decide to accept a

                        <p>This afternoon you asked for my advice regarding further action in
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>I believe we should accept Bill Bundy's recommendations and continue to
                            endeavor to force the junta leaders into support of a government <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0102"/>formed in accordance with the
                            Geneva Accords. To do otherwise would not only be a violation of an
                            agreement to which we are a party, but might very well lead to a
                            situation in which we face the loss of Laos to the Communists, or
                            alternatively the introduction of U.S. ground combat forces into that
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It seems quite clear the Pathet Lao will refuse to accept a government
                            which either excludes or substantially reduces the influence of their
                            representatives. If such a government is formed, almost certainly the
                            Pathet Lao would move against it militarily. We know they have the
                            military power to substantially expand the territory under their
                            control.</p>
                        <p>I see only two ways to prevent an expansion of the influence of the
                            Pathet Lao in Laos: either we must support the Geneva Accords or we must
                            be prepared to introduce U.S. forces into that country. Of the two I
                            much prefer the first. This requires that we apply pressure on the junta
                            leaders to support <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> as Premier and to accept the continued presence of

                            Communist military action be launched to take over this zone.
                            Fundamental premises to what follows are 1) we will not permit strategic
                            Mekong Valley to fall into Communist hands; 2) we continue to support

                            sharp shifts in policy. This time we <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0103"/>should not permit rash actions by irresponsible Lao to
                            dictate a change in basic US policy.</p>
                        <p>Should the revolutionary coup, in open defiance of US opposition, press
                            on even to point of getting King to recognize it the US should not waver
                            from our declared policy of support for the Geneva Accords. It follows
                            therefrom that we cannot recognize a group or even a so called govt
                            which has taken steps which in effect tear up the Geneva Accords. Our
                            effort, should this occur, would have to be directed at bringing the
                            revolutionary group to its knees by massive application of various
                            sanctions open to us. At same time, we should inform Soviets and ChiComs
                            (and maybe even North Vietnamese), also British and/or French of our
                            continued support of Geneva Accords and agreements underlying them,
                            resulting in our opposition to revolutionary coup, accompanied with
                            sober warning that this in no way means US is about to permit all of
                            Laos to fall under Communist domination. If Communists make any moves
                            threatening strategic Mekong Valley US will immediately take counter
                            measures of its own choosing to guarantee security that valley.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that Communists do not make any threatening move, actions which
                            we should take would be following:</p>
                        <p>1) We continue publicly support Geneva Accords, coalition Govt of
                            National Union and Souvanna as Prime Minister. (It will be important to
                            keep Souvanna from actually submitting resignation whether he actually
                            leaves Laos or not.)</p>
                        <p>2) We would announce complete suspension of American aid to Laos (USIP,
                                <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss>, project programs, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, etc.).</p>
                        <p>3) We would undertake immediate orderly evacuation all depend-ents (in
                            hope revolutionary group would be quickly brought to its knees and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program recommenced we would not
                            at first evacuate employees themselves).</p>
                        <p>4) We would try to continue supply <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong
                                Le</persName> forces and Meo and even any other dissident
                            non-Communist military groups with necessary subsistence and military
                            supplies by means of airlift from outside Laos (arrangements for airlift
                            into Laos from Thailand admittedly might be difficult to negotiate with
                            Thais if they determined to support coup group).</p>
                        <p>We believe application these measures would quickly cause economic chaos
                            as well as serious breakdown <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>
                            logistics thus forcing coup group to give up. At this point we would
                            hope coup leaders would be obliged either to flee Laos or acquiesce in
                            reconstitution of a coalition Govt of National Union under Souvanna.
                            Political consequences hard to predict, but this might mean in effect
                            the disappearance of extreme element of right wing and at least partial
                            amalgamation of right wing with neutralist center under Souvanna. While
                            economy and army might have been seriously weakened end result in terms
                            political configuration would be more in line with our ultimate goal
                            i.e. large grouping of all anti-Communist Lao. Since this merger of
                            right and center would be <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0104"/>under
                            aegis of Souvanna there would be no valid reason for objection to it
                            from such as Soviets, Poles, Indians, and French, since <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> would still be represented in govt.</p>
                        <p>On assumption that Communists do not heed our warning we would have to
                            resort various <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> measures to
                            introduce US and other troops to hold various key points along the
                            Mekong. Regardless of circumstances <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>
                            cannot be regarded as anything more than trip wire should Communists
                            make determined move with Vietnamese or Chinese troops. Even in these
                            circumstances we should not permit ourselves to become deflected from
                            our stated goal of reinvesting Souvanna and reestablishing entire Geneva
                            framework if only for our public picture.</p>
                        <p>The status of the coup group at this point has little importance. If our
                            intervention eventually led to a military stand off and partition of
                            Laos we would of course have to recognize govt in control this zone in
                            due course, but since we would in effect be in military control we could
                            probably shape things to our wish without much trouble.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The following notes are based on my conversation with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> and Mr. Nes of the
                            Saigon Embassy on Sunday morning, April 19, just before we received news
                            of the attempted coup. They thus reflect his judgment of the reaction in
                            Laos to possible scales of operation, as it related to a political
                            situation that assumed <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> back in control.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Southern Laos</hi>. The Ambassador reported that a
                            substantial expansion of Kha operations would get underway in early May
                            and <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0105"/>would build up out of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> bases, principally in the Saravan area,
                            so that there would be 15–20 teams, each with radio, operating in the
                            area from somewhat north of Saravan all the way down to the Cambodian
                            border.</p>
                        <p>I referred to General <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>'s
                            conversation with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            in which he had expressed particular concern over the southeast corner
                            of Laos.<note n="2" xml:id="d40fn2">See paragraph 8 of Secto 71 from

                            noted that General <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>
                            believes there are two Viet Minh battalions and a hospital installation
                            in the corner area.</p>
                        <p>(Parenthetically, we agreed at this point that there was inadequate
                            coordination between our people in Vientiane and our people in Saigon on
                            intelligence concerning eastern Laos, and that Vientiane should send
                            over a man at least once a month to be sure that Saigon had all the
                            information that Vientiane was getting through our various operations in
                            the area.)</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">General Standards for Operations in Laos</hi>. The
                            Ambassador said that we must consider carefully any action that would be
                            detected and cause a reaction on the part of Souvanna, in the first
                            place, and the Communists in the second. As to Souvanna, he said that
                            Souvanna is perfectly well aware that the Communists use eastern Laos
                            but that he thinks (or thought as of April 19) that he got some hopeful
                            indication in Peking that might enable him to work toward free
                            circulation in discussions with the three tendencies, and that he might
                            also now be able to get more help out of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Souvanna's basic feeling is that if there is really a
                            resumption of hostilities for any reason, it would be the end of Laos.
                            Therefore, he would be (again, as of April 19) in a very go-slow mood,
                            and in essence would be opposed to any action that might be detected,
                            i.e., in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s
                            judgment, any operation that was not: (a) small; (b) under Montagnard or
                            other cover; (c) kept away from population centers.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Mr. Nes said that it was the current <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> judgment that anything larger than a
                            small patrol would be detected and clobbered in eastern Laos, in view of
                            the substantial number of Viet Minh battalions operating in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>On the Communist side, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> thought that once the Communists learned of the
                            significant operations beyond the limits stated above, they could and
                            would move readily against Saravan (which was the key base for Kha
                            operations and which could be taken at any time) or Attopeu, which was
                            also important.</p>

                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> Attitude</hi>.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> thought that
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> basically would like to
                            get us into a fighting war, and that his contacts with <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> might be encouraging him to
                            think he could do this. He also noted that <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> has continuing GRC contacts via Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Soviet Leverage</hi>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> said that the Soviets were now
                            reasonable in Vientiane, but that they had only the most marginal
                            leverage and that their action had now became “very threadbare.” They
                            had no real weight any more with the Pathet Lao, and were often
                            reluctant to use what little they had for fear of cutting across the
                            Soviet effort to maintain some entree with Hanoi. The Ambassador
                            recalled that despite Pushkin's assurances to Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> two years ago, Khrushchev had
                            twice refused to reaffirm what Pushkin had said.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">“Hot Pursuit”</hi>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> said that, as it related to Laos,
                            this was really a fiction, since there had been no genuine case that he
                            was aware of. He also thought that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>, who might once have been agreeable to such
                            operations, was now opposed (as of April 19).</p>
                        <p>Referring to the outgoing State Department cable of April 7 (1630 to
                            Saigon and 836 to Vientiane),<note n="4" xml:id="d40fn4">In telegram
                                1630 to Saigon and also sent to Vientiane as 836, April 7, the

                                South Vietnamese cross border operations into Laos which it outlined
                                in the telegram. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 VIET
                                S)</note> Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> was
                            opposed to operations as large as those described in paragraph 2c of
                            that message (i.e., up to battalion size), and also leery of the
                            operations described in paragraph 2d and paragraph 2e (operations up to
                            battalion size to relieve friendly Lao forces on the border, and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> encadrements of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> units near the border.) He particularly thought that
                            identifiable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces would be
                            disruptive in Laos.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Reconnaissance Operations</hi>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> thought that lower level
                            reconnaissance should be conducted in Laos only down to an altitude of
                            10,000–15,000 feet. He thought these would have serious consequences if
                            an aircraft were lost, but did not think that unmarked aircraft, unless
                            lost, would cause a serious problem at the altitudes stated.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The main business of this meeting is to review intelligence information
                            indicating greatly increased use of Laos for infiltration from North to
                            South Vietnam. I think you may want to follow the following order of
                            discussions:</p>
                        <p>1. Briefing by <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> on this
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>2. Briefing by State (presumably Bill Bundy) on the political and
                            paramilitary situation in Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. Consideration of measures to get more hard evidence on North
                            Vietnamese use of the Laos corridor—State and Defense.</p>
                        <p>I doubt if you will wish to authorize specific actions today. It may be
                            better to hear the argument and let the meeting continue without you to
                            prepare a coordinated recommendation. I think such a recommendation can
                            be developed by State, Defense and the White House promptly, but it is
                            not in hand now.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">In a handwritten note at the

                        <p>This meeting is expected to cover two separate developments which have
                            come to light in recent days. Each item will be opened by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> briefing:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">1. Military Action Northeast and Southeast of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It is not yet clear whether this is a more or less routine action to
                            clear Meo units from an area where they have been able to harass Route 7
                            or whether there is also a push to extend <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> control westward along Route 7 at the expense of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> forces. The latter
                            would be a serious development and the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> should review various US courses of action which might
                            be followed if the situation develops in this way. For example,
                            movements by the 7th Fleet, introduction of ground forces into Thailand,
                            etc. Souvanna has already protested to the Co-Chairmen and the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and the Co-Chairmen's representatives
                            had planned to go to Khang Khay today.</p>
                        <p>Under this item, we should also be prepared to review for the President
                            the current political situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Evidence of Greatly Increased Use of Route
                            12-a from Southern NVN to Muong Phine Area near Tchepone.</p>
                        <p>Although it is not yet absolutely clear, there is a very strong
                            suggestion from photographic evidence that there has been a massive
                            increase in the use of this route for infiltration into <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. It is essential that we obtain further
                            information as promptly as possible, both in order to ascertain how much
                            is going in and out, so as to take counter-measures, and in order to
                            provide additional evidence for a possible further Jorden report in case
                            we decide on stronger measures at some point. The crucial issue is
                            whether the now much clearer need for better intelligence outweighs the
                            possible adverse effects of activity in Laos on a political situation
                            that seems likely to remain precarious at best for a considerable
                            period. On balance, my own conclusion is that the President should be
                            asked to authorize <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0109"/>the following
                            this afternoon, subject to more precise refinement by a working group
                            following the meeting:</p>
                        <p>(a) Use of agents in Laos. No political problem but equally not likely to
                            be really effective.</p>
                        <p>(b) Patrols. This is a tough one. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, prior to the coup, had expressed grave
                            reservations about units up to battalion size. At that time, Souvanna
                            was even opposed to “hot pursuit” (a fiction in any case), but the odds
                            are that the tough Peking statements of recent days have overcome any
                            illusion Souvanna may have had over having any better deal in Peking or
                            Hanoi. In any case, I believe we should abandon the idea of units as
                            large as a battalion but authorize patrols subject to the following
                            conditions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Units of 50–100 men.</p>
                        <p>(2) Not in <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> or other uniforms, but
                            plausibly deniable Montagnard or local groups.</p>
                        <p>(3) Aimed at intelligence, with any military action confined to
                            self-defense.</p>
                        <p>(4) Patrols to stay out of populated areas and not to proceed far to the
                            west. A flat mileage limit does not appear wise, but supply and timing
                            considerations alone would probably prevent patrols from going further
                            than 30–50 miles.</p>
                        <p>(5) Aerial resupply to be permitted, but by Vietnamese aircraft,
                            unmarked.</p>
                        <p>(6) No US advisers, at least at the outset.</p>
                        <p>(7) Operations to start in the northern area near Route 9, and to be
                            expanded thereafter to the south as results and indications warrant.</p>
                        <p>Except for the size of units, these are approximately the same conditions
                            proposed to <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> on April 7, to
                            which he demurred at that time.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">See <ref target="#d43fn4">Document 43 and footnote 4
                                thereto</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(c) Limited low-level reconnaissance to assess results. The photographic
                            people say that this can produce far greater sharpness but only if
                            undertaken at really low levels. It would help us ascertain what the
                            installations are and whether organized units may be starting to come
                            down. The authorization should not be open-ended, but should provide for
                            perhaps two trial missions to be conducted along Route 9 and Route 12-a
                            staying away from Tchepone and installations which have
                            anti-aircraft.</p>
                        <p>For the longer term the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> may wish to
                            consider various measures which would improve our posture, such as:</p>
                        <p>1. Expansion of Hardnose.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Operation Hardnose
                                was a program in which the United States organized, trained,
                                equipped, paid, and operated armed intelligence/reconnaissance teams
                                of various sizes behind Pathet Lao lines. In central areas of Laos
                                the teams were largely comprised of Lao, while in southern Laos they
                                were predominately Kha tribal minorities. The teams were ostensibly
                                designated as <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> commando or
                                guerrilla units and were paid through <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>.</note> This will require expansion of secret base

                            Vietnamese. An effective BV–33 would be very useful in harassing any

                            developments is attached.<note n="6" xml:id="d42fn6">Apparent reference

                                to Trueheart that concluded that Communist activities in the Plain
                                of Jars and the Tchepone areas were related to two separate
                                objectives: (1) strengthening the Pathet Lao position in the Plain,
                                and (2) North Vietnamese support for Viet Cong forces in South
                                Vietnam. <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> suggested that the
                                attacks in the Plain were consistent with routine clearing
                                operations and concluded that there was no evidence of serious
                                danger to the non-Communist position there. <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> suggested the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese were
                                following a wait and see approach. Because of its control and use
                                for infiltration of the Tchepone-Muong Phine area, North Vietnam was
                                unlikely to under take an offensive there for fear of encouraging
                                    <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> attack or South Vietnamese

                            on the situation in Laos by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cline</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">According to <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Bromley Smith</persName>'s account of this
                                meeting (in which the starting time is given as 5 p.m.), Cline
                                stated that the expanded Pathet Lao forces had a “50–50 chance” of
                                overrunning all other non-Communist forces, but if joined by
                                pro-Communist neutral and North Vietnamese troops, all Laos could
                                fall quickly without warning. (Johnson Library, National Security

                            from actions against the neutralists and rightists<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">

                            government. With respect to the area around Tchepone he said that we
                            have some indications of a step-up in North Vietnamese logistic
                            capabilities and that patrols will be authorized in the Tchepone area
                            for intelligence purposes under certain policy restrictions. Also a
                            limited number of low level air photographic reconnaissance missions
                            will be run into this area.</p>
                        <p>3. The President asked what <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>'s position was on this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> would generally support such
                            actions, but that some reservations had been expressed by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>. He then said it was
                            believed necessary to take some of these steps in any case.<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4">In <persName corresp="#p_SB1">Smith</persName>'s
                                account of this meeting, the President ordered that proposals for
                                reconnaissance be presented to Unger again in light of new
                                information on infiltration and the military build up so that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> could give his best
                                estimate of the political effect of the reconnaissance in Laos.
                                (Ibid.)</note> The Director requested at least twenty-four hours
                            delay on the air photo recommendations in order to process these
                            properly through COMOR. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> also requested twenty-four hours to secure
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> comments on the patrol idea. It
                            was thus agreed that these matters would be processed through these
                            channels and taken up at a later meeting. (It was later set for
                                Saturday.)<note n="5" xml:id="d43fn5">May 1. No record of the

                        <p>4. Following the President's departure it was agreed that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s comments would be
                            sought on the air photography point and that this matter would be
                            processed through COMOR. With respect to patrols, General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> was the center of an animated
                            discussion in which he took the position that only battalion size
                            operations had any <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0112"/>change of

                                results of these efforts, encompassing operations run over the past
                                two years, have not been outstandingly productive and have lead the
                                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to the firm conclusion that
                                large team operations offer the only reasonable chance for
                                worthwhile intelligence missions.” (Central Intelligence Agency, DCI

                            He finally settled on the position of being given the mission of
                            conducting intelligence probes within this area with the limitation that
                            his forces could not exceed 50 to 100 man patrols. A cable so specifying
                            will be prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName>. In the course of this discussion General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> commented that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s crossborder operations to his
                            knowledge had never produced any real information and that these must be
                            run on a more substantial military basis. His primary target in this
                            discussion was the State Department as he expressed some impatience over
                            the need for detailed information south of Tchepone beyond what was
                            available unless it was proposed to do something about these areas.</p>

                            I think I am accurate in stating the two positions as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0113"/>
                        <p>When <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Max Taylor</persName> talks, he is
                            representing a composite view of the Chiefs. There is an element in that
                            body (presently Admiral <persName corresp="#p_MDADL1">McDonald</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LMGCE1">LeMay</persName>) who wish to bomb or otherwise interdict the
                            infiltration routes in Laos. This is consistent with their view that the
                            war in Vietnam is essentially a conventional one, which should be fought
                            by the United States with all the conventional resources at our
                            disposal, especially those which involve a minimum loss of American
                            life, i.e. air and sea power. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> have a more sophisticated view of the military
                            situation in Southeast Asia, but they are naturally unwilling to ask a
                            subordinate command (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>) to undertake
                            an action which in their view can have no real military effect on the
                            enemy. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> probes
                            deeply into the soft spot of the State position when he suggests that it
                            may not be worth risking the Geneva Accords merely for small probes to
                            gather intelligence of doubtful value. In other words, General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> would prefer actually to invest
                            a Viet Minh base in Laos even at the cost of a pitched battle, rather
                            than to send a hundred men on a mission which he does not believe would
                            be successful.</p>
                        <p>The State Department, on the other hand, is fundamentally worried about
                            the precarious situation in Laos. I suspect that the position they took
                            today was an attempt to appease the military and to satisfy their own
                            need for hard information without compromising that fundamental
                            interest. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>, and
                            probably Bob McNamara, saw through this maneuver quickly.</p>
                        <p>In my own opinion, our real problem is that we have given to the military
                                (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>) missions in South Vietnam
                            which they are unwilling and unable effectively to perform. We do want
                            hard intelligence on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, both for military and
                            political reasons; but in the getting of it, we do not want an overt
                            invasion of Laos at this time. Our regular military command structure
                            has neither the desire nor the capability of tackling such a messy
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Until August of last year the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> was
                            preparing and beginning to carry out just the kinds of operations we
                            were talking about this afternoon. As I have explained to you in
                            previous memoranda, they were called off this and several other jobs in
                            Vietnam in “Operation Switchback” and transferred virtually all <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operational assets in Vietnam to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. It will be extremely difficult
                            partially to reverse this transfer; but if I were the President, I would
                            tell my people to try to get it done.</p>

                        <p>The meeting began without the President. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to review the problem of the
                            use of electronic countermeasures (ECM) on U–2s overflying Cuba.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows 6 pages of discussion unrelated to Laos.]</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            said the experts on Laos were prepared to give a short briefing if the
                            President so desired.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName>Bundy</persName> briefed on the operations
                            which were now being carried out. No request for additional authority
                            was made to the President. The cross-border patrols and low-level
                            reconnaissance missions, which the concerned Departments in Washington
                            agree upon, will be undertaken. They fall within the authority given by
                            the President following Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s last trip to Vietnam. Certain of the
                            operations which were opposed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> for political reasons will not be undertaken for
                            the time being.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he agreed that
                            we should postpone for a week low-level reconnaissance, but he did not
                            wish to delay much longer. The need to know more about what is going on
                            in Laos as regards the infiltration of men and equipment is so great
                            that a decision needs to be taken soon if our information is to be
                            augmented. He suggested that we should persuade <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> to ask the
                            International Control Commission (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>)
                            to undertake the intelligence missions we would like to see carried out.
                            We could offer to hold up low-level reconnaissance if the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> would agree to undertake the necessary
                            missions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the Viet
                            Cong is increasing its pressure in the areas north of South Vietnam. He
                            cited a significant communications buildup which might mean that a major
                            effort was being undertaken by the North Vietnamese to increase their
                            military buildup for use either in Laos or in South Vietnam. He agreed
                            we should wait for a week to see what developments take place in Laos.
                            Our capability to undertake low-level reconnaissance will be brought to
                            a 24- to 48-hour readiness status.</p>

                        <p>1. The first part of the meeting was addressed to Cuba.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to Laos, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> briefed on the plans for increasing intelligence
                            coverage of the routes through Laos to South Vietnam. He stated that
                            Presidential approval had previously been obtained for the actions
                            mentioned. He said that small patrols would be authorized in the areas
                            north and east of Tchepone, with air in-and-ex-filtration, although it
                            will take several weeks to launch the first of these patrols. With
                            respect to air photo reconnaissance, pursuant to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s reservations, these will be
                            withheld, but a new look will be taken after a week. Meanwhile specific
                            targets for these will be determined. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believed that we should not
                            postpone these more than a week or so unless Souvanna clearly moves to
                            take action. He suggested that we urge the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to inspect the Tchepone area and begin our overflights
                            and offer to suspend our overflights if the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> carries out proper inspection. (Action: <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>/TBL with <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>—Please keep in
                            touch with the list of specific targets.)</p>
                        <p>2. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> also added that an effort will be made
                            to establish a single point at which detailed reports from all sources
                            can be immediately analyzed in Washington, to analyze the traffic
                            running over the routes from North Vietnam into southern Laos, and
                            arrangements made to cross-fertilize the various intelligence operations
                            in the area. (Action: <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            arrange for immediate integration of Vientiane reporting and participate
                            with <gloss target="#t_OCI1">OCI</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss>, etc., in <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0116"/>this
                            center). Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            emphasized that this information is badly needed as there has been a
                            sharp increase in communications between North Vietnam and Viet Cong
                            stations on the Lao/South Vietnam border, indicating a sharp upsurge in
                            Viet Cong attention to this area.</p>

                            usual efforts before rainy season sets in to improve their military
                            positions and secure lines of supply. Principal effort now appears be
                            aimed at Tha Thom (which reported to have fallen May 14), with some
                            action also threatened northern Plaine des Jarres sector toward Munong
                            Soui. Heart of Plaine des Jarres itself now under <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> guns but since taking of Phou San there have been no
                            important indications of further push in that area. First stages these
                            actions already evident before April 19 coup and could represent nothing
                            more than continuation persistent <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            effort take over all areas which occupied separately or jointly by them
                            and neutralists as of June 1962.</p>
                        <p>If this continues be Communist policy we can expect <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> forces stop short of Mekong itself.
                            In Tha Thom sector this would probably mean advance up to but not
                            including Borikane (UF 6653). While further improvements of <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> positions might be made in Plaine
                            des Jarres and effort made cut route between Plaine and Munong Soui,
                            would not anticipate, under this thesis, effort to push neutralists off
                            Plaine.</p>
                        <p>We are however in new situation which may result in change in Communist
                            calculations and therefore possibly intention on their part <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0117"/>move farther than in past and even make
                            all-out effort take over all of Laos including Mekong lowland. Thus far
                            we have no indications any such change but believe it wise consider what
                            this would call for on our part in way of contingency plans and
                            decisions, together with possible deterrent measures to be taken
                            now.</p>
                        <p>(1) April 19 coup introduced new element and may have been taken by
                            Communists, who firmly persuaded U.S. and other anti-Communist nations
                            in region supported it, as indication U.S. has backed away from
                                Khrushchev-<persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> decision
                            of July 1961 and means install regime in Vientiane which will work for
                            military solution. Communists might consider such a U.S. shift as
                            logical accompaniment our firm policy South Viet Nam. This might
                            persuade Communists that with political excuse of coup available to them
                            and while military leadership in Vientiane thoroughly confused, this is
                            moment take advantage their clearly superior position and take over.</p>

                                he had merged both neutralist and rightist factions and that he
                                would lead both. On May 13 the Souvanna government announced that it
                                had merged the neutralist forces with <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>. Souphanouvong demanded a return to tripartite
                                government. (Airgram A–341 from Vientiane, May 14; ibid., POL 27
                                LAOS)</note> may be persuading Communists that Souvanna has lost
                            last vestige neutrality (as seen through their eyes) and they no longer
                            have any reason restrain themselves because of disappearance all hope of
                            using him to their advantage.</p>
                        <p>(3) Although we have no overt indication of this, also conceivable that
                            Communists have changed their assessment of U.S. position and no longer
                            fear prompt response from us if they should approach Mekong. Factors
                            contributing to such an appreciation by Communists, if this is case,
                            would be our decision not to move against North Viet Nam directly, at
                            least now; reluctance become involved in any more military actions in
                            election year; and absence any sharp U.S. reaction to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/Viet Minh advance almost to Mekong in
                            Thakhek area last January.</p>
                        <p>Thus first question is whether we should seek some way tell Communists
                            that we continue be prepared resist with force their stepping over
                            invisible line guarding Mekong lowland. We would of course wish do this
                            in such way as to avoid persuading them, in line with point 1 above,
                            that U.S. bent on resumption warfare in Laos. Tend to agree with Amb
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> that deployment U.S.
                            troops does not provide satisfactory answer; on one hand there is Thai
                            reluctance increase their involvement to this degree if they cannot be
                            assured our readiness follow through if challenged and on other hand I
                            am not sure how seriously it would be taken by Communists unless it were
                            considerably larger scale than in 1962. More persuasive, I believe,
                            would be 7th Fleet action off North Vietnamese <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0118"/>coast which would not involve Thais but rather be
                            pointed directly at North Vietnamese who pull strings in Laos and would
                            also represent pressure which could be applied selectively.<note n="4" xml:id="d47fn4">In telegram 1006 to Vientiane, May 16, the
                                Department broadly agreed with the assessment of Pathet Lao/Viet
                                Minh intentions, but doubted that “7th Fleet action could convey
                                clear signal to Hanoi, i.e., that it would be taken as warning of
                                resolve to hold Mekong lowlands.” For this reason and because it did
                                not wish to “overwork this gambit,” the Department was not following
                                    <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s suggestion on
                                moving the fleet to off the North Vietnamese coast. (Ibid., POL

                        <p>At same time we must of course be ready with our plans for direct
                            military action, including use of U.S. and/or <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> troops, in case becomes clear Communists intend seize
                            lowland to any significant degree. Under such circumstances believe
                            government would request <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and/or
                            U.S. forces sent to support it to cross Mekong and take principal towns
                            along river at least, so that Communist forces could not credibly charge
                            invasion but would be themselves clear aggressors against lowland
                            territory still held by government. I realize this question becomes
                            immediately involved in highly classified U.S. and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> planning and I mean only to suggest
                            it be kept under constant review, particularly should there in future be
                            any clear sign that Communists will not this time be inhibited, as in
                            past, from establishing themselves on Mekong. Should this occur we would
                            still have choice available as to whether we wished accompany action

                        <p>1329. This morning I raised three questions with Souvanna and got
                            following answers:</p>
                        <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0119"/>
                        <p>1) If appropriate targets presented themselves would Souvanna agree to
                            use of bombs by T–28's under present circumstances? Souvanna promptly
                            replied that he would, adding only that target selection should be
                            worked out in conjunction with General Amkha. Therefore we are now
                            seeking get Gens Ma and Amkha together to bring T–28's into action, if
                            they can be useful. I take Souvanna's okay to cover not only 100 lb but
                            also, if necessary, 500 lb bombs.</p>
                        <p>2) I referred to US-piloted T–28's in Udorn which I said could be
                            promptly converted to be indistinguishable from Lao T–28's and flown
                            with considerable effectiveness in sorties against <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> in present situation (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 5197; March 052153Z).<note n="2" xml:id="d48fn2">Not found.</note> I said I had been assured this
                            could be done without American involvement becoming known. Souvanna
                            concurred in this action.</p>
                        <p>3) I exposed to Souvanna idea convening <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> military advisors in Bangkok (as set forth Deptel
                            1006, para 4)<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">See <ref target="#d47fn4">footnote 4, Document 47</ref>.</note> and Souvanna said he
                            thought this might have useful effect. He went on to speculate that
                            current action here as well as South Viet-Nam probably timed from North
                            Viet-Nam to coincide with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> visit Saigon and he volunteered thought that
                            direct action (e.g. 7th Fleet against North Viet-Nam) would also provide
                            effective warning.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna informed me that as of about 1030 am Gen Amkha in touch with
                                <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> (not clear whether at
                            Muong Phan or at Ban Khong, TG 9345). At about 1115 Col Law expected
                            land Muong Phan if appears clear from air that situation permits.
                            Thereafter we should have better understanding of Plaine des Jarres
                            situation. Souvanna also told me <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss>
                            currently only about 30 kms north of Paksane; this word given him by Gen

                            Denson and Munro have diplomatic actions well in hand and I am
                            concentrating on material help to defending forces.</p>
                        <p>Do I have authority to: 1) bring 500 lb bombs into Laos and employ them
                            and 2) can US T–28's from Udorn be employed as discussed above?<note n="4" xml:id="d48fn4">In telegram 1007 to Vientiane, May 17, 4:52

                            may I say to you what I would have been saying to Mike in last couple of

                        <p> B: Yes.</p>
                        <p> H: I don't think we are hitting this thing hard enough. Morale very bad.
                            I have recommended for some time that we put two battalions back in [to
                            Thailand]. We have just got to do something to support morale.</p>
                        <p> B: The only objection I have seen to putting those troops in is the
                            Thais are so strongly against it.</p>
                        <p> H: If they [Pathet Lao/North Vietnamese] move into the Mekong, we have
                            got to do something to stop them. Have you seen the telegram in from
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> saying he has talked to

                        <p> B: What do you mean, Averell?</p>
                        <p> H: If we send the low-flying reconnaissance in, it will be an indication
                            that we have a very serious interest in where they are and what they are
                            doing.</p>
                        <p> B: We have flown some low-flying reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p> H: Only in Laos. Not in North Vietnam. I thought it was agreed we would
                            fly over supply routes in North Vietnam and that was cut out after I
                            left the room. We've got to send a message which is thoroughly
                            understandable. I think we should consider flying over Hanoi. It is all
                            very serious; I have been very cautious about all this, as you know, but
                            I think there comes a time when if you are overly cautious it is not
                            good.</p>
                        <p> B: The whole problem about Moscow is they don't have much to say about
                            it.</p>
                        <p> H: No, they're not interested. One of the staff of the Embassy keeps in
                            touch with Bill Sullivan, knew him at the Laos Conference. He saw
                                <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> and said that Pushkin
                            had indicated they would agree to talk about it, but that I turned them
                            down. That just isn't true. I think I have six times taken up with
                            Pushkin about taking up with North Vietnam and getting them to call off
                            the dogs. The major thing Khrushchev has in mind is row with Peking. It
                            is a long shot but I think our being ready to be vigorous will have more
                            influence on them than to sit back and try to get him to pull chestnuts
                            out of the fire. They're not going to do that.</p>
                        <p> B: I agree with that.</p>
                        <p> H: As of the moment I would take two steps—have low level flights over
                            North Vietnam. There are supply dump, airfield, and roads which we know
                            about from high level reconnaissance. The other thing I would do is ask
                            the Thais whether they can't agree to put these troops in; that we
                            cannot decide what we do later but we have every intention of taking
                            steps to protect the Mekong and having these troops in will help further
                            steps. They have moved their own troops in, and I think we should have
                            some witness to the world that we are doing something.</p>
                        <p> B: I agree with you Averell.</p>
                        <p> H: This may be a signal to them. Very hard to know what the facts are.
                            Pathet Lao is hot-headed. They are commanded now by two Peking-trained
                            people. North Vietnamese have a certain hot- headedness. I don't believe
                            at this time that ChiComs want to take on United States. Of course, one
                            can't do anything without thinking that this may be in their minds. But
                            they are going after a show of peace to the world, sending people to
                            Africa, etc. Trying to compete with Khrushchev in more vigorous way.
                            This would reverse their policy in India. Well, this is what I would be
                            saying to Mike if he were here, and I wanted to tell you what I
                            think.</p>

                            level reconnaissance means anything and would prove weakness, not

                            what they did in the Plaines de Jars yesterday. Laos [is] not afraid of
                            outside attack; North Vietnam is. I wish I could be more helpful.</p>

                        <p>1. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> presided throughout the meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. Southeast Asia. <persName>Bundy</persName> opened the meeting by
                            saying that the next two or three days would be spent on Southeast Asia,
                            and that other members of the staff who could run a continent without
                            coming to him were encouraged to do so.</p>
                        <p>Nothing more was said on Southeast Asia during the meeting, but afterward
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> asked Clif Alexander (the Southeast Asia
                            expert in <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>'s absence)
                            and myself to stop by his office.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion unrelated to Laos.]</p>
                        <p>4. Discussion in <persName>Bundy</persName>'s Office. In his office
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> showed <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1">Alexander</persName> and myself the latest cables from Laos. Then,
                            by way of direct conversation and through our overhearing his telephone
                            conversations with <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, and his brother, he
                            let it be known that he was <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0126"/>about
                            to ask Presidential approval for intensified reconnaissance and for the
                            use of some US civilian pilots in Laos. He also asked State and Defense
                            to look into the matter of sending troops to Thailand. On this last
                            point he asked me what the Chiefs thought of it, and I replied that,
                            although I didn't know in this particular context, in general they were
                            somewhat reluctant to do this and nothing else.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> then commented that it probably was that
                            the Chiefs thought that we had gotten all the mileage out of troop
                            movements that we could. I said I thought it would be something along
                            those lines. The discussion on that point ended there.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_HAFD1">Alexander</persName> to pull together the diplomatic temperature
                            and the reactions to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            conversations with various people. In particular,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> may be taking a stronger line diplomatically than
                            the government has yet reached decisions on. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            then asked me to help keep him posted on military planning.</p>

                            <item>A Program for Laos and South Vietnam</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. To meet the current Communist threat in Laos and Vietnam essentially
                            two extreme courses of action are now being discussed: a) salvaging what
                            we can by negotiations at Geneva; or b) carrying the war directly to
                            Hanoi. Whatever the advantages of either course (we think <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0128"/>they are limited) the risks (political
                            in the case of Geneva and political as well as military in the case of
                            Hanoi) are so high as to warrant a searching examination of yet another
                            alternative. We call this, for want of a better name, “massive
                            counterinsurgency.” We recognize that this may be regarded as “more of
                            the same” rather than as a genuine alternative to either of the two
                            extreme courses. We believe, however, that what follows represents a
                            difference in kind from the present US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> effort in implementation as well as conception.</p>
                        <p>2. The Program</p>
                        <p>In brief, what is proposed is that the defense and stabilization of the
                            situation in South Vietnam (and Laos) be accomplished by a substantial
                            change in the nature of the counterinsurgency program and certain
                            substantial increases in its scale. This to be supplemented by intense
                            psychological warfare pressures and selected military action (including,
                            but not necessarily limited to bombing) against the Communists in South
                            Vietnam and Laos as well as in North Vietnam. Such a program would
                            necessarily require further inputs of personnel by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, a reorientation of US military and
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> programs, some changes in the US
                            organizational and command structure, and putting the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> on a “war footing.” These actions would
                            probably involve additional requirements for US personnel directly
                            involved in the counterinsurgency effort of as much as 5,000 men.
                            Perhaps a corresponding economy could be achieved among US military and
                            civilian personnel presently in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. The “oil spot” concept is the key to victory in South Vietnam, and its
                            objective is the population, who must be given something to fight for
                            and something to fight with. They must also be supported by the regular
                            forces against the larger <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> units now
                            prevalent, and these regular forces must give this supporting,
                            reinforcing, and protective mission priority over attempts to find and
                            kill the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. In order to insure maximum attention to the development of this
                            counterinsurgency approach <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> should
                            develop such local political and paramilitary forces as feasible, among
                            the Montagnards, the Cao Dai, the Hwa [<hi rend="italic">Hoa</hi>] Hao,
                            etc.). These would be supplementary to the <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss>, SDC, etc. In order to carry this out, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would establish officers in the local
                            areas with direct lines of command to Saigon and direct logistical and
                            financial support. This is not a reversal of Switchback; it is an
                            extension of the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> capability to
                            conduct political and paramilitary actions in a flexible manner into new
                            fields, leaving to the regular military and aid programs the development
                            of the more organized and orthodox national forces.</p>
                        <p>5. Essential to the oil spot approach is a program of local self defense,
                            which is where we believe the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> can
                            make an important contribution and we suggest that the Agency re-enter
                            this field on a large scale. Thus, we propose:</p>
                        <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0129"/>
                        <p>a. There should be established in each province of South Vietnam an
                            officer not necessarily <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, in charge
                            of counterinsurgency. He would have on his staff a USOM man and an
                            officer of the US Special Forces or Marines. The latter, in turn, would
                            have under his command up to 100 specially trained and indoctrinated US
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>b. The Province counterinsurgency group would report, over its own
                            communications, to a counter-insurgency command center in Saigon, [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>].
                            This command center would be directly under the Ambassador and would
                            have the same status in Saigon as <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>,
                            USOM, etc.</p>
                        <p>c. Consideration should be given to establishing regional
                            counterinsurgency commands (the Delta, the Montagnard area, etc.).</p>
                        <p>d. US Special Forces Officers would function on a “counterpart” basis at
                            the hamlet level and would be the action element in carrying out the
                            elementary economic and social measures that are needed to provide the
                            positive element to defend as well as to instruct the locals in their
                            own self defense. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>, and Special Forces officers would
                            travel constantly through the Provinces to see that the programs are
                            being implemented.</p>
                        <p>6. These proposals are designed to supplement rather than replace the
                            regular <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and military programs in
                            Vietnam. In essence, the regular, more orthodox programs should be
                            designed to support the local counterinsurgency effort at least until
                            the situation is stabilized.</p>
                        <p>7. We recognize that the proposals involving increased counterinsurgency
                            activity with <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> participation, entail
                            a number of adjustments in the chain of command structure: the
                            relationship of the military and <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            personnel on the counterinsurgency group to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and USOM, the relationship of the counterinsurgency
                            command to the Commanding General, Vietnam. We believe, however, that if
                            the concept of massive counterinsurgency is adopted, these command
                            relationships could be easily worked out.</p>
                        <p>8. To supplement a vastly increased counterinsurgency effort within South
                            Vietnam, the US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> should undertake a
                            stepped-up program of psychological warfare against North Vietnam. This
                            would include diplomatic, military, propaganda and economic pressures.
                            This would also involve a program of bombing Communist targets,
                            especially in Laos, but leading close to the North Vietnam frontier and
                            into North Vietnam if necessary. This is relatively low-risk in Laos,
                            and would encourage our friends and perhaps give pause to one enemy.
                            (The pilots should be in the first instance Lao [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], phasing into the
                            use of US pilots.) The initial military target inside Laos would be in
                            the Plaine des Jarres area, along Routes 12A and 12B, Route 9, leading
                            then along Route 7 towards the North Vietnamese frontier. These attacks
                            would be more in the nature of a psychological pressure program than an
                            all out military attack. They would have some <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0130"/>slight military value in interfering with Communist
                            supply routes, but their main objective would be to demonstrate an
                            increasing determination on the US side to press the bombing into North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>9. In Laos, it is recommended that all of the villages on our side be
                            approached with the same philosophy as in South Vietnam, adapted as
                            necessary to local conditions. Enterprising Lao have demonstrated in
                            several instances that it can be done. In this way the areas on our side
                            of the ill-defined informal partition could be secured by the villagers
                            themselves. The <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>'s mission would
                            become a defensive one in support of calls for help from any village
                            complex that comes under attack. Since the attack on a village if
                            properly defended has to be fairly large scale, the political noise
                            level to the Communists would rise and they would also be vulnerable to
                            aerial attacks. This tactic should remove the scattered Pathet Lao bands
                            on our side of the informal partition and provide the basis for
                            long-term political development in Laos. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Southeast Asia Counterinsurgency Command</p>
                        <p>10. We suggest that the idea of a civilian counterinsurgency command for
                            Southeast Asia be explored. Such a command would have general authority
                            over counterinsurgency programs with, of course, major emphasis on South
                            Vietnam and Laos. This command would be directly responsible to
                            Washington and have authority to guide, expedite, and inspect the
                            counterinsurgency programs in various countries under its aegis. Its
                            primary responsibility would be to augment and coordinate current
                            counterinsurgency programs. The command will also have authority to
                            recommend appropriate military and psychological meas- ures against the
                            enemy to affect his will to press the current insurgency effort.</p>
                        <p>11. The functions of the command would be:</p>
                        <p>a. To guide, expedite, and inspect the work of all agencies and their
                            concentration on the implementation of the approved strategy, i.e., the

                            opportunity, however valid, not overall or detailed planning or
                            comprehensive reporting.</p>

                        <p>1395. We may at this point in Laos be on watershed between (a) continued
                            Communist military attacks driving at or very near to Vientiane and
                            Paksane or (b) at the end of this dry season's pressure except for few
                            consolidating and mopping-up operations. We are not disposed here to
                            think that Communists this time do intend move to Mekong although their
                            calculations in this regard may have been changed by some new elements
                            in picture. These are (a) Souvanna's much more outspoken and consistent
                            anti-Communist position which has finished any lingering Communist hope
                            that he can be used to gain their ends and (b) our reconnaissance
                            flights over <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> Trail
                            which Communists may regard as prelude to serious assault on that
                            corridor. Since corridor certainly represents major North Vietnamese
                            interest in Laos, they might be driven to more extreme action if they
                            become persuaded their continued use of it is threatened.</p>
                        <p>More likely hypothesis is that recent rash of fighting just about over,
                            having resulted in body blow to neutralist forces, from which they may
                            or may not recover, and having acquired for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM prize geographical base for future harassment and
                            advances in all directions northern Laos. If this is case, however much
                            right wing and even Souvanna will protest about being devoured by
                            Communists bite by bite, we (i.e. Western Powers) might accept new
                            situation and try live with new state of affairs as we have lived with
                            other unsatisfactory situations in Laos before. It would of course be a
                            good deal harder to get acceptance of this course of action in Vientiane
                            even than in past and would be much harder to live with our friends here
                            in future, unless we considerably increased military help and showed
                            ourselves much less restrained by Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <p>A fuller discussion of implications this course of action contained
                                <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>.<note n="2" xml:id="d56fn2">Telegram 1398 from Vientiane, May 22. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Under this we would seek to avoid involving ourselves in another
                            conference and another set of accords, which could only be worse than
                            last and where we might put ourselves in position of being obliged to
                            beat an even more recalcitrant right wing (and perhaps Souvanna too)
                            into negotiations and concessions to Pathet Lao which we full well know
                            could only benefit latter. In other words should we not seriously <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0132"/>consider drawing the line at
                            this point and living with an even uneasier peace than before and
                            something shakier than our accustomed instability rather than pretending
                            that there is a possibility of peaceful co-existence with Communists in
                            Laos? Of course, if an international conference could buy some
                            worthwhile concessions it might have some value but otherwise I can't
                            see why we should go into it and I would hope we could persuade enough
                            of our friends of the rightness of this position that we could avoid
                            finding ourselves so uncomfortably isolated as to feel obliged to give
                            in.</p>
                        <p>With the French proposal and their current pressures on Souvanna, coupled
                            with Communist line that is becoming daily clearer, we obviously will
                            very soon have to adopt clear course or find ourselves swept along by
                            force of events. It seems increasingly clear that it is Communist
                            strategy to present Souvanna as prisoner or puppet of right wing and to
                            present government in Vientiane as fictitious. In short order I expect
                            them to say they cannot accept <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> as in position speak for Laos. They may go to
                            point of even withdrawing diplomatic representation and, if there were a
                            call for article 4 consultations from Souvanna, they would most probably
                            not attend or, if they did, would not accept that he represents the
                            Royal Laotian Government. At a Geneva type conference I would expect
                            them to accord Souvanna role merely of representative of one of three
                            tendencies and in no sense able to speak for Laos as a whole.</p>
                        <p>I believe this is line we must do our utmost to combat and frustrate and
                            in conversation with U.K., France and Australian colleagues this morning
                            I emphasized this point. Particularly for benefit of Millet whose
                            government's officials (Paris to Dept 5565<note n="3" xml:id="d56fn3">Dated May 21. (Ibid.)</note>) talk of Souvanna as “prisoner of
                            right.” Souvanna as we all well know has many times threatened to resign

                            no physical compulsion today and if he wished would not have slightest
                            difficulty in leaving country. He apparently has been so thoroughly
                            disillusioned and discouraged by Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
                            behaviour that he no longer feels able work on his earlier cherished
                            hopes of bringing about reconciliation. As for Souvanna not being free
                            here, there of course comes immediately to mind contrast with Pathet Lao
                            zone where he may not even enter without express permission. Colleagues
                            here make much of Polish two-day incarceration, current plight of North
                            Vietnamese Embassy, continued though moderated censorship, etc. all of

                            correction of these errors but don't dwell on them so as to <pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0133"/>play into Communist hands when grounds

                        <p>French are obviously obsessed with idea that tripartite balance must be
                            restored and I am persuaded Millet using all effort with Souvanna to

                        <p>In light all this we come to immediate question of international

                            as Communists would have it or in slightly modified form proposed by

                            entirely (for example Secretary's statement Depcir 2133<note n="5" xml:id="d56fn5">Dated May 17. ( Ibid., POL 27 LAOS)</note> which

                            position since we know nothing can come out of conference that would in
                            any way improve situation in Laos from our point of view. I believe our
                            answer to pressure for conference should be two-fold:</p>
                        <p>(A) Article 4 consultations requested by PriMin should proceed in first
                            instance to solidify PriMin's position and define issues and strategy of
                            friends if there is to be a conference and</p>
                        <p>(B) Conference would be accepted only if it brought in advance clear
                            gain, such as cease-fire coupled with withdrawal throughout Laos of
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces to April or May 1963
                            positions (i.e. following Neut-<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> break).
                            (If, of course, current Pathet Lao/Viet Minh military attacks continue
                            and cannot be contained and we are not willing intervene militarily to
                            block them, we might have to buy cease-fire with conference.)</p>
                        <p>If Pathet Lao-Viet Minh pressure continues strong and we give
                            consideration to military intervention, or if we come to conclusion that
                            even with let up by Pathet Lao today we cannot expect to have viable
                            free Laos with Plaine des Jarres severed from it, then another possible
                            course of action outlined septel may have to be considered. This would
                            entail a sharp and limited employment of U.S. forces to retake Plaine

                        <p>2. The Communists would be far less inhibited and prevented from
                            covert-type actions than we would be, were the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to get itself in the act.</p>

                            what we can do about it. There was not sufficient time for <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> to clear with the Ambassador and other

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has stated that
                            he would accept a “Geneva” conference on Laos subject to several
                            preconditions, of which the most notable are withdrawal of Communist
                            forces from areas previously occupied by the neutralists (principally
                            the western part of the Plaine des Jarres) and reaffirmation of his own
                            status and full power as head of the government. We are strongly
                            supporting these preconditions, and are pressing the British and
                            friendly signatories of the 1962 Accords to do likewise.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we propose, if a conference should ever meet, to press for
                            full compliance with the Geneva Accords of 1962 as our objective. This
                            would include total withdrawal of North Vietnamese forces from Laos and
                            an end to the corridor through Laos from North Viet-Nam to South
                            Viet-Nam. Both of these Communist actions have persisted since 1962; we
                            have protested against them frequently, but in practice have taken no
                            stronger action.</p>
                        <p>Probable Communist Reaction to this Position (We assume that the
                            Communists do not enlarge their present military actions to a further
                            offensive. If they did so, we would have immediately to consider drastic
                            action both within Laos and against North Viet-Nam.)</p>
                        <p>Unless further pressure is applied, the Communists are virtually certain
                            not to withdraw their forces from the neutralist areas of the Plaine des
                            Jarres. Moreover, they will undoubtedly fight any clear affirmation of
                            Souvanna's power and legitimacy, and at least seek to argue at length
                            that they were justified in boycotting the government, that Souvanna is
                            a prisoner of the right-wing generals, etc. Thus, if we, and Souvanna,
                            and the British, adhere to these preconditions—as we must seek to do—we
                            shall be at an impasse with the Communist side. They may well cease any
                            further military action, so that we would have virtually a de facto
                            ceasefire. But they are unlikely to go further.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">US Options</p>
                        <p>The US could take further military actions within Laos at any time. We
                            have already introduced jet reconnaissance flights and have now
                            authorized US civilians to fly <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> prop
                            fighter bombers against Communist positions. Our next actions in Laos
                            could include the use of US aircraft in Thailand, South Viet-Nam or from
                            carriers to bomb Communist positions in Laos.</p>
                        <p>This should be done only on the request of Souvanna and a major problem
                            might be that, although he might well request some quantity of such
                            action, he is basically concerned about destructions in Laos and might
                            not wish us to push it far without himself pressing us to go at once
                            against North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>Our action could further include deployment of ground and especially air
                            units to Thailand both to step up such air actions and to convey at
                            least a threat of ground action by US forces within Laos. If we do
                            deploy forces to Thailand, we could probably get the British,
                            Australians, New Zealanders, and possibly the Philippines, to join with
                            us, but it is less clear that any of these nations would join in actual
                            attacks into Laos.</p>
                        <p>Once we started overt US military attacks into Laos, we would be forcing
                            even more of a showdown and making it even more imperative that we not
                            withdraw from our insistence on Communist withdrawal. By such attacks,
                            we could inflict substantial damage on the Pathet Lao and could perhaps
                            try to single out North Vietnamese troops for such attention. However,
                            even in the face of such damage, the chances cannot be considered great
                            that the Communists would withdraw, since to do so would represent the
                            loss of the major morale and material gains they have made by their
                            recent actions.</p>
                        <p>Thus, we could arrive at the point where we would virtually have to
                            consider attacking North Viet-Nam in order to prevail in the contest of
                            wills. Thus, in effect, the “Laos route” could lead us to the point of
                            attacking North Viet-Nam, and could compress any timetable we might have
                            for taking such action based on our wider view that it had become
                            essential to hold South Viet-Nam and the whole area.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the timing of such a showdown is to some extent within
                            our control. The various preconditions laid down by Souvanna,
                            particularly in the political sphere, could be negotiated for a
                            significant period of time before the withdrawal issue became the last
                            remaining one. We must not seem to be dodging that issue, but we need
                            not force it at once. For example, we could let the Article 4
                            consultations in Vientiane spin out a little on the issues of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and Souvanna's own position, employing
                            direct US military action only if the Communists did continue to move to
                            any degree. We might during this period still move forces to Thailand to
                            steady the situation and put ourselves in a position <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0140"/>to move fast and hard once we did
                            decide to act either within Laos or against North Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the course of events in Laos could burn out the fuse on a
                            decision to hit North Viet-Nam in a matter of 3 to 4 weeks, or it could
                            conceivably be strung out longer. But, now that we are launched on
                            insisting on the preconditions—which we could hardly have avoided—what
                            we must recognize above all is that there is almost bound to be a
                            showdown over these preconditions at some time in the next 1–3 months.
                            If we back down from such a showdown—by abandoning the precondition of
                            withdrawal—we will suffer a serious further loss of confidence among the
                            non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos in Relation to South Viet-Nam as a Peg for
                            Action Against the North</p>
                        <p>Up to a point, the Laos issue can be useful to us in preparing the way
                            for whatever action we want to take against North Viet-Nam. Our legal
                            case in Laos is strong, with widespread recognition that the Communist
                            attacks have been major violations and cannot be justified by the antics
                            of the right wing or by past occasional right-wing violations. This
                            helps us to bring the British and others along and gives a good legal
                            basis for opening moves we might want to make in any case.</p>
                        <p>However, as we approach the point of actually hitting North Viet-Nam,
                            justifying this on the basis of Laos would have little appeal to the
                            American public and probably would not seem appealing even to the
                            British and others. Thus, before we hit North Viet-Nam, we would wish to
                            justify such action not merely on account of Laos but, perhaps far more,
                            on the basis of the continued North Vietnamese aggression against South
                            Viet-Nam. The “Laos route” must merge with the “Souvanna Phouma route”
                            at this point and in fact become the smaller of the two.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Course of Events if Communists Do Accept
                            Withdrawal</p>
                        <p>On the lesser chance, that the Communists would accept withdrawal from
                            neutralist positions in the Plaine des Jarres, we would then be
                            virtually compelled to go on to a conference on Laos in Geneva or
                            preferably somewhere else. Such a conference would probably be a
                            prolonged “who struck John” exercise with endless argument about the
                            political problem and with we and perhaps others pressing for total
                            force withdrawal and the end of the corridor.</p>
                        <p>Such a conference, however, need not significantly affect either the
                            timing or the carrying out of actions against North Viet-Nam. The issues
                            are old ones and do not involve the loss of confidence that would be
                            entailed by our backing down on the immediate withdrawal issue. Indeed,
                            since we would have achieved our immediate objective of withdrawal, our
                            psychological position at such a conference would be fairly good.</p>

                        <p>In sum, if this should happen, the Laos problem as such could be put to
                            one side as a factor in our thinking whether to hit North Viet-Nam.</p>

                        <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> opened the
                            meeting by securing general approval of photo flights over the Plaine
                            des Jarres on 25 May. He commented that he had been disappointed with
                            the product from the low-level reconnaissance of the Tchepone area to
                            date.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then opened the
                            discussion of Vietnam. He stated, viewing Southeast Asia as a whole that
                            it is clear that South Vietnam is the lynch-pin, although Laos and
                            Cambodia also bear upon the matter. He emphasized that we have a good
                            political position with respect to Laos in our demand for return to the
                            1962 Accords and that it is important to exploit this. [Here follows
                            discussion on Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>3. The problem of what to do about Laos was discussed in considerable
                            depth, at the end of which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> was requested to draft a detailed scenario of
                            escalation of military action related to Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> indicated concern that we may have
                            an immediate problem on Laos and suggested that it might offer an
                            alternate route to action against <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0142"/>North Vietnam, on which our political base would be
                            better founded. While the U.S. public is not much interested in Laos,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought that the Ho Chi
                            Minh trail and the Viet Minh presence in Laos as related to South
                            Vietnam could associate the problems of Laos with the U.S. public's more
                            positive attitude toward Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought that it important to maintain pressure on
                            the pre-conditions for a Laos conference, such as restoring <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>'s positions on the Plaine des
                            Jarres by a Pathet Lao withdrawal, a cease fire throughout Laos,
                            strengthening of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and reaffirming
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s full
                            authority. At the conference itself there would be emphasis upon the Ho
                            Chi Minh trail and the Viet Minh presence, but an effort would be made
                            to restrict the conference to Laos rather than allowing it to spread
                            into Vietnam. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought
                            that the way to achieve the pre-conditions is to bring pressure on the
                            Pathet Lao through other governments. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that it would be necessary to use military
                            action to bring about these pre-conditions, e.g. dispatching U.S. Forces
                            to Thailand, bombing the Pathet Lao and possibly going ahead to bombing
                            North Vietnamese routes of access into Laos. Once the failure to obtain
                            the pre-conditions for a Lao conference is evident, particularly if this
                            involved extension of military action into North Vietnam, it would be
                            necessary to approach the Communists on the basis of Vietnam as well as
                            Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that
                            this would depend on the degree to which we force the pace. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought that the
                            operation could be divided into two phases, a diplomatic effort to
                            clarify our pre-conditions to a conference followed by the steps we
                            might take if these were not achieved; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> felt that U.S. military action at least to some
                            degree would be necessary in both phases. The DCI urged that we not
                            divert our attention from the main Vietnamese problem just to obtain
                            small diplomatic advantages based on Laos. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> felt that the U.S. position vis-a-vis
                            Laos would have an effect on Vietnamese morale.</p>
                        <p>4. With respect to Vietnam Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reiterated his concern at adopting a course of
                            action which might collapse because of poor performance or a collapse in
                            South Vietnam. He insisted therefore that firm commitments be obtained
                            from <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> at an early rather
                            than late stage on these matters. As an aside he said that he was
                            investigating the potential for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council sponsorship of a UN Commission to cover the
                            Lao/Cambodia border.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion related exclusively to Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>11. [Here follows discussion on Vietnam.] Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reverted to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s interest in Laos,
                            commenting that we might be able to move into a North Vietnam program
                            via the Laotian problem or we might even be forced into considering it
                            by the situation in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> brought out the point that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> might cave in under too
                            large a U.S. support of Laos.</p>

                        <p>1. The purpose of the meeting was to review the situation in Southeast
                            Asia and for the President to receive the views developed at the Sunday
                            morning meeting (memorandum of which is being prepared by <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">
                                <ref target="#d61">Document 61</ref>.</note>), and to decide on
                            actions to be taken.</p>
                        <p>2. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pursued his
                            position at this morning's meeting; namely, that action taken against
                            North Vietnam should be in response to <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0144"/>violations of the 1962 Laotian Agreement. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> disagreed, stating that there
                            would be little public support for a reaction because of any issue in
                            Laos, as Laos is not in particular the popular or important issue with
                            the people of the United States.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> felt that it would be
                            difficult to justify any actions in North Vietnam on the evidence of
                            violations of the 1954 Agreement of South Vietnam. He was not clear as
                            to why he differentiated between the two. I made the point that the
                            South Vietnamese issue appeared of much greater importance in the minds
                            of the American public and the Congress than the Laotian issue.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> seemed to support
                            this position.</p>
                        <p>4. The President, throughout the evening, expressed impatience that we
                            had not reached a conclusion as to the course of action to be followed.
                            He said that he felt that there was little developed throughout the
                            dinner discussion that had not been evident several days or several
                            weeks earlier.</p>
                        <p>5. I stated that I felt we must be extremely careful about action in
                            North Vietnam. I observed that the Chiefs (at least General <persName corresp="#p_LMGCE1">LeMay</persName>) advocated a strike deep into
                            North Vietnam. I pointed out that if this were done it might unleash
                            forces which could readily overcome the friendly forces in both Laos and
                            South Vietnam, with the result that we would “lose our base” in
                            Southeast Asia. This view was supported by Bundy and recognized by the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName>Bundy</persName> pointed out that the most important paper
                            before the President was the estimate prepared by the Board of National
                                Estimates<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">
                                <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 50–2–64, May 25, “Probable
                                Consequences of Certain US Actions with Respect to Vietnam and
                                Laos,” is printed in part in Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, vol. I,
                                pp. 378–380.</note> which in effect said a limited strike against
                            North Vietnam might cause a hesitation on the part of the North
                            Vietnamese in their direction to the Pathet Lao and the Viet Cong,
                            causing them to stand down their operations temporarily while events
                            developed. On the other hand, the estimate pointed out that a
                            large-scale attack might have just the opposite effect, i.e.,
                            intensification of action by the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and also intervention by the North
                            Vietnamese and very possibly the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> insisted, throughout
                            the evening, that any action against North Vietnam must anticipate the
                            commitment of at least seven Divisions in Southeast Asia. That while he
                            did not intend to commit them, he felt that they should be
                            pre-positioned and alerted. In fact, he said, they were already alerted.
                            I took issue with this point, stating that in my opinion, (which was
                            strictly non-professional and not supported by any studies) air attacks
                            would be more decisive than this indicated and possibly conclusive. I
                            furthermore said that if any action involved the <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0145"/>commitment of troops to combat in South
                            Vietnam, we had better forget it because the American people and the
                            Congress would not support such action under any condition. I said that,
                            in my opinion, the American public are fed up with adventures such as
                            the Korean War and would not stand for another one.</p>
                        <p>8. Throughout the evening the President inquired as to whether all
                            possible was being done in South Vietnam. The answer was affirmative and
                            I did not take issue with this. There was some question concerning the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> plan of additional training and
                            also some questions about closer integration of the <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> government and <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. However, the meeting did not deal with these issues
                            to any particular extent.</p>
                        <p>9. The President then summarized the course of action he desired to
                            follow about as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. We should do all possible in South Vietnam. We should review all that
                            is being done in South Vietnam and see that any possible action on our
                            part which might improve the situation is undertaken. A conference
                            should be arranged in Honolulu or elsewhere with <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> to be sure that he is “on board”
                            on everything we wish to do and that no stone is left unturned in
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>, training men,
                            developing plans, etc., which will assist with the effort in South
                            Vietnam. In this connection we should point out that we are handicapped
                            by a cut in foreign aid and foreign military assistance funds by the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>b. We should go to Khrushchev and appeal to him to use his offices to
                            relieve the situation threatening the peace. The United States should be
                            in the position of promoting peace. On the other hand, we would not
                            stand to see a country over-run and imposed upon by its neighbors.</p>
                        <p>c. We should go to the United Nations and make all possible noise
                            advocating peace, telling the world through the United Nations forum of
                            the aggression from North Vietnam. This should be done through the
                            Security Council (not the General Assembly). If a veto is encountered,
                            then we should;</p>
                        <p>d. Go to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, solicit their aid,
                            their assistance and their support.</p>
                        <p>e. If all of the above failed, then we should prepare for action against
                            North Vietnam on carefully selected targets (this term was not defined
                            and the discussion did not turn to exactly what was meant by the term,
                            carefully selected targets). If this involved a positioning of troops
                            and other actions, then we should be prepared to take such actions.</p>
                        <p>10. These were the guidelines laid down for me for my discussion with
                            Eisenhower, with special emphasis on the cut in foreign aid.</p>
                        <p>11. It was agreed that low-level flights over Laos would be authorized to
                            the extent required and requested by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and to the extent of 9 flights per day with a 36-hour
                            lead time on actual authorization from Washington.</p>

                        <p>7706. Following message has been delivered to Prime Minister Home through
                            White House channels:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Begin Text</p>
                        <p>Dear Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>The situation in Laos has reached a critical point. Pathet Lao attacks
                            against forces loyal to the Royal Government continue. Meanwhile, Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna</persName>, in a statement
                            today, announced publicly he has called for consultations in Vientiane
                            under Article Four of the Geneva Declaration, and I am glad to hear that
                            you are having your Charge take the lead in organizing these
                            promptly.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna also makes it clear that the Royal Government of Laos is
                            prepared to attend a conference on Laos, which some signatories of the
                            Geneva Agreements prefer, on condition that a cease-fire be established
                            immediately throughout the country, that the Pathet Lao forces withdraw
                            to the positions they held before the May 17 attacks, that his own
                            powers be fortified and that the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            operate effectively.</p>
                        <p>I believe we must give our unreserved support to Souvanna's position and
                            seek through the Article Four consultations to develop as much further
                            support as possible. Souvanna's conditions are truly minimal unless we
                            are prepared to hold a conference to ratify another Communist grab. From
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName>'s message to Dean
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d63fn2">Dated May 23. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_SS1">S/S</gloss> Presidential/Secretary's Correspondence: Lot 66 D
                                204, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Officials-Sec. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, 1962–1964)</note> I gather
                            that your instructions to Denson call for achieving the objective of (1)
                            an effective cease-fire supervised by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, and (2) some real unity in the Government of Laos, but
                            they apparently do not mention the important matter of Pathet Lao
                            withdrawals.</p>
                        <p>If in fact there is this omission, then I do not believe these
                            instructions go far enough. As Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> himself has put it, we
                            cannot go to a conference faced with a fait accompli to the advantage of
                            the aggressors, and where the latter could use their new territorial
                            gains to argue that they control the whole country. Moreover, seizure of
                            the entire Plain of Jars area by the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese has
                            been aimed at demoralizing and indeed eliminating the Neutralist forces
                            in Laos. Unless a Neutralist position can be restored, <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0147"/> Souvanna's right to speak for his
                            country internationally will be put in question and the whole political
                            basis for the Geneva Agreements undermined. In this connection, we are
                            somewhat puzzled by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName>'s
                            allusion to a Zurich-type meeting. We do not, of course, wish to weaken
                            in any way Souvanna's position as Prime Minister, any more than we can
                            accept the takeover of the Plain of Jars. Souvanna must sit at the
                            conference table as the representative of Laos just as he did at the
                            concluding session of the 1962 conference. He could bring with him
                            representatives of various factions if he wished.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, and to put the matter in more precise terms, I wish to say to
                            you in all frankness that I do not see how the Government of the United
                            States can consider attending a conference on Laos unless (a) there is
                            an effective cease-fire supervised by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>; (b) there is a withdrawal of the Pathet Lao from the
                            positions held by the Neutralists on the Plain of Jars before the recent
                            Pathet Lao attacks; and (c) it is clearly understood that Prince
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> as Prime
                            Minister would represent the Government of Laos at the conference. As
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> has put it in his
                            letter of Friday to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d63fn3">Text in telegram 7679
                                to London, May 22. (Ibid.)</note> any other position would simply
                            not be understood in this country and, “might very well be disastrous
                            for our whole position in Southeast Asia, by finally convincing our
                            friends that we really do not have the will and determination to resist
                            a Communist take-over of the peninsula”.</p>
                        <p>I fully realize that firm adherence to this position may result in sharp
                            disagreement on the Communist side, at least initially. We would then
                            have to consider various additional moves of a military nature. We would
                            expect to consult closely with you on these.</p>
                        <p>I greatly value the close consultation our two governments have had and
                            the parallel actions we have been taking. I hope that we can continue to
                            see these matters eye-to-eye in approaching the Article Four
                            consultations in Vientiane. <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.

                            contain <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s judgment that we
                            could only get the Communist side to withdraw from the Plaine des Jarres
                            by the application of very considerable military force in Laos, and the
                            further fear that, if we and Souvanna should stand firm on the
                            withdrawal conditions, the Communist side may also respond by
                            maintaining attacks and gradually enlarging its area of control.</p>
                        <p>We have all felt that it was unwise or premature, or both, to get into
                            substantial military actions in Laos at this point. Hence, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proposal<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">This
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “Scenario” was prepared by the
                                Bureau of International Organization Affairs, Department of State,
                                and sent to <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> on May
                                26 under cover of a letter from <persName corresp="#p_CJH1">Cleveland</persName>. (Ibid., POL 27 ASIA SE) A copy can also

                            build up additional diplomatic pressure before we go further, with the
                            “go further” contemplated to include measures against North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>However, this may leave us a serious problem of deterring the kind of
                            additional Communist attacks <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            fears. I believe that the only measure that would do so would be a
                            prompt deployment of moderate-sized US and other <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> ground and air forces to Thailand.
                            We would not use these forces in Laos unless the Communists did actually
                            continue to move on a significant scale, but their very presence would
                            indicate that we were considering further measures and could well serve
                            as a warning to the Communists that would hold the situation somewhat in
                            place while we urge Souvanna to take the deadlock on withdrawal to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I therefore recommend that we consult immediately with the Thai in this
                                sense,<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">In telegram 2152 to Bangkok, May
                                27, the Department asked if the Embassy thought Thai attitudes
                                against introduction of U.S. troops had changed and, if not, what
                                could be done to change them. In telegram 2032 from Bangkok, May 28,
                                the Embassy responded that to obtain Thailand's concurrence, Thai
                                leaders had “to be cut pretty fully on scenario” and convinced that
                                contemplated U.S. actions represented effective countermeasures.
                                (Both in Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> and
                            concurrently with the British, Australians, New Zealanders, <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0149"/>and Filipinos. This would involve our
                            making clear that we were contemplating the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> request in order to build up international support and
                            as a prelude to possible additional actions. I do not think, however,
                            that we would need at this point to go through the whole range of
                            possible actions in order to get the key nations to accept this course
                            of action. It must be recognized that the Thai might so insist, but I
                            think in the existing situation we would probably not have to spell it
                            out.</p>
                        <p>The only other way I see to deter continued Communist action in Laos
                            would be to bring the Lao complaint to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at once. However, this would somewhat rush our timing
                            both in the sense of getting our materials together to handle that case
                            effectively, and in the sense that the Lao action is itself part of the
                            broader timetable on which we probably do not wish to act quite as
                            rapidly as this. Therefore, the movement of forces to Thailand becomes a
                            stopping action to enable us to take perhaps ten days or so before we
                            move to the Lao complaint.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday, the Polish Government, obviously with Soviet approval if not
                            on Soviet instruction, suggested a meeting at a neutral site between
                            representatives of the Geneva Co-chairmen, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> member nations, and the three Lao factions. The
                            following are our initial views on the implications of such a meeting
                            for US interests.</p>
                        <p>For this discussion, we assume US interests to be to retain as nearly as
                            possible the Geneva solution—as opposed to some form of partition—with
                            the minimum use of US military force.</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>Such a meeting, to be sure, could become merely a back door to a full
                            Geneva conference. It could also lead the British and the Canadians, now
                            apparently firmly behind Souvanna, and even Souvanna himself into making
                            concessions to achieve at least the appearance of progress. However,
                            these dangers are probably common to any purely political and diplomatic
                            efforts directed toward resolving the problem of Laos. Although its
                            prospects for achieving a successful settlement would be remote, we
                            believe that such a meeting could have certain tactical advantages.
                            These might make it to the interests of the United States to keep the
                            proposal open, assuming it is acceptable to the Lao factions, as an
                            alternative to Article 4 consultations should the latter break down or
                            prove ineffective.</p>
                        <p>We see the tactical advantages of a meeting such as that proposed by the
                            Poles as follows:</p>
                        <p>1) It would give the US another forum in which to work out a solution
                            before going either to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or another
                            14 nation conference. The failure of such a meeting to produce agreement
                            could bolster the argument of the futility of proceeding to Geneva.</p>
                        <p>2) Short of partition or of occupying Lao territory with United States
                            forces, our best hope of keeping a non-communist government in being in
                            Laos remains through some form of agreement, however fragile, among the
                            Lao themselves. It should be remembered that the 1961–62 Geneva
                            Conference could never have reached agreement if the Lao themselves had
                            not agreed at Zurich to form a coalition government under Souvanna and
                            at the Plaine des Jarres on the composition of the cabinet. Therefore,
                            if there is any chance that the Lao might still reach agreement among
                            themselves, we should encourage the chance. If there is no such chance
                            we will at least have established once again that it is the Communist
                            faction alone which refuses to cooperate with the other two, and will be
                            on more solid ground to take further action.</p>
                        <p>3) The closer the United States comes to direct intervention the more
                            disastrous it would be should Souvanna back down. If there is any chance
                            that he will get off the train at some future stop, it should become
                            apparent at such a meeting. If he should back down on his own conditions
                            for a Geneva Conference it would be preferable for him to do it before
                            we have committed United States troops and prestige to the support of
                            these conditions. Such a meeting would test Souvanna's
                            determination.</p>
                        <p>4) Such a meeting would provide a forum for negotiation in the absence of
                            the French, the Chinese Communists and the North Vietnamese. Souvanna's
                            conditions and our continued support for them would have a better chance
                            of being justified and maintained at such a forum than at either a
                            Geneva Conference or the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0151"/>
                        <p>5) Finally, the Polish proposal does not threaten to raise the question
                            of Cambodia or South Vietnam as would a 14 nation conference or a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate.</p>
                        <p>In short, such a meeting would provide optimum conditions for Souvanna to
                            establish his position with the very parties he must deal with sooner or
                            later. In the absence of the French and the Asian Communists, Souvanna
                            would be under less pressure to compromise. And no matter what the
                            outcome, the United States need not be committed to anything Souvanna
                            has not agreed to himself.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Probable Soviet Tactics</p>
                        <p>The main advantage of any Geneva-type conference, in Moscow's view, would
                            be to forestall strong US countermeasures against the communists in
                            Laos. The Russians may see the Polish-proposed meeting simply as a means
                            of easing the West into a full-blown Geneva conference. However, they
                            probably prefer the Polish plan which would get negotiations started in
                            a forum excluding the two major Soviet adversaries, the United States
                            and Communist China.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to predict Soviet tactics with any precision in the
                            absence of reaction from both the Asian communists and from the Lao
                            principals themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Polish proposal suggests that a cease-fire might be an acceptable
                            precondition, but Moscow would probably be unwilling and almost
                            certainly unable to obtain compliance with Souvanna's demands for a
                            Pathet Lao withdrawal from the Plaine des Jarres advances. The Polish
                            statement also proposes that Laos be represented at the meeting by the
                            three factions and does not refer to the Royal Lao Government or to
                            Premier <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. However,
                            Moscow probably would try to work out a compromise formula to
                            accommodate both Souvanna and the Pathet Lao. We believe that Moscow
                            will seek to get the coalition government into operation again as a
                            promising alternative to further polarization with the dangers of
                            all-out war and US involvement. Therefore, the Soviets would support
                            Pathet Lao demands that the neutralist-rightist merger be ended. Moscow
                            probably would not agree to more effective <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> functioning; indeed it might seek to insure that no
                            majority activities could be undertaken in the future.</p>

                            move quite soon into a new phase on its own steam, and for this reason
                            you should know what is being considered even though no decision is
                            called for today.</p>
                        <p>2. In essence, telegram to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            reports results of two long and comprehensive meetings here today in
                            which <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>, and Attorney General have
                            been included with constructive results in all three cases.</p>
                        <p>3. Current proposal is that we should encourage Souvanna to accept a
                            leading role in meeting proposed by Poles of representatives of the
                            International Control Commission, Soviet and British Co-Chairmen, and
                            three Laos factions. Virtue of this forum as against full Geneva
                            conference is omission of French, Chinese Communists, and North
                            Vietnamese. Also some slight tactical advantage to us in our own
                            absence.</p>
                        <p>4. Key point in Souvanna acceptance would be statement that if no
                            satisfactory restoration of situation in Laos emerges from Polish
                            meeting, he would have to ask active foreign assistance and has
                            assurance that U.S. at least would respond.</p>
                        <p>5. Form of our response would be international deployment to Thailand
                            with probable company of British, Australians and Philippines, and
                            readiness to execute air strikes, on Souvanna's request, against
                            Communist supply lines in Laos (moving into North Vietnam only if total
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> picture made it desirable).</p>
                        <p>6. Thus, basic decision which may come to you is authorization of
                            assurance to Souvanna that U.S. would act on this basis if situation in
                            Laos remains unsatisfactory and Polish meeting should fail.</p>
                        <p>7. You will see at once that on this plan U.S. readiness to act in
                            support of Souvanna is key element, both internationally and in terms of
                            your own decision. Reason for thinking in terms of this decision now is
                            that any international meeting with no show of U.S. will is bound to
                            have <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0153"/>gravely weakening effect
                            not only in Laos but in South Vietnam, and so in other countries as
                            well. This is unanimous judgment of both meetings today, including
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and still more
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and the Attorney
                            General.</p>
                        <p>8. Nevertheless, object of this scenario is to move actual use of force
                            with respect to Laos further down the road and to limit it more tightly
                            than any other alternative now apparent. Moreover, even if Polish
                            meeting should fail, this scenario leaves open further appeal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at time of deployment and before any
                            actual strike.</p>
                        <p>9. We repeat that no decision is required tonight or, in all probability,
                            before your return. But because the problem of Laos has been somewhat in
                            the background in your discussions of recent days, we believe it
                            important for you to have this up-to-date report of current thinking
                            here.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There was general feeling that our objective should at minimum be seek
                            prevent further deterioration in Laos and take action directed <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0154"/>toward restoration status quo
                            ante May 16th. Matter viewed not just from standpoint of Laos but also
                            morale effects in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, Thailand and much
                            of underdeveloped world. Also general consensus that no hope of
                            achieving foregoing objectives by negotiation, whatever the forum,
                            without some clear expression of US determination and will that US not
                            willing write off Laos to Communists. While we initially would seek to
                            treat Lao question separate from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>-NVN
                            problem, if satisfactory Lao solution not achieved basis should have
                            been laid for possible subsequent actions that would permit our dealing
                            more effectively with NVN with respect both <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and Laos.</p>
                        <p>Against foregoing background, we felt initial step should be acceptance
                            of appropriately modified or interpreted Polish proposal (full text
                            being transmitted by <gloss target="#t_septel1">septel</gloss>)<note n="5" xml:id="d67fn5">Transmitted in <gloss target="#t_Tosec1">Tosec</gloss> 37 to Bangkok, May 29. (Ibid.)</note> accompanied
                            by firm assurance from us to Souvanna that we would be prepared to give
                            him prompt and direct military support if the Polish conference was not
                            successful.</p>
                        <p>We recognize that, before making such commitment to Souvanna, it would be
                            necessary for us to obtain agreement of Thailand. However, we assume
                            that, under circumstances outlined herein, this could be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to views set forth Circular 2209,<note n="6" xml:id="d67fn6">Dated May 27. (Ibid.)</note> which was not given seventh floor
                            clearance, we now feel that Polish proposal probably offers best initial
                            forum to seek to work out solution. It would:</p>
                        <p>1. Provide alternative to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (where, in
                            absence French support, we would probably be unable harness seven votes
                            for useful proposition in Security Council) or another fourteen-nation
                            conference. US support of such a meeting would be additional (and least
                            damaging in terms <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and Thai
                            interests) demonstration our willingness seek peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p>2. Short of partition or US occupation Lao territory, our best hope of
                            keeping some non-Communist Government in being in Laos remains through
                            some form of agreement, however fragile, among the Lao themselves. If
                            Lao not able reach agreement, we will at least have established once
                            again that Communist faction alone refuses to cooperate with other two
                            and we will be on more solid ground take further action.</p>
                        <p>3. Such a meeting would provide forum for negotiation without French,
                            Chinese Communists, or North Vietnamese. Souvanna's conditions and our
                            continued support for them would have better chance of being justified
                            and maintained in such a forum than at either the fourteen-nation Geneva
                            conference or the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0155"/>
                        <p>4. Polish proposal does not threaten to raise question of Cambodia or
                            South Viet-Nam as would fourteen-nation conference or UN debate, and
                            should minimize problems in SVN of any conference on Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. Souvanna could go to such a conference without abandoning, and in fact
                            he should not abandon, his preconditions for any fourteen-nation
                            conference. Essential to acceptability of Polish proposal is recognition
                            of Souvanna Phouma's position as Prime Minister of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. Polish formula appears leave room for
                            negotiation on this point.</p>
                        <p>6. By providing a forum which includes Soviets but excludes ChiComs, such
                            a conference keeps Soviets seized of Laos problem in context most useful
                            to our interests.</p>
                        <p>To carry out foregoing, we would envision scenario along following
                            lines:</p>
                        <p>1. Begin discussions with Souvanna, Thais, French, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Assuming outcome of foregoing discussions favorable, Souvanna would
                            undertake, with our support, discussions with Poles to obtain whatever
                            reformulation or interpretation of their proposal may be required to
                            obtain recognition Souvanna would be attending such a conference as PM
                            of Government of National Union and sole spokesman for that Government.
                            Representatives of other two factions would be attending solely as
                            representatives of those factions.</p>
                        <p>3. Subject to satisfactory outcome foregoing, Souvanna would accept
                            participation in Polish conference while maintaining his present
                            preconditions for participation in any fourteen-nation conference.</p>
                        <p>4. In agreeing to attend conference, Souvanna would seek to improve
                            bargaining position by making it clear, publicly or privately, in manner
                            agreed with us and Thai Government, that, in event conference not
                            successful, US would provide prompt and direct military support along
                            lines described para 6 below. (Study being given here to question of
                            Congressional consultation or approval of such future US force
                            commitments, taking account of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            obligations.)</p>
                        <p>5. Souvanna would at same time request assistance of US (and possibly
                            others) in reequipping his forces and we would immediately initiate such
                            resupply through present channels.</p>
                        <p>6. If Polish conference not successful or in meanwhile Pathet Lao/Viet
                            Minh significantly advance toward Mekong from present positions, we
                            would, in response to Souvanna request, immediately deploy to Thailand
                            an international force and initiate selective air strikes against Pathet
                            Lao/Viet Minh supply lines and installations. (Note: We would not
                            attempt at this time exactly to define what would be an acceptable
                            degree of “success” but at minimum feel it would require reestablishment
                            of some Kong Le presence in Plaine des Jarres. Whether such air strikes
                            would at least initially be confined to Laos or include targets in <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0156"/>North Viet-Nam would be
                            determined at the time in the light of developments in the total
                            Southeast Asia scenario.)</p>
                        <p>7. At the time of deployment to Thailand, accompanying Security Council
                            action would be taken by Souvanna and/or ourselves in which our position
                            would be that we were prepared to yield in favor of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if and when the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reached agreement on appropriate measures to restore the
                            situation. Decision would have to be made at the time with respect to
                            exact time relationship between <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> moves
                            (by Souvanna as well as ourselves) and our military moves.<note n="7" xml:id="d67fn7">Printed from an unsigned copy.</note>

                        <p>Secto 23. Had one hour talk with Kosygin at Soviet Embassy accompanied by
                            Bowles. Soviet Ambassador and one Soviet FonOff official also
                            present.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows a brief account of trade discussions.]</p>
                        <p>We then turned to Laos at my request. I went over background of
                                Khrushchev-<persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> agreement
                            of June 1961 and Geneva Accords of 1962. I described two major Viet Minh
                            violations throughout subsequent period, namely, continued presence Viet
                            Minh military in Laos and use of Laos as corridor to attack South Viet
                            Nam. I told him we and Soviet had agreed that everyone should leave Laos
                            alone and that, if left alone, Laos would cause no problems for its
                            neighbors. Neither side needed Laos as an ally. I said that, on the one
                            side, the United States has no interest in military bases or a military
                            presence in Southeast Asia and that if Hanoi and Peiping would leave
                            their neighbors alone there could be peace in Southeast Asia. On other
                            hand, I said that we could not stand aside and watch <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0157"/>Southeast Asia be overrun by Hanoi and
                            Peiping. I concluded by urging importance of close cooperation between
                            Washington and Moscow to support full compliance with Geneva Accords of
                            1962.</p>
                        <p>Time began to run out because both of us had to attend and speak at Delhi
                            memorial meeting for Nehru. Kosygin, however, said that he would report
                            my observations to Mr. Khrushchev, declared that Soviet Union fully
                            supports Geneva Accords, but stated that US was taking military steps
                            which would provide no answer to situation. I told him that we are not
                            seeking a military solution but that Pathet Lao with help of several
                            Viet Minh battalions were resorting to military action contrary to the
                            Accords. I told him growing danger of situation made it all the more
                            important for our two governments to act together to preserve Geneva
                            Accords.</p>
                        <p>Atmosphere of conversation was relaxed throughout except for two or three
                            sentence exchange over our actions in South Viet Nam. No threats were
                            used by either side. Since time was very short I do not believe this
                            conversation substitutes for more systematic exchange of views with them
                            on Laos at highest level.</p>

                            and Australia feel that their ground forces are tied up in Borneo; might

                            forces in Thailand if put US into Lao towns. SecDef said it would
                            require substantial deployments to Thailand. Further, any action against
                            NVN would have to precede by substantial US deployments. Felt said it
                            would be enough to be ready to send such US troops; the communists are
                            “yellow” and will back down if <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0159"/>the brigades are deployed to the Mekong towns. <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said this gets us to Hanoi by

                            “Punitive air strikes in support of the Laotian situation.” He said
                            there are four fixed targets in the north, and 3 in the Panhandle (only
                            good ones, Ban Ban and Khang Khay in the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>). <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> identified 17
                            bridges. Also 5 sod-type airfields, as potential targets if air resupply
                            used. So very few attractive fixed targets. Armed reconnaissance,
                            though, might provide something to attack (those who shoot at you).</p>
                        <p>SecDef pointed out that nothing mentioned so far will stop flow into
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> (e.g., 6 people a day, and
                            equipment moving at night). It has psychological effect and is an
                            escalating move but little physical impact. SecState said the same
                            pertained to China targets during Korea, which led to conclusion that
                            Chinese will would be affected only by striking Chinese cities! Felt
                            distinguished the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> case, where no
                            massive invasion. You can throttle down the flow of stuff (not stop it).

                            supplies to Delta and to High Plateau. <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said that it would provide action for us, where
                            we really can't retake the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>. Felt
                            thinks a package of actions might cause Lao to be more active. SecDef
                            asked whether we wouldn't have to increase US presence in Laos first
                            (White Star teams, MAAG, etc.) to guard against <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> moves. <persName>Bundy</persName> didn't think anything
                            like that we did would make much difference on short term. Felt said
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> are encadred by Viet Minh; we
                            might encadre the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>. Have done it to
                            some extent with Thai. Lao don't like it. Chadbourn concurred, but said

                        <p>SecDef said he would oppose putting US troops into Mekong without some US
                            military stiffening of Lao (White Star and encadrement) and way of
                            knowing what goes on.</p>

                            Don't need tanks replaced. Issue was trucks and 105s. They are “on the

                        <p>SecState asked whether Souvanna would go to Paris if shooting began.
                            Chadbourn said probably yes.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> asked if Felt is happy

                        <p>SecState doubted value of recce. (They will hide and travel at

                        <p>SecDef asked what if Souvanna left. Chadbourn said he might stick around.
                            He has said he would not preside over a war. He has not asked for
                            strikes in Laos, or even for US pilots. He thinks strikes against NVN
                                <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0160"/>are right and would put an
                            end to the trouble. Souvanna, if he left, would probably be succeeded by

                        <p>SecDef said that if we moved into Mekong towns, Thais would be with us.
                            SecState said that a <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>-type operation
                            from Laos into Thailand would be very difficult to handle. Felt said
                            occupation of the towns would go with pressures elsewhere on NVN.</p>

                                    Forrestal suggested that Laos was the place for the United

                        <p>At the moment Article 4 consultations among five of the fourteen Geneva
                            nations are taking place. These will not amount to a hill of beans. The
                            next probable step will be something like the Polish proposal, modified
                            so that this meeting will take place in Luang Prabang instead of Geneva
                            and will include <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>,
                            as well as representatives of the three factions. There will be two
                            principal issues: restoration of the Government of National Union and
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> withdrawal from the Plaine des
                            Jarres. This meeting will fail to produce any agreement; but it will
                            probably produce intense pressure for a fourteen-nation Geneva
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>We should take an intensely firm decision (probably by the President) not
                            to attend the Geneva Conference. We should repeat this decision
                            incessantly to our friends and enemies. Simultaneously, we should expand
                            our air reconnaissance activities to include all those areas both in <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0161"/>Laos and North Vietnam through
                            which Hanoi's supply lines run into each of those countries. I
                            understand (contrary to my previous expectations) that significant
                            results are already being achieved. The purpose of the reconnaissance is
                            not only to give a signal of our determination, but also to provide
                            evidence for use before Congress and later the world.</p>
                        <p>Some of our planes will get shot at; some may even be lost. Hopefully,
                            this will not start happening for some time, when we may be in a
                            position to take advantage of this to begin moving down a more serious
                            tack. This is very sketchy, but I think we must get a start on a
                            combined military/political tack in Laos.<note n="3" xml:id="d70fn3">In

                            For the moment, we are doing quite well in our negotiations with and on
                            behalf of Souvanna, and our relatively affirmative position on the
                            Polish proposal has been helpful, but it is agreed that we need to
                            discuss possible further actions with respect to Laos, both among
                            ourselves and with the Thais, the British, and the French.” (Ibid.,

                                June.<note n="2" xml:id="d71fn2">See <ref target="#d73fn1">footnote

                            developing a comprehensive public information program and Assistant
                            Secretary <persName>Bundy</persName> took on the job of drafting a
                            Congressional resolution on Southeast Asia. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> suggested that the
                            following meeting discuss where we stand, develop the problems of Laos,
                            cover the actions to be taken in Vietnam, mention the fact of the need
                            for a public information program and go over a checklist of the range of
                            military choices.</p>
                        <p>2. With respect to Laos, it was accepted that the value of the Lao
                            situation is that we have a positive position, although we are not apt
                            to regain any geography. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> suggested that we stick to Souvanna Phouma's
                            precondition of Pathet Lao withdrawal, and take certain steps to
                            indicate strength. We should divide our potential actions into
                            pre-impasse and post-impasse actions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that we do not wish to take military
                            action soon but that we should do more than talk. He suggested that an
                            impasse or a breakdown of the coalition government of Laos might occur
                            any time and would call for stronger effort. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> also indicated the
                            importance of initiating some planning for actions on the Mekong with
                            the Thai, at least on a hypothetical basis.</p>
                        <p>3. A discussion then took place of specific actions in the attached list
                            with respect to Laos, with a selection among them as to various things
                            to be done in a pre-impasse period. Few of these were selected as most
                            were postponed for the impasse period. During the conversation the point
                            was made that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> hoped for somewhat
                            looser restrictions on its covert operations to build strength within
                            Laos; this was generally accepted. The measures to be recommended were
                            to be summarized by Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> in a separate paper
                            the next day.</p>
                        <p>4. A discussion of the steps to be taken after an impasse brought up the
                            problem of how we can keep from going to Geneva. Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> opined that this depends largely on
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, although the
                            Thai and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> will probably refuse to go.
                            It was noted that the President wants a massive diplomatic effort to
                            settle the problems in Indo China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and others believed that it might be necessary
                            to give some assurances to <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> of military action and to actually take some
                            military steps in addition. The DCI commented on the difficulty of
                            taking U.S. military action, and also whether it would be effective in
                            holding back the Communists or keeping us from Geneva in the light of
                            the pressures upon us to go there. It was also noted that Souvanna might
                            be overthrown by the rightists if he started to go to Geneva. Various
                                <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0163"/>actions were then discussed
                            for possible application after an impasse and these will be included in
                            Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>'s memorandum above.</p>

                                1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">Not found.</note> subject as above,
                            which requested views on the possible use of Thai Special Forces in
                            Laos, with particular attention to whether they could be employed
                            fruitfully and taking into consideration other current operations in
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. Except for a modest overt military assistance program and the
                            small-scale cross-border operations from South Vietnam into Laos which
                            were recently authorized, the paramilitary operations in Laos are under
                            the operational direction of the Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>). These programs are:</p>
                        <p>a. Operation Hardnose, which is a covert program primarily designed to
                            develop intelligence of Viet Cong/Pathet Lao activity in Central and
                            Southern Laos utilizing indigenous Lao and Kha tribesmen.</p>

                        <p>b. A covert program designed to support tribal elements engaged in
                            village defense and guerrilla activities against the Pathet Lao. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>3. Certain of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s operations
                            plans provide for the utilization of Royal Thai Army (<gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss>) Special Forces along with other local
                            national and Allied forces. In this event, such forces would be employed
                            as part of a larger Allied military effort.</p>
                        <p>4. [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] the
                                <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> Special Forces could be used as
                            cadre and trainers for <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and
                            Neutralist regular Lao units. However, such use of Thai Special Forces
                            at this time would probably create major problems in coordination and
                            control. In addition, current training deficiencies of the Thai Special
                            Forces make it unlikely that their use would be effective at this time.
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has the capability to
                            provide the training necessary to improve their effectiveness for either
                            overt or covert employment.</p>
                        <p>5. In view of the foregoing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that
                                <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> Special Forces should not be
                            employed at the present time in Laos. They recommend Foreign Minister
                            Thanat be informed that the United States can provide training for
                                <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> Special Forces. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has been instructed to arrange
                            for a mobile training team to conduct such training as soon as he is
                            requested to do so by the Royal Thai Government through the Joint US
                            Military Advisory Group, Thailand.</p>

                        <p rend="center"> LAOS </p>
                        <p>The enemy has two choices in Laos, each with a number of shadings.</p>
                        <p>First, he can at any time initiate substantial military action on the
                            ground aiming toward the Mekong Valley.</p>
                        <p>Second, he can try to keep what he has for the present and leave any
                            military initiative to us. This is our major problem.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Action if the enemy moves strongly toward the
                            Mekong.</p>
                        <p>While we rate its likelihood very low (less than one in ten) we must
                            obviously be prepared for this first case—substantial enemy pressure
                            toward the Mekong. In this case we believe that it would be necessary to
                            be prepared to move U.S. and other forces into Thailand at once and to
                            be prepared, with the Thais, to occupy selected Laotian cities on the
                            left bank of the Mekong. This of course would imply a still sharper de
                            facto partition of Laos, but since it would by definition be a response
                            to clear-cut Communist military aggression, we believe it would be
                            internationally and nationally acceptable—and indeed almost
                            inevitable.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation 1</p>
                        <p>Our recommendation is that contingency planning against this possibility
                            should be undertaken at once with Thailand, and we believe that military
                            discussions of this contingency will have a useful diplomatic effect in
                            Thailand, Laos and North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Politico-Military Scenario if there is no
                            further major Communist movement in Laos.</p>
                        <p>The second enemy choice poses us a more complicated problem. In essence
                            our objectives are three:</p>
                        <p>(1) not to let the situation develop so rapidly that we are faced with a
                            choice of humiliation or major military action before we are ready to
                            take decisions in the context of <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and
                            especially <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0167"/>
                        <p>(2) not to lose whatever prospect there is of maintaining a Souvanna
                            government and at least a nominal maintenance of the political status
                            quo in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(3) not to permit a diplomatic “victory” for neutralism and Communism
                            which would reflect heavily against our position and that of our friends
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and elsewhere in Southeast
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>Our belief is that the following politico-military scenario is the best
                            available for these purposes. By a minimum of force, and an absence of
                            direct hostile action unless they shoot first, it aims to show</p>
                        <p>(1) Our determination</p>
                        <p>(2) Our readiness for peace</p>
                        <p>(3) More specifically, our continued dedication to the Geneva Accords and
                            especially to the Souvanna government.</p>
                        <p>1. The Article IV consultations. These are proceeding in Vientiane now
                            and we should do our best to string them out and to wring out of them a
                            sharp picture of Pathet Lao aggression in the Plain of Jars. The Article
                            IV consultations are limited to our friends and include neither French
                            nor Communist representation. They have their value and it should not be
                            we who bring them to an end. But already pressure is very high for the
                            next step which is likely to be the Polish Proposal.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation 2</p>
                        <p>We recommend continuation of the consultations in Vientiane, exploitation
                            of the evidence they produce, and readiness to move to the Polish
                            proposals at the latest workable time.</p>
                        <p>At this stage our military pressure consists of fairly regular
                            reconnaissance flights over the Plain of Jars and over Southern Laos,
                            together with high-level <gloss target="#t_U21">U–2</gloss>
                            reconnaissance over North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation 3</p>
                        <p>We recommend that these programs continue.</p>
                        <p>2. The Polish Meeting. We are in favor of the Polish proposal for
                            discussion among the British and Soviet Co-Chairmen, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> Members (Canada, India and Poland), and
                            representatives of the three parties in Laos.</p>
                        <p>It remains our position that the pre-conditions for any Geneva conference
                            are as stated by Souvanna—cease-fire and withdrawal to previous
                            positions, acceptance of Souvanna's position and powers,
                            re-establishment of the Souvanna government of National Unity, and
                            effective functioning of the International Control Commission. We must
                            hold this stand strongly, less for the sake of our own prestige than for
                            the protection of Souvanna's position vis-a-vis his Right Wing, and the
                            position of the <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>
                            government in South Vietnam. We do not suppose that these conditions
                            will be accepted in toto, but we do not at all exclude the possibility
                            of real progress toward them if we follow the program set out below.</p>
                        <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>In one form or another the Polish discussions are likely to occur within
                            the next week or two. Under proper conditions these meetings can be
                            useful in gaining time. Nevertheless, it is most unlikely that these
                            discussions will produce any substantial result, and when they reach an
                            impasse, there will be stronger calls than ever for a new Geneva
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>We therefore believe it important that the Polish meetings be accompanied
                            by additional military signals on our side to underline our
                            determination to insist on a certain degree of Communist pull-back
                            before a Geneva meeting is held.</p>
                        <p>The best available military indicator for this purpose is the extension
                            of present U.S. low-level reconnaissance over Laos into North Vietnam
                            along supply lines feeding the Plain of Jars and the Laotian corridor
                            toward South Vietnam.</p>

                            recommended to this point are those which would occur before an impasse
                            in the Polish discussions. When such an impasse has been reached, we
                            expect to recommend selections from the following additional actions to
                            strengthen our general position. No specific decisions are recommended
                            at present, but such actions might include the following:</p>
                        <p>(1) The expansion of <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations in
                            Laos, including the use of third country pilots, but not Americans.</p>
                        <p>(2) The introduction of harassing action by South Vietnamese forces into
                            the Laotian Corridor (with U.S. advisors).</p>
                        <p>(3) The authorization of South Vietnamese air strikes against North
                            Vietnamese activities in the Laotian corridor.</p>
                        <p>(4) A number of movements of U.S. forces from our West Coast toward the
                            West Pacific in ways that will increase our readiness posture and give a
                            general warning signal. These movements might be selected from among the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>a. 1 Army Brigade to Philippines from Hawaii (5 to 12 days)</p>
                        <p>b. 1 Army Brigade to Okinawa from Hawaii (5 to 12 days)</p>
                        <p>c. Reassign carrier task force from Pacific Coast to South China Sea (2
                            weeks)</p>
                        <p>d. 10 fighter squadrons CONUS to Philippines or WestPac (2 to 10
                            days)</p>
                        <p>e. 1 Marine Division and Air Wing (22,900 men) CONUS to Okinawa (40
                            days)</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">4. Political steps after a Polish impasse.</p>
                        <p>Our present belief is that after an impasse is reached in the Polish
                            discussions, the next step politically should probably be discussion in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Such discussion need not
                            necessarily be limited to Laos, and at this stage we might well wish a
                            general discussion of the threats to peace in Southeast Asia in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forum.</p>
                        <p>We believe it important to have in reserve additional military
                            deployments, warning of which might properly be given in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate. It is possible that on further
                            discussion some of the actions listed above might be withheld for this
                            purpose, but our preliminary thinking has been that the most valuable
                            item in this context would be the deployment of U.S. ground forces, of
                            about 5,000 men to Thailand.</p>
                        <p>It is our current belief that this general politico-military scenario
                            could be expected to last about a month to six weeks, and that at the
                            end of that time further action should be closely related to our wider
                            planning for South Vietnam and Southeast Asia as a whole.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. The Special Problem of the Laotian Right</p>
                        <p>One continuing danger, in all our Laotian efforts, is the Right Wing.
                            Both the relatively skillful <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and the quite unpredictable <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> are capable of acting to overthrow
                            Souvanna and take power at Vientiane at any time. De facto, they have
                            much power there now. Any Right Wing takeover would be most destructive
                            to our whole position.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation 6</p>
                        <p>We recommend that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            continue to use all appropriate diplomatic pressures to prevent any such
                            takeover, including the specific warning that the U.S. would not support
                            those executing such a coup. At the same time, we must avoid as far as
                            possible action which might trigger such a Right Wing reaction. This is
                            one important reason for keeping the finger of accusation pointed at the
                            Communists and avoiding a Geneva conference which tacitly accepts the
                            status quo in the Plain of Jars.</p>

                            the paper on Viet-Nam3 with his comments.</p>
                        <p>The Laos paper accurately describes the discussion in the Executive
                            Committee yesterday.<note n="5" xml:id="d74fn5">See <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note> You may wish to make the following
                            additional points:</p>
                        <p>1. At the bottom of page 2,<note n="6" xml:id="d74fn6">Reference is to
                                paragraph 2 under Recommendation 3.</note> you might note that the
                            failure of the British to consult Souvanna may give us an immediate
                            problem in Laos with Souvanna and especially the right. (We are drafting
                            a long cable to <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> so that he
                            will do all he can to ease this.)</p>
                        <p>2. In the middle of page 3, as to military actions in the “pre-impasse”
                            period, no mention is made of continuing and perhaps modestly extending
                                <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations and also reequipping
                            Lao forces.<note n="7" xml:id="d74fn7">Apparent reference to the last
                                paragraph in Recommendation 3.</note> These are modest measures but
                            they might at least be noted.</p>
                        <p>3. In the discussion of the “impasse” situation no mention is made of the
                            possibility that Souvanna might himself make things extremely difficult
                            for us at this point by yielding on the preconditions and accepting a
                            Geneva conference. We can hope that our firmness and <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s persuasiveness would keep him
                            from doing this, but the President should perhaps be aware that the
                            situation could slide off very rapidly at this point. In our Excom
                            discussion, we all recognized this danger and the possibility that it
                            might virtually de-fuse the whole Lao situation as an aspect of any
                            wider action we might decide on over the summer.</p>
                        <p>4. The impasse situation might also produce a Communist declaration that
                            they were forming their own government in Laos. This would indeed be a
                            de facto partition, and we might then need to consider not only the
                            various military steps discussed under paragraph 3 but also such steps
                            within Laos, if Souvanna requested them, as reinstating the <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0171"/>MAAG and putting substantial advisers
                            into Lao units. The military effect of such steps would be modest but
                            they would be a further sign that we were not prepared to stand for any
                            Communist military action.</p>

                        <p>1. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested that
                            plans be prepared for low level reconnaissance flights over North
                            Vietnam to precede the convening of the Polish sponsored conference now
                            possibly coming up on 23 June.</p>
                        <p>2. The meeting then discussed the attached agenda<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">Not found attached.</note> and its attached outlines
                            of action.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">Apparent reference to <ref target="#d73">Document 73</ref>.</note>

                                Bundy</persName>), the fact that the U.S. forces do not seem to be
                            needed in the absence of a further Pathet Lao push (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>) and that no
                            Congressional resolution is envisaged which would warrant such an
                            assurance for the time being (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> pointed out that it might be desirable to send
                            troops into Thailand on an exercise at least or to give such assurances
                            if the pressure on <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> to go to Geneva grows, in which case at least air
                            units might be sent to Thailand. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> indicated interest in how the scenario could be
                            brought around to bring attention to the corridor to South Vietnam. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> thought there
                            was time for this as we are not apt to immobilize our efforts in the
                            corridor area in any case by any settlement. The Attorney General
                            commented that there seemed to be very little going on in the early
                            stages of this effort, followed by a large jump as an impasse was
                            reached. He suggested that it might be desirable to do more earlier.
                            Both Mr. <persName>William</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge</persName>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> replied that we are deliberately moving the
                            whole operation quite slowly. Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> commented that Siho is a distinct weakness in
                            our armor and would like to know what is being done about eliminating
                            him from the scene. No definite answers were given in view of Siho's
                            strong position in Vientiane. Governor Harriman also assumed that we
                            would continue with our program of supply of equipment, etc; this was
                            confirmed.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion of Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>4. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> suggested
                            particular attention to the Lao recommendations on low level
                            reconnaissance and fighter escort over North Vietnam. There was no
                            dissent from these. With respect to the idea of a Polish conference,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> expressed interest
                            in the prospect that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Poles
                            might use such a forum to indicate some support of the Geneva
                            Agreements. The Attorney General suggested that a more vigorous U.S.
                            posture might be useful to the USSR and Poles in order to hold back the
                            somewhat more aggressive <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. The meeting then broke up as the President was understood not to be
                            available. After some intervening discussion, however, he arrived and
                            the Cabinet members remained with him.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reported that
                            an <gloss target="#t_RF8Crusader1">RF–8</gloss> jet reconnaissance plane
                            from the USS Kitty Hawk had been shot down by antiaircraft fire
                            approximately six miles from the town of Ban Ban in the Plaine des
                            Jarres. The pilot was observed to have parachuted to the ground and was
                            surrounded by Pathet Lao troops. Rescue attempts have been made but have
                            not been successful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reported his
                            own recommendation and that of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that aerial
                            reconnaissance be conducted tomorrow. A single flight plan was
                            recommended, to be carried out by two reconnaissance aircraft, escorted
                            by six to eight fighter bombers, with instructions to return any ground
                            fire.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LMGCE1">LeMay</persName> and General Greene
                            stated that they had personally recommended that the antiaircraft unit
                            which had fired upon the downed aircraft be attacked but both concurred
                            in the recommendations of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of State
                            [Defense]. Both were certain that future reconnaissance planes would be
                            subject to ground fire.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said we should
                            wait for further ground fire before hitting antiaircraft positions. All
                            the military officers, the Secretary of Defense, and the Deputy
                            Secretary of Defense agreed that it was important militarily to continue
                            reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed that
                            reconnaissance should be continued with armed escorts who would return
                            ground fire; but that such reconnaissance should be limited strictly to
                            what is militarily required, and should be scheduled in accordance with
                            real needs. The Secretary of State further wanted an opportunity to
                            obtain, during the day, <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>'s concurrence in the recommended action, to which
                            the Secretary of Defense agreed.<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">In telegram
                                1138 to Vientiane, June 6, the Department informed the Embassy of
                                the decision to conduct a single reconnaissance flight of 2 aircraft
                                on June 7 with 6–8 fighter-bomber escorts able to respond if the
                                reconnaissance planes were fired upon. The Department instructed the
                                Embassy to explain to Souvanna that this action was needed to offset
                                the psychological effect of the shooting down of the U.S. plane and
                                to demonstrate U.S. will, and that Souvanna need not specifically
                                request the armed reconnaissance; he need merely acquiesce.

                        <p>The President inquired what had been the results of previous
                            reconnaissance. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that reconnaissance had shown the
                            location of antiaircraft sites, troop dispositions and movements, supply
                            routes and depots, and the movement of numbers of trucks down these
                            routes. Night reconnaissance had also disclosed a significant increase
                            of night movement on the supply routes from North Vietnam into Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State agreed with the Secretary of Defense that
                            reconnaissance had also had a political effect and may have prevented
                            the complete breakdown of the Government of National Union.</p>

                        <p>1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reported on
                            the shoot-down of a Navy reconnaissance plane, the fact that the pilot
                            was observed parachuting and had sent out radio signals and he had
                            landed in an area infected with Pathet Lao. Efforts to retrieve him had
                            failed and had been ordered stopped because of darkness. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then recommended that a
                            reconnaissance mission of two planes be sent out tomorrow, that it be
                            accompanied by 8 fighter bombers, with orders to return fire if the
                            reconnaissance planes were attacked.</p>
                        <p>2. The President then asked the opinion of each of the Chiefs. All
                            expressed agreement with <persName corresp="#p_LMGCE1">LeMay</persName>
                            and Greene, favoring fighter-bomber operations prior to the
                            reconnaissance flight. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                            and MacDonald were studying the Secretary's recommendation. The
                            differing views were reconciled along the lines of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommendation.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then was asked his views.
                            He said that he felt the reconnaissance flights had been a deterrent to
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> operations, that they should be
                            continued to the extent “necessary and essential in developing
                            photographic reconnaissance required by the situation”. He opposed
                            excessive flights and he opposed “loitering” to gain visual observation
                            of villages, encampments, etc. With this restriction, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> agreed to the reconnaissance flight
                            tomorrow with fighter-bomber accompaniment and orders to return
                            fire.</p>
                        <p>4. The President then said that he questioned whether we had thought
                            through where we are going; specifically he said, “and what comes next?”
                            This question—the most important question raised in the meeting—remained
                            unanswered.</p>
                        <p>5. The President then asked my opinion. I stated that it was probably
                            true that the reconnaissance flights had caused the Pathet Lao North
                            Vietnamese to act with restraint. However I noted their limited time for
                            military actions which involved going forward aggressively for a short
                            period, pausing and then withdrawing was typical of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> operations and probably due more to
                            logistic and support problems, ammunition shortages, etc., than to such
                            considerations as our overflights. With respect to the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommendations, I supported
                            them without hesitation or reservation.</p>
                        <p>6. The Attorney General likewise supported the recommendations.</p>
                        <p>7. The meeting adjourned.</p>
                        <p>I then met briefly with <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName>
                            and asked if he had researched the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Agreement<note n="3" xml:id="d77fn3">The Southeast

                                Documents, 1950–1955, pp. 912–916.</note> and the extent to which we
                            could lean on it if we <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0176"/>wished
                            it to commit actual war. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> agreed to review the Treaty and the
                            obligations over the weekend.</p>
                        <p>I then met privately with <persName>Bundy</persName> and posed the same
                            question to him. I said that the problems of securing a Joint Resolution
                            were most serious as it would involve a debate on the Floor of the
                            Senate which would probably be violent and corrosive to U.S. policy
                            position. However in my opinion the commitment of ground troops to Laos
                            would cause consternation throughout the country and the debate on the
                            Hill infinitely more violent than the one that might arise over a Joint
                            Resolution as outlined by the Attorney General. I said it would surprise
                            me if several important Senators such as Russell and Saltonstall would
                            not severely criticize the commitment of troops to Laos and that I felt
                            a sampling of public opinion at this time would indicate that not one
                            person in 50 favored such commitment. I pointed out that all of the
                            “hardboiled spokesmen” such as Goldwater, Nixon, Rockefeller (to a
                            lesser extent), and even <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Symington</persName>
                            had advocated air strikes and envisaged our boys flying back to base in
                            safety after having deposited their bombs on North Vietnam or elsewhere.
                            I therefore viewed with great concern the consequences of the actions
                            which we were “drifting into” and I wished Bundy to express this view to
                            the President. <persName>Bundy</persName> agreed to give the President a
                            brief memorandum.<note n="4" xml:id="d77fn4">Not further

                        <p>1144. Our exchanges with you today have of course related to <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> missions. We have held off in
                            authorizing any further Tchepone missions until we have decided on
                            policy about escort.</p>
                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0177"/>
                        <p>Defense Dept. view is that Tchepone operations should not continue
                            without escort. However, we recognize that such escort would involve
                            possible firing on targets in eastern Laos in areas where Souvanna has
                            never appealed for our reconnaissance and where Hanoi has made no
                            complaint nor have we ourselves acknowledged them. International defense
                            these flights can be made on grounds infiltration violates Geneva
                            Accords, but case clearly more difficult in absence Souvanna
                            request.</p>
                        <p>We can take more time on this decision than over questions of continuing
                            and escorting <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> flights. However, we
                            need your judgment by Monday whether you believe Souvanna is in fact
                            aware that we are conducting the Tchepone area flights and how he would
                            feel about escort for them.<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">In telegram 1548

                                stated that there was no mandate from Souvanna to reconnoiter the

                                that Souvanna would not agree to it, nor to armed escorts. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> recommended “quietly

                            these flights have encountered very little reaction and that only one

                            Communists and perhaps Souvanna treating this area as almost a no-man's
                            land where rules need not be quite so strict as elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>I have spoken with <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">Mac Bundy</persName> on
                            the telephone. He has the following thoughts about the Laos problem:</p>
                        <p>1. He feels we have not been figuring the odds of accidents over the
                            Plain of Jars very carefully.</p>
                        <p>2. We should not feel rushed into counter-action by the strong desire to
                            hit back. We should instead calculate very carefully and very
                            professionally just when and how to make a strike that will really take
                            out one of the offending anti-aircraft batteries. If that takes a day or
                            two—O.K. We know we have the will to do it, so we don't have to prove
                            our determination to ourselves. The enemy will be more impressed by an
                            effective strike than by one that is not reasonably sure of success.</p>
                        <p>3. We ought not to push this into a faster escalation than we have
                            planned at this stage. In other words we ought to confine our actions to
                            the places where the incidents occurred.</p>
                        <p>4. Mac will be standing by to come down from Boston whenever you feel his
                            presence here would help you. I plan to call him after the meeting this

                        </p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense proposed that another flight of two
                            reconnaissance planes, accompanied by between 6 and 8 escorts, follow a
                            maximum safety route to the vicinity of Xieng Khouang Ville. The escort
                            planes would strike a fortification in this area in which aircraft
                            batteries have been identified by photographic reconnaissance.
                            Immediately following the strike, the photo reconnaissance planes would
                            follow, taking additional pictures, and would then exit from Laos by the
                            safest route. The Secretary of Defense said he would prefer that this
                            action take place tomorrow, but understood that the Department of State
                            wished to delay it 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and
                            Assistant Secretary <persName>Bundy</persName> explained that they did
                            not wish to increase the pace of escalation and particularly wanted to
                            avoid interfering with discussions about the Polish proposal which were
                            currently going on in London and Moscow. They asked, therefore, for a
                            24-hour delay. The Secretary of Defense agreed.</p>
                        <p>A proposed press statement prepared by the Department of Defense was also
                            reviewed at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of Defense proposed that on June 10 a carrier task force
                            from the First Fleet be transferred to the Seventh Fleet and that a
                            public announcement of this fact be made.</p>
                        <p>The President approved the escorted reconnaissance flight described above
                            to take place on June 9, unless cancelled in the meantime. The President
                            also approved the press statement for release <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0180"/>between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sunday,
                            June 7.<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">Apparent reference to a statement

                            President further indicated that he was prepared to approve the proposed

                            recommended:</p>
                        <p>1. Flying of a mission on June 8th involving 6 or 8 fighter bombers in
                            advance of 2 reconnaissance planes to fly over an installation (Xieng
                            Khouang Ville). Fighter bombers taking out the antiaircraft installation
                            in advance. This would be a retaliatory action and it was agreed
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>2. Press release concerning the shootdown of the F–8.<note n="2" xml:id="d81fn2">See <ref target="#d80fn3">footnote 3, Document

                        <p>3. The positioning of a portion of the First Fleet to join the Seventh
                            Fleet in the Far East.</p>
                        <p>Note: This was item 13 on the courses of action.<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">Reference is to paragraph 13, subparagraph h, of the

                        </p>
                        <p>All attending the meeting approved. There was some discussion between
                            State and Defense as to whether the above mission should be <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0181"/>run June 8th or 9th. It was agreed to
                            run on June 9th because of a meeting taking place in Vientiane on June
                            8th.</p>
                        <p>The President continually raised the question of what we see down the
                            road. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said we seek a
                            government of national union and reestablishment of the terms of the
                            1962 accord. <persName>Johnson</persName> said our purpose was to
                            demonstrate the U.S. determination to preserve Laos and the actions
                            would assist the Soviets in supporting this position.</p>
                        <p>The President then said what if we do not take out the entire battery.
                            Are we in danger, and secondly, are we violating the sovereignty of
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName> stated, no we are not violating the
                            sovereignty since Souvanna had requested reconnaissance flights and
                            therefore we were responding to his request.
                                (<persName>Johnson</persName> did not specifically refer to the
                            fighter bomber action either in return of fire or in advance of fire as
                            anticipated on the June 9th flight.) <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and the President then aired exchanges on the
                            chances of the loss of another plane. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated that the Chiefs thought there was a very
                            small chance and he placed the chance of losses for missions at 5%. We
                            have run 138 missions with only 2 losses and this more or less verified
                            his estimate. With respect to this particular operation, which was
                            planned so the planes would go in on the safest route, take out the
                            target and then exit by the safest possible route, he estimated the
                            chances of a loss to be “only 1 in 500”.</p>
                        <p>The President and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> then
                            discussed the 1962 Accord and <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> stated that we wished to reestablish Kong Le's
                            position in the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> and to have the
                            status quo established as prior to the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            offensive actions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> stated we should want
                            more than that. We should want the full terms of the 1962 Accord
                            complied with. He noted that they had not been complied with, that
                            Souvanna originally planned to go to every section of Laos and create
                            political support for his government and the 1962 concept but in reality
                            he had been able to go to Vientiane and Luang Prabang and had only
                            travelled between the two cities by air, that the eastern part of Laos
                            had been controlled by the Pathet Lao, it had been used as access to
                            South Vietnam and if we agreed to merely the reestablishment of
                            conditions prior to the PL advance, we were in effect turning over
                            eastern Laos to the Communists for continued use in their effort against
                            South Vietnam. I therefore strongly urged that we concentrate on the
                            establishment of an adherence to all the conditions of the 1962 Accord.
                            At this point <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said this
                            was all very good, but he didn't think it could be brought about and
                            then he said that neither he nor any one else expected that the terms of
                            the 1962 Accord would be complied with, and when it was signed it was
                            recognized that such things as full access to all of Laos was probably
                            unattainable, even though the agreement provided it. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0182"/>
                        <p>The President then asked where we were going, or was this a day-to-day
                            affair. He seemed to be concerned that we were getting in a little
                            deeper all the time and not really answering the problem. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> noted that Rusk was concerned
                            over the practicality of our position as anti-aircraft and machine guns
                            were scattered over the entire <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question from the President, I stated that I felt there
                            was grave danger of us “sliding down the slippery slope” on day-to-day
                            decisions and that we did not have a full scenario of actions in view of
                            the military effort that was now being made. Both <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> challenged this, stating
                            there was a scenario carefully worked out and that it was set forth in
                            papers which had been approved and that the courses of action were
                            designed to apply increasing pressure on Laos.</p>
                        <p>Note: I let the discussion drop at this point, but I wish to return to
                            this issue as the papers referred to which were those considered on June
                            4th, specifically did not anticipate actual combat operations by U.S.
                            air either in support of regular flights or in advance of regular
                            flights. What is happening is that a scenario designed to bring pressure
                            on Laos during the period of negotiations under Article 4, <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> discussion on Polish proposal, are now
                            being considered as adequate under active military operation of a type
                            which has taken place in the last 2 days and is anticipated for June
                            9th. Check with <persName corresp="#p_CCL1">Cooper</persName> and

                        <p>1559. For Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>. I am deeply distressed over events of
                            past several days and am apprehensive that all our careful work of past
                            two years may be largely vitiated. Problem as I see it is that air
                            reconnaissance exercise, initiated (as far as I am concerned at least)
                            primarily as political instrument to provide some encouragement here and
                            serve as warning to Communists, risks becoming military exercise for its
                            own sake, running rapidly out of control, seriously endangering <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0183"/>our carefully managed position
                            with regard to Geneva Accords, our good relations with PriMin and
                            constructive relations with British, Canadians and others.</p>
                        <p>I now believe I made serious error in agreeing to approach PriMin
                            Saturday night<note n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">June 6.</note> to seek his
                            concurrence in sending armed escorts with recce planes. I yield to no
                            one in my concern over fate pilot of plane downed June 6 but these are
                            risks everyone must have known we were taking and, given political
                            background of situation, we should have resisted putting on fighter
                            escorts.</p>
                        <p>Escorts were put on but on clear understanding with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> that this would remain

                                (Department of State, Central Files, INT 6 PHOTO LAOS)</note> that
                            Department and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> have authorized
                            background identification of downed aircraft as fighter escort. I am at
                            a loss to understand why this was done. As long as our previous line was
                            maintained we could pass off bombings and strafings in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> area as work of T–28s however much <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> presented eye witness accounts of U.S.
                            jet involvement. Now, however, we have virtually acknowledged that U.S.
                            aircraft, not invited by <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, have been
                            bombing and strafing in Laos in direct violation of Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <p>I have no idea what is likely be PriMin's reaction when press queries him

                            <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1151 proposes that I follow
                            “same line” but am afraid I will require considerably more guidance than
                            that both to reply to press, to PriMin's further questions, to <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> inquiries (and perhaps charges), and to

                            will undoubtedly be jumped on this one.</p>
                        <p>I apologize for negative tone taken here and you may of course be assured
                            I will do everything possible at this end to minimize damage to U.S.
                            position. I hope U.S. military can be put under more stringent orders to
                            restrain themselves to actions that fit strictly into our political
                            requirements. I am every bit as frustrated as they but want to be sure
                            that if we move into U.S. military action we have chosen right time and
                            place. In <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0184"/>this connection see

                                paragraph of telegram 1551 from Vientiane, June 7, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> agreed that photo
                                reconnaissance over northwest Laos should not be lost track of, but
                                he wondered if the Department had given consideration to whether it
                                wanted to excite the Chinese at this stage. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> suggested covering this area
                                with reconnaissance flown by <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s
                                out of Luang Prabang. Only if the results were unsatisfactory should
                                U.S. jets overfly this politically sensitive area. (Ibid., POL 27
                                LAOS)</note> At this point it seems to me we would be wise to
                            institute at once scaling down of recce flights as already recommended
                            and withdraw fighter escort.</p>

                            above. Have we come to decision that after two years of Communist
                            violation of Geneva Accords and aggression in Laos, we are also taking

                            late. They had been delayed by discussing with Secretary <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0185"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in Newport, Rhode Island, the
                            recommendation to conduct an air strike with U.S. planes on a specified
                            target in Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said
                            both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s
                                messages<note n="2" xml:id="d83fn2">Reference is to telegram 1559
                                    (<ref target="#d82">Document 82</ref>) and telegram 1562 from
                                Vientiane, June 8, in which <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> reiterated his opposition to armed
                                reconnaissance and a retaliatory strike against a Xieng Khouang
                                anti-aircraft site. Unger suggested that attacks by Lao Air Force
                                    <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s would be “infinitely
                                preferable” to deployment of U.S. jets. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> was also concerned about international
                                reaction to plans to employ napalm in the attack, since it had not
                                been used before in Laos. (Department of State, Central Files, POL
                                27 LAOS)</note> had been relayed to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. After discussing the pros and
                            cons, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> favored going
                            ahead with the strike although he considered the decision to be an
                            extremely close one. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            said that he, Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> believed that the
                            arguments for the strike were stronger than did Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. They were firmer in their belief
                            that the President should authorize the strike today.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said the purpose of
                            the strike would be to convey a message to Hanoi. Unless we take some
                            action to convince Hanoi that we are serious, negotiations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> will not be
                            productive. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said he did not think
                            the strike would be as harmful to our relations with Souvanna as
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> thought. If we
                            attack a specific target we won't lose Souvanna by his giving up his
                            position.</p>
                        <p>It was clear that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            had written his cable 1559 (copy attached) without knowing specifically
                            what was planned in connection with the escorted aerial reconnaissance
                            and the air attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he
                            disagreed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            who had proposed that <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s be used to
                            take out the antiaircraft battery. He said that <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s flown by Vietnamese would not be able to destroy the
                            target. In his view, if another U.S. plane were knocked down, we would
                            have to respond by some military action, not necessarily an air
                            strike.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that he
                            was not satisfied with the way the reconnaissance flights had been
                            carried out by the Navy. He had asked the task force, for example, why
                            the U.S. planes had expended only seven rockets. He referred to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s comment about
                            the military<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">Apparent reference in telegram
                                1559 (<ref target="#d82">Document 82</ref>) to <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s statements that the
                                operation “risks becoming a military exercise for its own sake,
                                running rapidly out of control.”</note> and asked the State
                            Department to make clear to the Ambassador that the U.S. Government is
                            working together and that Defense is not operating unilaterally. He
                            noted that he had agreed that napalm should not be used because of the
                            excessive political cost involved in its use.</p>
                        <p>In response to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> opposed delaying the strike in order to allow
                            time for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> to talk
                            to Souvanna before <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0186"/>the strike.
                            Souvanna has to be against such an attack publicly, and, therefore, it
                            would be better to tell him after it had taken place. Privately, he will
                            not be as strongly opposed as he will have to be in public.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> asked what would be
                            risked if the strike were delayed for 24 hours, as had been mentioned by
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> following a
                            telephone conversation during which the current situation was
                                summarized.<note n="4" xml:id="d83fn4">No further record
                                found.</note> The general response was that nothing would be gained
                            by delaying the attack because we would learn little during the next 24
                            hours that we do not already know. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out that the attack
                            had already been delayed 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>General Carter recommended that the air strike be stood down on the
                            grounds that it is a precipitous action based on the normal desire to
                            retaliate against the shoot-down of two U.S. planes. He did not see it
                            as part of a scenario which was aimed at seeking to improve the
                            situation in Laos and South Vietnam. He stated this was Director
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s view.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> disagreed
                            sharply, saying that Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> had told him flatly at 1:30 PM on Sunday<note n="5" xml:id="d83fn5">June 7. For a record of the meeting, see <ref target="#d80">Documents 80</ref> and <ref target="#d81">81</ref>.</note> that he was for an air strike in Laos. General
                            Carter said he was not at the Sunday meeting but that he had been told
                            that the Director disapproved of the attack because it was not part of a
                            longer range plan to deal with the existing situation but rather an
                            action taken out of sequence. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> crossquestioned General Carter as to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>'s view, saying that
                            the Director may have changed his view, but as of Sunday, he had joined
                            with all the others in recommending Presidential authorization of the
                            specific air attack in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said: “Suppose
                            we decide not to make the strike? What would we do if we cancelled it?”
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> pointed out that
                            Canadian International Control Commission (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>) representative Seaborn would be in Hanoi on June
                                15.<note n="6" xml:id="d83fn6">A brief report of Seaborn's meeting
                                with Pham Van Dong on June 15 is printed in <ref target="frus1964-68v01">Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, vol.
                                    I</ref>, pp. 525–526.</note> The message he is to convey would
                            not be appropriate if we had not acted in some way in response to the
                            shootdown of our reconnaissance planes. He, in effect, would be going to
                            Hanoi with a broken stick.</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of low-level reconnaissance of North Vietnam as a
                            possible alternative. The general view was that such reconnaissance
                            would not be safe.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> recommended
                            strongly that the air attack be authorized. He opposed any delay and
                            said that we had no other plan to respond to the shoot-down.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0187"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we do not
                            have to recommend the air attack but that no other action we can take to
                            convey a message to Hanoi is comparable to an air attack. The
                            possibility of some of our planes being shot down was a real one but the
                            possibility that there would be a catastrophe was one chance in a
                            million. The risk of not doing anything is greater than doing what is
                            proposed. We must put additional pressure on Hanoi now.</p>
                        <p>In response to a suggestion that Laos and South Vietnam are separate
                            issues, <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alexis Johnson</persName> said the
                            relationship between the problems in the two countries is exemplified by
                            two chess boards, some plays being made on both boards.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he and
                            Deputy Secretary <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> had talked
                            to several Senators during the day, including Senators Saltonstall and
                            Russell. They had encountered less opposition than they had
                            anticipated.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said a perfect
                            attack would consist of hitting the antiaircraft battery and losing no
                            U.S. planes. If the fighters miss the antiaircraft battery but no planes
                            are lost, we can consider the attack successful. If the antiaircraft
                            battery is hit and a plane is lost, we can consider the attack
                            satisfactory. In the event of any of the above results, no further
                            reconnaissance measures will be flown for the time being and no further
                            retaliation would be undertaken. With respect to public information, we
                            would announce only that a reconnaissance mission had taken place. If
                            the Communists say our planes fired, we would say that the Communists
                            fired on our planes and we merely returned the fire.</p>
                        <p>Following a discussion of whether the air attack fitted into the existing
                            Laos scenario, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName>
                            described the attack as providing only a bump in the upward curve of the
                            military actions proposed in the scenario.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we must
                            make a reply to North Vietnamese military pressure by means of an attack
                            or by some other means.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s
                            views, it was pointed out that he was looking at the picture in a Laos
                            framework. The air attack was visualized as a signal to Hanoi covering
                            our total Southeast Asia policy.</p>
                        <p>With respect to whether the reconnaissance pictures we had obtained had
                            been worthwhile, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said they had been very useful, but that we
                            could do without them, as we had during the past two years. He
                            emphasized again we had one, not separate problems, in Vietnam and in
                            Laos. Aerial photographs of the specific target and the surrounding area
                            were circulated and examined by the group. It was pointed out that the
                            antiaircraft battery to be attacked was 7/10 of a mile from a
                            village.</p>
                        <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0188"/>
                        <p>Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said that we need to
                            reconsider previously discussed courses of action in the light of the
                            current situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> pointed out that
                            the papers in the gray folder had not been discussed with the President.
                            He had prepared a paper listing the diplomatic actions<note n="7" xml:id="d83fn7">Dated June 8 and entitled “Diplomatic Action
                                Concerning Southeast Asia.” (Johnson Library, National Security
                                File, Country File, Vietnam, Southeast Asia, Vol. II, Memos (A),
                                5/64–6/64)</note> for the immediate future and it was his
                            understanding that our current objective was to string out as long as
                            practicable any diplomatic conference involving Laos.</p>
                        <p>At this point (3:45 PM) the President joined the meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said the State
                            Department, including Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, agreed that the air attack should be made although
                            the decision was a close one. The risks involved in the attack were
                            offset by the absolute requirement to send a firm signal to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s cable be read to the group (No. 1559). Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that before
                            the message was read, he wanted to point out that when Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> had sent the telegram he
                            did not know of our plan to launch a single retaliatory attack.</p>
                        <p>The President, referring to a paragraph in Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s message, asked whether we had
                            agreed to keep secret the fact that we were sending fighter escorts with
                            the reconnaissance planes. The answer was that we had not said we would
                            not send escort fighters, but we had probably not made clear to Souvanna
                            what we would do following a shoot-down of an unarmed reconnaissance
                            plane.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> then read 1559 and
                            1562 (copy attached).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> noted that we
                            had already reduced our reconnaissance flights from ten to one. In
                            reference to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s
                            opposition to suppressive attacks on antiaircraft batteries, he said
                            that we were not doing this except in the one specific case now being
                            recommended. He repeated his flat statement that the antiaircraft
                            battery could not be destroyed by Vietnamese pilots using T–28
                            airplanes, as Ambassador Unger believed. The <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s would be lost to ground fire if they tried to attack
                            an antiaircraft battery and the Vietnamese pilots had insufficient
                            inability to deal with the targets.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated some of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s comments to the effect that we were abandoning
                            the Geneva Accords and violating them in a way which we had not done
                            previously, despite Communist violations over the past two years. The
                            President asked how we answered the accusation that an air attack would
                            violate the Geneva Accords.</p>
                        <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0189"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said the Communists
                            had broken the Geneva agreements. We had sent in reconnaissance planes
                            to obtain information which the ICC could not get. This information was
                            very important to us because we needed to know how the Communists were
                            violating the Accords and whether they were initiating a buildup with a
                            view to capturing the Mekong River cities. We were invited to carry out
                            reconnaissance missions by Souvanna who was not asked to agree to
                            fighter escorts but did not oppose our sending in fighter escorts when
                            we told him we were. We have to get a message to Hanoi to convince
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName> that we are
                            serious, that we haven't backed down, and that we are not scared off by
                            attacks on our planes.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the gains in taking out the antiaircraft
                            battery are sufficient to offset world criticism that we are violating
                            the Geneva Accords. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that he did not think the air attack
                            violated the Accords. Others present agreed that Communist violations of
                            the Accord had altered the situation. In addition, we had sent in
                            reconnaissance planes on a peaceful mission. These planes had been shot
                            at. Therefore, we were entitled to reply to the hostile action taken
                            against our peaceful planes.</p>
                        <p>The President said Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            felt that if we launched such an attack the Souvanna Government would
                            fall. Others disagreed that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> had made this point. The telegram was re-read in
                            an effort to clarify exactly what Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> had said.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had failed to carry out its duty
                            of maintaining peace in the area. The Pathet Lao forces had advanced.
                            Souvanna had agreed to aerial reconnaissance by U.S. planes and did not
                            object when we told him that we were going to send in fighter escorts
                            with our reconnaissance planes. He repeated his view that the legal
                            situation consisted merely of the Communists firing on escort planes and
                            our returning the fire.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether anyone present was bothered by the charge
                            that if we took out an antiaircraft battery we would be violating the
                            Geneva Accords. He was bothered. Everyone acknowledged that the
                            Communists had violated the Accords. If we go on further we will be
                            throwing to the winds the Geneva Accords. In addition, we may lose
                            Souvanna. The Communists are not expected to be responsible, but we are
                            responsible people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out that if
                            we decide not to make the air attack proposed, we would be criticized
                            because we didn't respond to the hostile actions of the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The President asked: “What happens after the antiaircraft battery is
                            attacked?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> referred
                            to a list of nineteen military actions <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0190"/>from which we could choose.<note n="8" xml:id="d83fn8">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> is apparently
                                referring to a paper entitled “Illustrative Military Moves designed
                                to Demonstrate U.S. Intention to Prevent Further Communist Advances
                                in Laos and South Vietnam”; see the Attachment to <ref target="#d71">Document 71</ref>.</note> One such action was the movement of
                            an additional carrier to the seas off South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President asked whether the air attack might not “blow” the meeting
                            proposed by the Poles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> responded that it might, but if we took no
                            military action now, we would obtain no concession from the Communists
                            at the Poles' meeting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he saw no
                            possibility of obtaining any concessions from the Communists during the
                            Poles' meeting. The question is how to prevent further deterioration of
                            the situation in Laos but one thing he was sure we must not do is to
                            show any weakness in the face of hostile Communist actions.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what we do if they knock down a bunch of planes.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we have
                            to take some military action. He doubted that we could push the Pathet
                            Lao back to where they were before their recent attack, but we must take
                            some military action, such as the air strike, if we are to prevent
                            further deterioration in our position in the area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said he did not write off
                            completely the Polish talks which might help halt Communist aggression.
                            He acknowledged that this was not very likely.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, noting that
                            it was 4:30 PM, said that if the decision was to halt the mission, he
                            must send a cable immediately because the planes were authorized to take
                            off at dawn unless otherwise notified.</p>
                        <p>The President asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>
                            if he would recommend the air strike if it meant losing Souvanna. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> and the other State
                            officers replied “no,” they did not recommend the strike if it meant
                            losing Souvanna, but they did not think we would lose Souvanna if the
                            attack took place. They added that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> did not know our full plan when he talked to
                            Souvanna, and, therefore, some arguments he could have used he did not
                            use. A cable giving him the full picture would be sent immediately.<note n="9" xml:id="d83fn9">

                        </p>
                        <p>The President said that even if Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> knows all about the plan, he very much doubts that
                            the Ambassador would agree that it was a good thing to do.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what would happen if the strike were delayed for 24
                            hours. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> replied that
                            damage would not be great but it would reveal a certain amount of
                            indecision on our part. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the decision was a political one and not a
                            military one. The air attack was one way of affecting any negotiations
                            with Hanoi.</p>

                        <p>The President was brought a note and he left the room. In his absence,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we
                            cannot go on as we now are. We can take an entirely different course but
                            we cannot continue talking tough and acting weak as we are now doing. He
                            said he was even ready to give up Southeast Asia but now we must back up
                            the words we have already spoken about our firmness of purpose. He had
                            been concerned ever since the President's Los Angeles speech<note n="10" xml:id="d83fn10">Reference is to the President's remarks at the

                                959–960.</note> which conveyed the thought that we were going to act
                            firmly in Southeast Asia. We must be careful not to convey an impression
                            of strong action when, in effect, we are not so acting. If we do not
                            make the proposed air attack, we should change the very strong message
                            which we have asked Seaborn to convey to Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to repeat his
                            statements to the President upon his return.</p>
                        <p>The President returned and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> re-stated his view. He was deeply concerned
                            about the inconsistency between our words and our action. Ever since the
                            Los Angeles speech, he has been concerned that we had no plan to back up
                            the words contained in that speech. He said there has been much tough
                            talk by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and by
                            himself. He referred to the <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            interviews in New Delhi<note n="11" xml:id="d83fn11">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was in New Delhi for
                                Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's funeral, May 28–30. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s interviews have not been
                                further identified.</note> in which the Japanese were told of our
                            firm intention to prevent the Southeast Asia situation from
                            deteriorating further. It is most dangerous, especially with the
                            Chinese, to have our adversaries conclude that we talk tough but act
                            weakly. He does not oppose cancelling the air strike, but if we do, we
                            must change our talk immediately. The President is not responsible for
                            creating an impression of tough talk but his advisers are. We must
                            change our talk and our present inconsistency.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> said the air attack
                            was the only way that we could signal Hanoi. If we don't send this
                            signal, the situation will deteriorate in Southeast Asia. Souvanna may
                            object publicly to our action but he will not be too unhappy in private.
                            One day later we will know little more than we know now. There are fewer
                            risks in going forward than in not acting.</p>
                        <p>The President said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> may have made a point in his remarks about what
                            we have been saying in speeches. However, we are not now deciding what
                            to put in a speech, but we are talking about something much more
                            important, namely, an action involving an attack on an antiaircraft
                            battery in Laos. We are here considering whether this <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0192"/>action should be taken. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s cable distressed him
                            because he thought what we had been doing and were planning to do was
                            done with the consent and knowledge of the Laos Government. He asked why
                            the air attack was to be launched from Saigon rather than from an
                            antiaircraft carrier. He wanted to know why an attack from Saigon would
                            not be justification for the Communists to attack South Vietnam. What we
                            do on the high seas is our business, but to attack in Laos would give
                            the Communists a basis for launching an attack in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said the North
                            Vietnamese had no air force, and, therefore, whether we attack from the
                            sea or from Saigon made no difference insofar as retaliation by the
                            North Vietnamese was concerned. Any Communist aircraft which could
                            attack South Vietnam would have to come from Communist China. Communist
                            retaliation is very unlikely.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> responded by
                            saying that we were planning to attack from South Vietnam before we
                            could use U.S. Air Force pilots who, in his opinion, are better prepared
                            for the kind of attack proposed. He criticized the June 7 Navy operation
                            from the aircraft carrier, saying that the reconnaissance planes were
                            split into two groups, they came in over their target too high, and they
                            apparently used Sidewinder air-to- air rockets when they should have
                            used only air-to-ground missiles. General <persName corresp="#p_LMGCE1">LeMay</persName> had said that he felt the Navy task force missions
                            had not been as efficiently planned as the Air Force would have planned
                            them.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's question, General Carter said he had
                            earlier recommended strongly against the air attack. He added, however,
                            that this was his judgment and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> did
                            not have an agency view on the policy decision. He recommended that the
                            air strike be delayed for 24–48 hours if for no other reason than to
                            acquaint Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> with the
                            reasons why the attack was being launched. He said his personal view was
                            that the air strike was motivated by a desire to retaliate against the
                            loss of our planes and did not fit into a plan aimed at improving our
                            situation in Southeast Asia. He repeated, however, that this was a
                            question of judgment and acknowledged that he had no alternative
                            proposal to suggest which would have the effect of letting Hanoi know
                            that we were serious about our position in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The President said that we should go ahead with the mission but that he
                            had doubts about the action.</p>

                            now know that they took place and infer that we did actually fire. So
                            far no reaction reported. We are perhaps more concerned about <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0194"/>Indian reaction than any other
                            and you should perhaps seek hold Indian Ambassador and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> hand to maximum.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, Souvanna himself remains critical. You can best judge whether
                            it useful discuss problem with him during day June 9 or whether it best
                            you await results and act accordingly. Obviously you should not indicate
                            in any way prior knowledge extent June 9 mission, but you might tell him
                            you believe this escorted mission planned but to be followed by recess.
                            You should certainly make clear to him and to all others our actions
                            concerning recon mission do not indicate in any way we throwing away
                            Geneva Accords but rather that we taking necessary action to carry on
                            recon operations which fully justified within spirit Geneva Accords and

                        <p>Above drafted before receiving your 1563.<note n="6" xml:id="d84fn6">In
                                telegram 1563 from Vientiane, June 8, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stated that since the strike against Xieng
                                Khouang was designed to demonstrate that the Pathet Lao could not
                                shoot down reconnaissance planes without punishment and to offset
                                the international psychological lift of their having done so,
                                attacks by <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s armed with napalm
                                and continued reconnaissance flights would have the same effect.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stated that
                                acknowledgment of U.S. armed attack in Laos put the United States in
                                severe risk of going “over the dam” of the Geneva settlement.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> We weighed
                            alternative possibilities continuing recce missions without escort and
                            attacking anti-aircraft sites with <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s. We rejected former on grounds no safe flight path could
                            be guaranteed and another shootdown without active US measures would
                            above all give Hanoi and Peking another lift and would almost certainly
                            be heavily criticized in US and possibly lose us crucial support for
                            whole course of action we pursuing in Southeast Asia. We rejected latter
                            on grounds military judgment here that it would be ineffective and
                            almost certainly produce serious loss unless napalm used which we
                            thought had other serious disadvantages particularly in international
                            sphere.</p>
                        <p>We also rejected alternative another generalized escorted mission on
                            grounds this might produce another loss with no offsetting advantage
                            damage to other side and thus really force our hand for next move.</p>
                        <p>We understand fully your point about risks being daily incurred by your
                            aircraft and those from Udorn and our hats are off to all concerned.
                            Fact is that damage to our overt reconnaissance creates different
                            pressures both in relation to Hanoi and Peking and in relation to US
                            public.</p>
                        <p>Your 1564 now received.<note n="7" xml:id="d84fn7">In telegram 1564, June
                                8, <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stated that it would
                                be impossible to ascertain Souvanna's reaction, but given that he
                                agreed to armed reconnaissance only with the promise of no
                                publicity, Souvanna would hardly approve of an acknowledged air
                                strike. (Ibid.)</note> You should certainly follow line with
                            Souvanna that attacks in June 9 mission were in response hostile fire
                            (which indeed probable once aircraft in area).</p>
                        <p>Secretary wants you to know that he feels our principal chance of turning
                            the Southeast Asian situation around without large scale military <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0195"/>action of one sort or another
                            lies in our getting effective signals to Hanoi and Peiping that they
                            must leave their neighbors alone before events go too far. In your
                            discussion with Souvanna, if the strike of June 9th comes up in a
                            different form, you are authorized to tell him that certain steps are
                            underway, which you are not at liberty to disclose, to make very clear
                            to Hanoi that they are embarked upon an exceedingly dangerous course of
                            action in their gross and persistent violations of the Geneva Accords.
                            The timing of our reaction as of June 9 is related to that signal to
                            Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>Secretary also believes that you should not, even within your own staff,
                            take the view that such actions on our part are themselves violations of
                            the Geneva Accords. It is a well established principle of international
                            law that where one side grossly violates particular provisions of an
                            agreement such as those forbidding Viet Minh personnel in Laos or the
                            use of Laos as a corridor to South Viet-Nam that those unilateral
                            violations relieve other parties of relevant restrictions upon
                            themselves. Our objective remains the fullest execution of and
                            meticulous compliance with the Geneva Accords. We are ready to work with
                            everyone and anyone to obtain full compliance on all sides. Central to
                            our policy is full support for <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna

                        <p>H—What's your reaction to this morning's take? The Secy made a good
                            addition (tel to <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>).<note n="2" xml:id="d85fn2">Reference is to a revision in <ref target="#d84">Document 84</ref> made by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>. In the last sentence of the

                            is off the track. He is quite for going on with this thing (further
                            bombing) regardless.</p>
                        <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0196"/>
                        <p>F—No one is in favor except him. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> is not in favor.</p>
                        <p>H—It is interesting, his thought that we should put some attack planes in
                            if there is an attack. That is an entirely different proposition. They
                            are worried about something coming from overhead. Then they have the
                            sublime (faith) in the <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s. I have
                            never imagined they would do much damage.</p>
                        <p>F—<persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> asked for a high-level
                            letter (to <gloss target="#t_SP1">SP</gloss>) from LBJ. We are against
                            it. Do you feel you could do a comforting letter?</p>
                        <p>H—I think it's the wrong thing to do, but I am perfectly willing to do it
                            if it is the net balance. Seems to me this is a job <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> ought to do. It's certainly not a
                            good thing for the President to do. If anybody should send it, I should.
                            The idea of his thinking we could keep things quiet like the Soviet
                            press, is fantastic. I have never seen anything which made me believe
                            that we had taken a commitment not to say anything (to the press re
                            fighter escort plane).</p>
                        <p>F—Prior to shooting down one of these planes it never occurred to
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> what we do if we get
                            hit. They failed to think it thru.</p>
                        <p>H—I took up cutting out those two letters (on the plane). Bob McNamara
                            said I can't handle it on the Hill. The announcement we would have made
                            would have been exactly as <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            suggested if we took out those numbers. So I raised it. Bob said, “I
                            can't live with it.” You will get found out sooner or later so we
                            accepted that. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has to
                            understand. <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName> has been
                            getting something to the Secy to take to the President. It is
                            interesting that <gloss target="#t_SP1">SP</gloss> suggested a certain
                            operation if the other people did something. I think that would be a
                            very, very dangerous thing to do.</p>
                        <p>F—That is way down the road.</p>
                        <p>F—The next step if we do anything at all is to change the fleet
                            movement.</p>
                        <p>H—Bob thought that was probably the best. Do you think we are on the
                            wrong track—that <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> is right
                            about this? I don't see it myself.</p>
                        <p>F—No.</p>
                        <p>H—The trouble is that <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>
                                (<persName>Bundy</persName>) didn't send enough background stuff. I
                            just can't understand why they didn't do it. It's a one-man show,
                            instead of getting a team play. When you're active yourself you feel as
                            if you are achieving something, but it isn't done. I still believe it
                            was a wise thing to do. I hope that the President thinks so.
                            Incidentally to take the conceit out of some people who will be
                            nameless. It is really preposterous. Not the ones we talk to. The ones
                            in the background. This is two flops—yet they come forward next time
                            with just as much assurance. It is a damn good thing because otherwise
                            you couldn't win wars. But they shouldn't be allowed to sit in on policy
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>F—I tried to persuade Mac (Bundy) to let me and him pull over here to the
                            White House some of the working people to try to begin to blow a <pb n="165" xml:id="pg_165" facs="0197"/>new course. He says no. He
                            wants to leave it to <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> to
                            try.—To push State to taking the lead. I said if it will work.</p>
                        <p>H: The trouble is <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName> is so
                            (involved) in operational details.</p>
                        <p>F: I hope for a meeting tomorrow and then with the President the next
                            day.</p>
                        <p>H—I think it is too early. I think if you try you are apt to rush
                            decisions. This is what President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> wanted, but not President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> who wants things thought
                            through. I don't think we'll have things digested enough.</p>
                        <p>F—I don't have the feeling that everybody is thinking very much.</p>

                        <p>What follows is in the context of my full support for whatever decisions
                            you may have to take under the awesome responsibilities of your office.
                            You alone have all the available facts and considerations. You alone can
                            make the decisions. From the Senate, we can only give you, in the last
                            analysis, our trust, our support and such independent thoughts as may
                            occur to us from time to time in the hope that they may be
                            constructive.</p>
                        <p>You know far better than I how delicate a manoeuvre was, first, the
                            reconnaissance flights and, second, the bombing of the anti-aircraft
                            sites in Laos. These two steps have opened up the immediate possibility
                            of a far more direct U.S. military involvement in Laos than we now have
                            in Viet Nam.</p>
                        <p>I presume that the reconnaissance flights were designed primarily as a
                            show of U.S. determination and as an aid of some sort for the government
                            of Laos. Nevertheless, they did lead to the shooting down of the U.S.
                            planes and then to the U.S. bombing of anti-aircraft sites.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, this process of action and reaction can continue and grow
                            deeper. It may be that circumstances require that the process continue
                                <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0198"/>and deepen. Only you are in
                            a position to make that determination in the light of the whole of the
                            interests of the nation.</p>
                        <p>But I gather from our telephone conversation<note n="2" xml:id="d86fn2">Not further identified.</note> that a deepening of the involvement
                            is not what you believe desirable or necessary in terms of the nation's
                            interest. You indicated to me that the bombing of the sites was not to
                            be repeated. But you cannot count on the absence of the need for
                            repetitions of the bombings so long as the reconnaissance flights
                            continue over Laos. What happens if other U.S. reconnaissance planes are
                            shot down? Having once taken out anti-aircraft sites by bombing are we
                            not to repeat the operation? And if we cannot stop the attrition by air
                            must we not do it by land force or suffer the ignominious consequences?
                            I think it is most dangerous to assume that if the reconnaissance
                            flights continue, additional U.S. planes will not be shot at and, if
                            they fly low enough, that some will not be brought down.</p>
                        <p>The basic reality remains: if it is not in the national interest to
                            become deeply involved in a military sense on the Laotian front, we will
                            avoid those actions which can impel us, even against our inclination or
                            expectation, to become more deeply involved. We will avoid further
                            unilateral commitments and actions and take every possible initiative to
                            bring about a peaceful settlement. But if our interests justify, in the
                            last analysis, becoming fully involved on the Southeast Asian mainland
                            then there is no issue. What must be done will be done.</p>
                        <p>My own views are well-known. On the basis of my limited knowledge I do
                            not conclude that our national interests are served by a deep military
                            involvement in Southeast Asia. But in this situation, what I or any
                            other Senator may conclude is secondary. The responsibility rests with
                            you and we can only give you our support in whatever decisions you may
                            make.</p>
                        <p>If the decisions must be for a continuance of the course which is leading
                            to deeper involvement, however, I would most respectfully suggest that
                            the basis for these decisions must be made much clearer and more
                            persuasive to the people of the nation than has heretofore been the
                            case. In my judgment, public attitudes are far from understanding, much
                            less accepting, even the limited degree of our present involvement in
                            Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The following are our objectives in Laos:</p>
                        <p>1. Preserve <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> as the
                            Head of a Government of National Union, or at least as the Head of a
                            government composed of the Neutralists and the Right Wing, leaving a
                            door open to Communist participation.</p>
                        <p>2. Discourage further Pathet Lao grabs of territory.</p>
                        <p>3. Accomplish the above two objectives in such a way as to avoid
                            dangerously demoralizing the South Vietnamese and the Thai.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Period of the Polish Conference</p>
                        <p>Our most immediate problem is probably not further Pathet Lao military
                            grabs, but rather the preservation of <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. Today he announced that he had asked
                            the U.S. to cease reconnaissance activities over the Plain of Jars. This
                            will probably further expose him to the risk of an overthrow by the
                            Right Wing forces of <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> should seek out <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> immediately and leave them in no doubt that
                            we still support Souvanna and would take the most drastic measures
                            against the Right Wing in the event they attempted to overthrow him.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna's military and political position is probably now very weak and
                            we therefore need to do what can be done, independently of any
                            international negotiations, to shore it up.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>We try to re-establish Kong Le in some other territorial base, perhaps
                            Luang Prabang, using air if necessary as part of a refugee
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>We increase our economic, as well as military, aid to him and his
                            supporters and encourage as intense cooperation as possible between Kong
                            Le and the Meo under the leadership of Vang Pao.</p>
                        <p>Before the beginning of the Polish conference, either we bring the
                            Canadians and the British here, or we send briefing teams to London and
                            Ottawa in order to explain to them and persuade them that our primary
                                <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0200"/>objective is to reduce
                            tension in Laos. To do this we need to have the Polish discussions go on
                            as long as possible. During these discussions we would not expect to
                            secure a withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> from the
                            Plain of Jars, although this would be an initial demand. We should
                            concentrate on using the Polish forum as a way of pressuring the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and the Right Wing into an agreement to
                            preserve the Government of National Union. During this period Souvanna
                            will become even more vulnerable to Right Wing attack; so we must devise
                            every means of neutralizing <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, while at the same
                            time bolstering Souvanna.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>Explore the possibility of providing funds and goods directly to Souvanna
                            and his allies in substantial quantities.</p>
                        <p>Reduce, if necessary, our support of the Right Wing in Vientiane, taking
                            into account the risk of a violent reaction by <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (1–1/2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>It must be expected that the Polish discussions will fail to achieve any
                            of these objectives and will result only in a call for a 14-nation
                            Geneva conference. Souvanna might well be persuaded to attend, if the
                            Right Wing did not assassinate him beforehand.</p>
                        <p>We would then have two choices: we might tell the Right Wing that unless
                            they cooperated with us, we would be forced ourselves to attend the
                            Geneva conference; but that if they did cooperate, we would refuse to
                            attend and continue our support to them. We might also agree with the
                            Thais and the South Vietnamese that we would not attend a Geneva
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>If the conference should then take place, without our participation, our
                            objective would be, with the help of our British and Canadian friends
                            and of Souvanna, to drag it on as long as possible. At the same time, or
                            perhaps prior to this, we would take (or would have taken) certain
                            actions designed to discourage the Pathet Lao, at least temporarily,
                            from further territorial encroachment. We should also consider
                            high-level reconnaissance of the trail networks in Laos, both to keep
                            track of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-VM deployments and also for
                            use by the British and Canadians at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>If the Geneva conference should fail to assemble because of our refusal
                            to attend, we should consider resorting to some of the pre-Geneva 1962
                            measures, which we abandoned then. Among these would be heavily
                            increased supply of money, weapons and goods to Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>; maintenance of our level of
                            supplies to <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s forces;
                            possible re-introduction of some American advisory presence in the form
                            of a small MAAG and/or White Star teams; U.S.-led <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> combat intelligence operations in the
                            panhandle; and a beefing up of American operated air transport
                            facilities within Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0201"/>
                        <p>The objective of the above would be to improve the bargaining position of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> when and if
                            the Geneva conference might occur. Ideally, we would at least go back to
                            another Geneva conference in about the same position we were in May
                            1962. A second objective of these actions would be to reassure the
                            Vietnamese and the Thai that we would not negotiate in Geneva from a
                            position of complete impotence.</p>
                        <p>Another alternative would be to agree to attend a Geneva conference, but
                            only after we made it clear that we intended to return to the status quo
                            ante-May 1962 in Laos. The only difference between this alternative and
                            the previous one is that we would go to a Geneva conference before we
                            had completed the actions described above. If we took this route, it
                            would probably be essential to take somewhat stronger action in the form
                            of military deployments and cross border activities in order to convince
                            the South Vietnamese and the Thai that we were not throwing in the
                            towel.</p>
                        <p>If it is possible to keep the South Vietnamese, the Thai, and the Right
                            Wing in Vientiane in hand, the actions described above might carry us
                            through the early part of 1965, i.e. until the normal time for the
                            Pathet Lao to attempt another bite.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> gives up or is
                            liquidated during the course of the above scenario, we should consider
                            the formal partition of Laos. In any such partition all international
                            restraints on our efforts to support the Right Wing would have to be
                            eliminated. If Souvanna were lost during an international conference, we
                            would press for formal recognition of a divided Laos, insisting, of
                            course, on Right Wing control of the panhandle at least from Paksane
                            south. The negotiation of any such solution would obviously be very long
                            drawn out and involve many such thorny questions such as what to do
                            about the Meo and the demarcation of the partition lines in the
                            North.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The first question which arose was what statement should be made to the
                            press about the reconnaissance missions over Laos.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we should
                            say that a U.S. reconnaissance mission was flown in Laos, that it was
                            fired upon, and that the U.S. planes fired back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said this
                            statement was not true and strongly cautioned that nothing be said now
                            which later could be used to prove that the U.S. Government had told a
                            lie. He said the U.S. must not risk being exposed as making false
                            statements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> referred to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s plea contained
                            in his telegram 1586 (copy attached) that the U.S. not admit that the
                            planes escorting the reconnaissance planes had used suppressive
                                fire.<note n="4" xml:id="d88fn4">Dated June 10. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, INT 6 PHOTO LAOS)</note> The Ambassador's
                            cable was in response to a request for his views when it appeared here
                            that it would almost be impossible to maintain our position of “no
                            comment” in reply to questions concerning the firing of U.S. planes in
                            Laos. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> said that
                            at an earlier meeting this <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0203"/>morning<note n="5" xml:id="d88fn5">No record of this meeting has
                                been found.</note> all present had agreed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s reasoning and he asked that the
                            present group agree to stand on “no comment.” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> agreed that refusing to
                            comment on operations was a much better position than one which, in
                            effect, was not true.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked whether the
                            press furor over the “no comment” position would blow over in a few
                            days. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> replied that he
                            thought that press interest in the Laos operation would be very
                            short-lived. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>
                            said that Senator Morse would undoubtedly yell but we could live with
                            his criticism.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, who had just
                            returned from the Hill, said that he felt that there was little
                            Congressional interest in the Laos situation. He noted that several
                            Congressmen had reacted almost with boredom to a discussion of the
                            reconnaissance flights in Laos. He wondered whether we and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> had built up the air
                            strike out of all proportion.</p>
                        <p>In response to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                            question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> said there had
                            been some international interest in our air activity in Laos, but there
                            had been no huge international outcry over press reports to date.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said our long-range
                            stake in keeping Souvanna in power in Laos was great. He thought that we
                            should back our Ambassador in the field. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> agreed as to what we would
                            say to the press. However, he thought that to Members of Congress and
                            friendly governments we should say that U.S. reconnaissance missions
                            over Laos had been fired on and we fired back. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> repeated his statement
                            that this would not be the truth. He strongly disagreed that we should
                            make such a statement because he believed that it would not stick and
                            the true facts would become public.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> said we would be
                            making a general statement without reference to a specific mission.<note n="6" xml:id="d88fn6">Dated June 11; for text, see American Foreign
                                Policy: Current Documents, 1964, pp.
                                932–933.</note> We would simply say that reconnaissance missions
                            were being flown in Laos and our planes were authorized to fire back
                            when they were fired upon. We would not admit that we had carried out a
                            suppressive mission. The British do not know that we carried out a
                            specific air strike. The only explanation we would make to foreigners
                            would be that there has been firing in Laos by U.S. planes because they
                            had been fired upon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> urged that
                            everyone in the room agree on one position to be taken by all so that
                            all discussions of this subject would be identical.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> was
                            asked to draft guidance for the use of everyone to include statements to
                            the press, statements to Congressmen, and statements to foreign nations.
                            It was agreed that we <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0204"/>would
                            continue to stand on “no comment” to the press but that Congressmen and
                            foreign government officials would be told that our planes had been
                            fired on and that they had fired back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> said that the
                            International Control Commission (<gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>)
                            inspectors were on the ground in the general area where firing had taken
                            place. It is possible that they may see bomb craters caused by U.S.
                            planes. There is doubt that <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi
                                Minh</persName> would allow the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            to inspect Khang Khay because he would thereby reveal to outsiders the
                            existence of antiaircraft batteries manned by Viet Minh crews. In
                            addition, he would be creating a precedent of allowing the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> inspectors to enter Communist-held
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>The group then considered the paper entitled “Defuzing Laos.”<note n="7" xml:id="d88fn7">
                                <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> summarized its content and
                            said that its purpose was to reduce pressures in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that if we
                            accomplished the first objective stated in the paper, we would be in a
                            hell of a shape. Our real objective in Laos is to get strict compliance
                            with the 1962 Geneva Accords, which means getting the Pathet Lao out of
                            Laos. We have taken this position recently with important foreign
                            nations including the Soviet Union. We should push hard in any
                            conference, such as that proposed by the Poles, for our prerequisites
                            for a Geneva-type conference. It is in our interest to keep the Russians
                            and the Poles in opposition to the Chinese Communists and <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>. We should not give up the
                            effort to get the Pathet Lao out of the Plaine des Jarres by diplomatic
                            means. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said he
                            thought our objective was to keep Souvanna in power so that we could go
                            ahead with our major objective which is to improve the situation in
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we must
                            not keep on restating unrealizeable objectives. He said we have no
                            program which, in his view, will result in forcing the Pathet Lao out of
                            the Plaine des Jarres.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> suggested that a
                            paper should be prepared which spells out the position which we have
                            just taken with Khrushchev.<note n="8" xml:id="d88fn8">Not further
                                identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said that
                            nothing now planned will get the Pathet Lao out of the Plaine des
                            Jarres. Only General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> could
                            do this by using U.S. military force and he would resign before agreeing
                            to put U.S. troops into the Plaine des Jarres. The important problem is
                            South Vietnam, not the presence of the Pathet Lao in the Plaine des
                            Jarres.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the defuzing
                            paper surrenders our objective of seeking a pressure point against Hanoi
                            and would result in giving Souvanna and the Thais a very leaden feeling.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said if it <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0205"/>were true that the proposed
                            policy would give Souvanna and the Thais a leaden feeling, this would be
                            a valid reason to oppose it, but he did not think that its lack of
                            effect on the Pathet Lao problem in the Plaine des Jarres was a valid
                            objection.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the
                            President had been confused because there has always been a difference
                            between our stated objectives and our courses of action. He expressed in
                            several ways his view that the actions we have proposed to the President
                            will not achieve our stated objectives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said we have
                            never told the President that the Communists had now gone too far and
                            that we propose to throw them out. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that our objective is certainly not to
                            support Souvanna solely for the purpose of halting further Pathet Lao
                            advances. Our objective is to force the Pathet Lao to retreat. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said he
                            thought that our policy was aimed at trying to avoid bringing things to
                            a military head over Laos.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he visualized
                            our Laos policy in three stages. The first preventive stage was to take
                            those actions necessary to be ready militarily to do more than we are
                            now doing if it appeared that the Pathet Lao was undertaking a campaign
                            to seize the Mekong River towns. The second stage was to do all we could
                            during the Polish-proposed conference to achieve our preconditions for a
                            Geneva conference. We may not achieve this objective but we might. We
                            simply don't know. The third stage would be a Geneva conference at which
                            we would seek to obtain the removal of the Viet Minh from Laos and South
                            Vietnam and close the North Vietnam corridor to the South
                            Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked whether
                            we would go to a Geneva conference if we did not obtain the
                            preconditions. Secretary Rusk replied that we would not. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that,
                            therefore, there would be no conference. The defuzing paper is to look
                            at the situation we would be in without a Geneva-type conference. The
                            plan is based on not taking U.S. military action until we had obtained a
                            Congressional resolution, which it did not appear would be obtainable
                            very soon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked why we should
                            not take as our objective the most probable contingency facing us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> suggested
                            that, for the President, we prepare a paper which gave our stated
                            objective being sought on the diplomatic track. The paper would
                            acknowledge that we were unlikely to achieve our stated objective by
                            diplomatic means and that, therefore, we propose to deviate from the
                            diplomatic track and then state what we would do. He felt that we were
                            leading the President down a track which would oblige him to resort to
                            the use of military force in the next three months if the situation were
                            to be saved. He expressed his fear that the conference route will run
                            out in a few weeks and then there will be nothing left for us to do but
                            use U.S. military force.</p>
                        <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0206"/>
                        <p>Director <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> expressed his
                            concern that we would not be able to resist world public pressure for a
                            conference by saying merely that we won't go to a conference unless the
                            Pathet Lao holds back a few miles in the Plaine des Jarres. Secretary
                            Rusk replied that the Pathet Lao pullback, which is a prerequisite for
                            the conference, would not be difficult for the Communists to agree to
                            do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RC1">Rowan</persName> said he wanted to make
                            certain that all were aware of the danger of having public objectives
                            which differed from objectives known only to government officials. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said the objectives
                            listed in his paper should accurately be described as interim
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> wanted to know how we
                            proposed to discourage further Pathet Lao territorial grabs as stated in
                            objective number two. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> said the actions he had in mind involved those
                            listed under point thirteen of the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> report, including the movement to the area of
                            U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked that he be
                            permitted to study the paper for another day or so. He was concerned
                            that if we gave up the objective of moving the Pathet Lao back, we might
                            forfeit the effort which we have been making in Moscow and indirectly in
                            Peking.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said we do
                            have military actions which could be used to prevent the Pathet Lao from
                            grabbing further territory in Laos, but we do not have actions which he
                            felt were adequate to force the Pathet Lao to get out of the Plaine des
                            Jarres.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said he did not feel
                            that a mountainous diplomatic effort would be necessary to get the
                            Pathet Lao back to their previous lines. The Soviets have a stake in not
                            ratting out on the agreement they have with us on Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>, who had been
                            out of the meeting for a few minutes, returned to say that he had told
                            the President it would not be necessary for him to join the group today
                            because another working session would be required before the group was
                            ready to discuss recommendations with him.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. position with respect to reconnaissance and escorts over Laos
                            will be “no comment with respect to operations”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> will review a paper on our
                            objectives in Laos and efforts to “defuze” the situation there,<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2">See <ref target="#d87">Document
                                87</ref>.</note> he believing that we must maintain our objectives
                            as the withdrawal of the Viet Minh and returning to the 1962 Accords,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge</persName>
                            <persName>Bundy</persName> suggesting that a more realistic approach is
                            to consider our interim objective as merely to repel further Pathet Lao
                            advances. With respect to South Vietnam it was agreed that the morale of
                            the South Vietnamese must be actively considered in any step taken with
                            regard to Laos or Southeast Asia as a whole. With respect to <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ability to improve its
                            counterinsurgency it was agreed that we should go ahead with a trial
                            infusion of U.S. personnel. An operational checklist will be prepared
                            for the senior officials to review the progress of South Vietnam. The
                            DCI pointed out that the Watch Committee has been assigned the task of
                            close attention to the possibility of a sudden <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> thrust. It was indicated that a Congressional Resolution
                            on Southeast Asia would probably not be desirable as the ground work
                            could not be laid prior to July and the debate might raise more trouble
                            than it would solve. If matters should indicate the real necessity for a
                            resolution, Congress could be called into Special Session.</p>
                        <p>1. The meeting opened with a discussion of the position the U.S. will
                            take with regard to overflights and escorts in Laos. After some
                            discussion, <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0208"/>between Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s position that we
                            should say that our missions were essentially reconnaissance but
                            authorized to return fire (with no specific reference to the June 9th
                            mission) and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s
                            concern that we be caught saying something that is not so, it was agreed
                            that the line to the press internationally will be “no comment with
                            respect to operations”, in support of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s strong plea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRJ1">Manning</persName> was directed to present an
                            agreed script to which all parties were instructed to adhere
                                (attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">Attached, but not
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The attached paper by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FMV1">Forrestal</persName> on “DeFuzing Laos”<note n="4" xml:id="d89fn4">See <ref target="#d89fn2">footnote 2</ref> above.</note> was then
                            reviewed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had trouble
                            with this paper's expression of our “objectives” in Laos, believing that
                            our real objectives are the complete withdrawal of the Viet Minh and
                            that they not use the corridor to South Vietnam, i.e. adherence to the
                            1962 Accords. He feared that if our “objectives” were only the
                            discouragement of the further Pathet Lao advances, there would be a bad
                            feeling in the pit of the stomach of the people we expect to withstand
                            Communist pressure in Southeast Asia, as this would be an abandonment of
                            our previous objectives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> argued that the discouragement of further
                            Pathet Lao grabs and the preservation of <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> were all we could practically hope for
                            at this time and that our program of action certainly does not contain
                            any steps to push the Pathet Lao back. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> thus made the point that our
                            stated objectives and our courses of action would be inconsistent, if
                            the former were the precondition of Pathet Lao withdrawal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> emphasized that our real objectives
                            must be to continue to press for the 1962 Accords and that our courses
                            of action must envisage the necessity to act militarily if the Pathet
                            Lao move to the Mekong, make a diplomatic effort to obtain the
                            pre-conditions of Pathet Lao withdrawal prior to any Geneva meeting and
                            endeavor at a conference to remove the Viet Minh from both Laos and the
                            corridor. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> brought
                            out that this rapidly brings up the problem of how much military
                            pressure we are prepared to use to obtain these. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> pointed out that there are
                            extensive international pressures pushing us towards Geneva even though
                            the pre-conditions may not be met. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DCD1">Dillon</persName> suggested that there might be two stages, interim
                            objectives and ultimate objectives. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then asked that he have an opportunity to revise
                            the paper and resubmit it.</p>
                        <p>3. In the course of this discussion it was agreed that there is little
                            evidence that the 9 June action had any impact on the Pathet Lao
                            assessment of what it is faced with. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> felt it would have little effect. Mr. <hi rend="italic">McNamara</hi> questioned whether the Pathet Lao could
                            be brought to move back from the Plaine des Jarres. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believed that it <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0209"/>might be possible to obtain movement of
                            this nature, in part by pressure on and by the Soviet Union, which has
                            an interest in defuzing the situation in Laos also.</p>

                        <p>1. The question, from one end of the world to the other, is quite clear:
                            Is the United States prepared to apply force to bring about Hanoi's
                            compliance with the Accords of 1954<note n="3" xml:id="d90fn3">The
                                Geneva Agreements of July 20 and 21, 1954, are printed in <ref target="frus1952-54v16">Foreign Relations, 1952–1954, vol.
                                    XVI</ref>, pp. 1505–1546.</note> and 1962 in both Laos and Viet
                            Nam? Behind this is the related question: Are we prepared to face any
                            level of escalation Hanoi and Peiping might mount in response to our
                            actions? Virtually no one doubts that we would react with force if there
                            was an attack on the Mekong Valley or across the seventeenth parallel,
                            initiated by the Communists. Virtually no one doubts that we are
                            prepared to stick it out in Viet Nam and Laos along present lines. What
                            is seen clearly, from Paris through Moscow east to Peiping, Hanoi,
                            Bangkok, etc. is:</p>
                        <p>a. Communist techniques of erosion in Southeast Asia, based on violation
                            of the 1954 and 1962 Accords, are working well and rendering
                            progressively less viable our present policy; and</p>
                        <p>b. We have evidently not made up our minds to apply force to bring about
                            Hanoi's compliance with the Accords of 1954 and 1962.</p>
                        <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>2. I can understand, of course, that a policy might be built around
                            avoiding or postponing that decision; but if the object of the exercise
                            is to maintain until November such confused anxiety in the Communist
                            camp as to keep Hanoi from launching a big offensive and sufficient hope
                            in Vientiane and Saigon as to avoid a total political collapse then: (a)
                            we should assess and the President should understand fully the risks
                            involved; (b) everyone around the table should be working consciously to
                            the same time-buying conception of the task; and (c) we should be
                            straining within the limits of that conception to do what we can within
                            our operational limitations, and without surrendering our ultimate
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>3. What struck me hard yesterday was that there was no common assessment
                            of either our ultimate or our operational objectives. The Forrestal
                                approach<note n="4" xml:id="d90fn4">Apparent reference to <ref target="#d87">Document 87</ref>.</note> assumed that we were
                            unprepared to apply virtually any force in Southeast Asia; and, in the
                            end, it confronted us with a formal split of Laos, involving an explicit
                            extension of Communist power and implicitly a legalization of the Viet
                            Minh presence in Laos which, given the character of any Lao border in a
                            split, I would regard as a disaster. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, on the other hand, evidently felt
                            (and I would agree) that the U.S. does have certain diplomatic leverage
                            and, if this is progressively backed at critical stages by a
                            demonstration of our willingness to use force, it might yield some
                            forward movement, while maintaining our ultimate objectives. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, on the other hand,
                            was asking for greater clarification about how much force we were
                            prepared to use before we started and committed ourselves to our
                            objectives; but he saw little hope that much force would be applied in
                            the coming months. With commendable candor, he insisted that our
                            statement of objectives be geared to our modest prospects, under the
                            circumstances he assumed as realistic.</p>
                        <p>4. The critical need, as I see it, is to assure ourselves that we are
                            working within a framework which is actually the one which the President
                            desires. This means that he must understand from us: (a) what the risks
                            are of political collapse in Vientiane and/or Saigon; (b) what the
                            consequences are of maintaining a declaratory policy in support of the
                            1954 and 1962 Accords, without in fact answering the central question.
                            This ambiguity has already cost us a good deal. It will certainly cost
                            us more; but under certain circumstances that cost might be more
                            acceptable to the President at the present time than the risks of a
                            confrontation with Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>5. The President should also be confronted not merely with our assessment
                            of the possible costs of a time-buying policy but also with a scenario
                            as fully worked out as we can of the type which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0211"/>apparently has in mind; that
                            is, one of holding firmly in diplomacy to the 1954 and 1962 Accords
                            while using all the elements of power we have available short of a
                            direct confrontation. I sensed yesterday some tendency to take the view
                            that unless we were prepared to go for a <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> Option Three (or <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>) policy, that we should operate pretty passively
                            with minimal defensive objectives with respect to both Vientiane and
                            Saigon. If we strain imaginatively along the lines, say, of Bill
                            Sullivan's memorandum of yesterday, there may emerge uses of force as a
                            counterpoint to diplomacy which would improve our position somewhat
                            without committing the President to a final confrontation. It is in this
                            area that I think we have to get consensus, assuming that the President
                            is not now ready for the direct confrontation.</p>
                        <p>6. I say all this while still believing that, as nearly as I can perceive
                            the situation, we are in fact taking risks in not having the
                            confrontation now, which outweigh the risks of the confrontation itself.
                            Moreover, I disagree with the view that a Congressional resolution would
                            be difficult to get if the President made up his mind that he needed it.
                            The Democrats would certainly back him, except for a few mavericks; the
                            Republicans would not oppose him, although they would be prepared to
                            exploit the consequences of failure as in any case they will exploit the
                            Southeast Asian situation during the campaign; and, until we publish the
                            Jorden Report,<note n="5" xml:id="d90fn5">The Jorden Report, formally
                                known as “Aggression From the North: The Record of North Viet-Nam's
                                Campaign to Conquer South Viet-Nam,” was released in February 1965
                                as Department of State publication 7839.</note> we will be
                            conducting diplomacy with at least one hand tied behind our backs. But
                            only the President can make that judgment.</p>
                        <p>7. In short, I believe we are caught in a vicious circle. Diplomacy can
                            only be truly effective once the President is committed to a
                            confrontation. What I fear now is that the ambiguity of our signals will
                            lead to a situation of desperation—based on the assessment that we are
                            not prepared for a confrontation—and that then (with Goldwater on our
                            flank) we shall be forced to act convulsively and with vastly more
                            bloodshed than if we had acted sooner.</p>
                        <p>8. As one who has been merely reading newspapers and cables on Southeast
                            Asia in recent weeks, I can only say that we have been conducting
                            propaganda as defined by F.M. Cornford: “that branch of the art of lying
                            which consists in very nearly deceiving your friends without quite
                            deceiving your enemies.”</p>

                            have come upon a device which may be just what we need during the
                            negotiations developing over Laos to show our determination. We have
                            almost established our intention to continue reconnaissance flights over
                            Laos on an as-needed basis with Souvanna's approval; and we have a good
                            public rationale for these flights, i.e. support of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and the Geneva Accords. This public
                            rationale would permit us to conduct reconnaissance not only over the
                            Plain of Jars, but also over the panhandle where evidence is
                            accumulating of significant Viet Cong buildups directed at Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>We should now develop in advance a number of specific targets both in the
                            panhandle and in the area east of the Plain of Jars, Ban Ban, and Nong
                            Het. We should pre-plan with the military as carefully as possible the
                            most precise kind of strike directed only at clearly military
                            targets.</p>
                        <p>We should put these plans on the shelf while we continue limited
                            reconnaissance (high-level in the dangerous areas) in order to maintain
                            the presence of aerial inspection. Then at appropriate times during the
                            course of the negotiations over the next few months, we should be ready
                            to pick one of our strike plans quickly off the shelf and put it into
                            rapid and effective execution in support of a diplomatic objective. I
                            believe and hope that the aftermath of Monday's action would show that
                            the Communists will have great difficulty mounting a public reaction to
                            a specific strike, if the target is entirely military and preferably
                            Viet Cong, since they cannot allow an international inspection without
                            admitting the presence of North Vietnamese military installations in
                            Laos.</p>

                        <p>The essence of this scheme is that we can control the timing and the
                            place of strike. This will require the greatest self-discipline and
                            coolness on the part of all agencies of the Government; but I think it
                            would permit us to maintain some pressure during the period of the next
                            several months.</p>

                        <p>1587. When I called on PriMin Souvanna this morning he told me he would
                            like reconnaissance flights begin again starting any time after tomorrow
                            morning. He asked me to say nothing to press about this today. I
                            indicated my satisfaction at his decision but noted that press were
                            expecting something today for sure, knowing that he and I were
                            discussing the matter; I also said I thought it would be more
                            appropriate if word came from him.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion Souvanna agreed and he will receive press late this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p>I then raised with him question of escorts and he said, while raising no
                            objection to employment of escorts, he wished nothing to be said about
                            this and to continue reply to question of protection by referring to use
                                <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s. Souvanna repeated his
                            arguments about necessity our playing this game in same way as
                            Communists to avoid giving them propaganda fuel, etc. I accepted his
                            points in principle but then reviewed two compelling reasons why we had
                            to continue to acknowledge use of escorts, namely (1) to assure
                            Congressional and public opinion that recon planes being adequately
                            protected and (2) by public mention of escorts to reinforce signal to
                            Hanoi and Peking which would not be as strong if we appeared be trying
                            to suppress this information. After much <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0214"/>discussion in which I drew liberally on helpful

                                Department suggested telling Souvanna that it was not a question of
                                pressure from the press that compelled the United States to
                                publicize escort operations, but “the necessity of maintaining basic
                                credibility vis-a-vis American public.” This had become a problem in
                                South Vietnam, and the Department wanted to avoid the problem in
                                Laos. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note>
                            Souvanna accepted my point.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna therefore said he will speak to press this afternoon along
                            following lines: He will say he has received new information on
                            Vietnamese infiltrations as result of which he has asked me to resume
                            reconnaissance flights. If he is queried about use of armed escorts he
                            will reply that he does not object to their use if the U.S. judges this
                            necessary for protection of recon planes.</p>
                        <p>I used this opportunity to mention that reports frequently received about
                            Pathet Lao/Viet Minh troop movements in South (citing what he had
                            earlier told me about possibility impending attack on Saravane) and
                            reports of supply convoys from North Viet-Nam. Could recon planes be
                            used also in that region if reports required verification? Souvanna
                            agreed.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna then volunteered that he wished make maximum use <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s to support <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces, to interdict supplies arriving over routes to
                            Xieng Khouang (No. 7) to Thakhek and Savannakhet (Nos. 8 and 12) and to
                            destroy on the ground what supplies Pathet Lao/Viet Minh have in place.
                            They must be so crippled that they will be able mount no further attacks
                            on <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces and so that possibly in
                            due course <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> may be able retake Plaine
                            des Jarres. He asked that my attaches be in touch with appropriate
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> officers to work out plans for
                                <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> program which will really
                            punish <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/Viet Minh. I told Souvanna of
                            Lao-American targeting group already in operation and other forms of
                            cooperation which I said we would be happy to augment.</p>
                        <p>Throughout our conversation Souvanna kept returning to theme “act but
                            don't talk about it”. He is very conscious of necessity maintain
                            internationally his neutral position and to maintain Geneva Accords.
                            There is no question in PriMin's mind that violations by Pathet Lao/Viet
                            Minh justify actions already underway and perhaps more but he insists
                            for political reasons that we must avoid going on record acknowledging
                            actions and thus giving Communists both propaganda fuel and pretexts.
                            Was able put over point that we could not deny use of escort planes but
                            he is quite opposed to our acknowledging that escorts firing or
                            attacking on Lao territory, even though he accepts that some of this may
                            be necessary.</p>

                            and keep Souvanna with us. I was vastly relieved to read first sentence
                                <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1176 and I believe our
                            discipline in this helped very much to save the day; Phillips has my
                            fullest sympathy and from reading <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1178,<note n="5" xml:id="d92fn5">Telegram 1178 to

                                (Ibid.)</note> I feel for his predicament. Souvanna's statement to
                            press this afternoon should take off good deal of heat on that score. I
                            must absolutely insist, however, that we stick to our line with regard
                            to questions about operations. If we are in real difficulties again from
                            press, let me try bring Souvanna around but let us avoid going contrary
                            his desires which, in many cases at least, can I believe be in due

                            thought was the target, and dropped their bombs. It is now clear that

                        <p>I attach a scenario prepared by Chet Cooper at <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>'s suggestion, on a
                            diplomatic track for Laos.<note n="2" xml:id="d94fn2">Attached, but not
                                printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Briefly, it proposes that we call an urgent Geneva Conference, confined
                            to Laos, and insist that it last only two weeks. Its purpose would be to
                            restore Geneva Accords. If the Conference failed, we should “take over
                            physical control of that part of Laos most important to us.”</p>
                        <p>This suggestion has two major flaws, in my opinion. We could never
                            convince our Asian allies that we could confine such a conference to a
                            two-week discussion on Laos, and I think they would be right.</p>
                        <p>Our purpose heretofore has been to drag things out. I don't think that
                            bringing the situation to a military head in two or three weeks is what
                            we want in this situation.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, how do we “take over” the Mekong Valley?</p>

                        <p>Concern was expressed about South Vietnamese morale and the need for
                            assurances of U.S. determination. There was some obscurity as to the
                            Country Team position on the eight province program which will be
                            clarified by further cables.</p>
                        <p>It was concluded that a Congressional Resolution is not now feasible but
                            that an effort is needed to develop a better base of understanding in
                            the Congress, and support of the Administration's policy, through
                            speeches. Part of this must come from an increase of third country
                            participation in the struggle in South Vietnam. It was agreed that a
                            contingency plan is needed for specific military reactions to possible
                            Pathet Lao or Viet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName> advances
                            in Laos. Additional escorted U.S. photo missions over Laos will be
                            authorized but will be run in a safer manner.</p>
                        <p>1. The meeting opened with a discussion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s 15 June paper on
                                Vietnam.<note n="2" xml:id="d95fn2">According to a June 15
                                memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                    Bundy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the purpose of this meeting was to
                                consider five papers. The principal question for discussion was
                                whether the group should recommend to the President that he seek a
                                Congressional resolution on Southeast Asia. A second question,
                                according to <persName>Bundy</persName>, was what action should be
                                suggested if a resolution was not recommended.
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>'s memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, its four papers, and one
                                supplemental paper, are in Foreign Relations, 1964–1968, vol. I, pp.
                                500–518.</note> This led to a rather inconclusive discussion of
                            South Vietnamese morale and the degree to which it was dependent upon a
                            conviction of U.S. determination to support Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow continued discussion of Vietnam, a possible Congressional
                            resolution, and <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s discussions
                            with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Vietnam.]</p>
                        <p>4. The meeting reviewed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName>'s attached paper on a policy without a
                            Congressional Resolution.<note n="3" xml:id="d95fn3">Dated June 15, the
                                paper was one of the five prepared for this meeting. (Ibid., pp.
                                516–518) It examined potential policy decisions if the United States
                                did not decide upon a Congressional resolution and major military
                                action against North Vietnam. Included as possible military actions
                                in Laos were reconnaissance, reconnaissance-strikes, <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations, and South Vietnamese
                                Air Force strikes in the Laos corridor. Political actions relating
                                to Laos included support for a diplomatic track, an effort to
                                sustain the Souvanna government by restraining the right-wing Lao
                                forces, and support for <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong
                                    Le</persName>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William
                                Bundy</persName> expressed the need for a scenario for appropriate
                            reactions to small scale Pathet Lao or Viet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName> advances, such as additional <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s at Udorn but with non-U.S. military
                            pilots. It was agreed that planners should meet for this purpose [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> also felt that a
                            contingency plan should be drawn up for the possible loss of <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0219"/>Saravane or Attopeu, which he thought
                            should be replied to by Vietnamese Air Force strikes in the corridor.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> recommended
                            that a specific plan be drawn up along this line and that at least
                            initial conversation on it be held with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> asked what the objective of such action
                            would be, whether to punish the Pathet Lao or to roll them back. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that the
                            purpose would be to slow the Pathet Lao advance and to assist South
                            Vietnamese morale. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            emphasized his concern over the absence of a contingency plan for our
                            reactions and that he felt the President should have a much better view
                            of what we are thinking of over the next two weeks. General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested that we try to define
                            what is meant by a “push to the Mekong”. With respect to the Polish
                            Conference Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            commented that we will try to drag it out, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> suggested that the
                            present indication is that one will not take place and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> expounded on the effort
                            he is making to bring it about. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> terminated this discussion by requesting that a
                            plan for reaction to specific military contingencies be staffed out.</p>
                        <p>5. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> then raised the
                            desirability of an additional photo mission over the Plaine des Jarres.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> said that <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommended a medium level (10,000 feet
                            above terrain) flight wherever weather permitted, for greater safety
                            against anti-aircraft. In the Plaine des Jarres and in other difficult
                            areas he recommended that there be no low level operations unless there
                            is a strong military or political reason. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> stated there is a political
                            motivation for a mission during this week but that this need not be in a
                            hot area; therefore he recommended a mission over Nape, escorted [sic].
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> believed that U.S.
                            jets over Laos provide a good political signal and he approved the Nape
                            idea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName> said
                            that we will at sometime have to return to the Plaine des Jarres or we
                            will not show the proper signal of strength but that is not an immediate
                                necessity.<note n="4" xml:id="d95fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> also prepared a
                                paper dated June 12—the second of the five papers—on the case for
                                the Congressional resolution entitled “Memorandum on Southeast
                                Asia,” which dealt primarily with Laos. Bundy noted that “now that
                                we have worked through the immediate problem of shooting down of our
                                aircraft over Laos and have <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                    Phouma</persName>'s clear understanding that reconnaissance
                                flights may continue over the Plaine des Jarres and 'South Laos' and
                                with escort as necessary, we should now draw back and examine the
                                total picture as it may develop in the next three to four months and

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> US Objectives in Laos</p>
                        <p>1. Recent events in Southeast Asia and current discussions in Washington
                            warrant a restatement of our objectives in Laos. Unless we have
                            consciously or sub-consciously modified our objectives, it is my
                            understanding that we continue to want: a Laos in which a genuinely
                            neutral and viable government effectively rules the country; a situation
                            in which neither the government nor the territory of Laos is used to
                            threaten the integrity or the internal stability of our two allies,
                            Thailand and South Vietnam. (It may be, of course, that the objective
                            circumstances in Southeast Asia, generally, and Laos, particularly, may
                            make these ambitious objectives impossible of achievement.)</p>
                        <p>2. Having stated our objectives, we should distinguish between them and
                            the means by which we choose to achieve them. We signed the Geneva
                            Accords in 1962 because we believed they provided a means, admittedly
                            imperfect, for the achievement of our objectives. They were not an end
                            in themselves. If the Geneva Accords are grossly and constantly violated
                            by the Communists, presumably we have to achieve our ends through other
                            means. The following scenario has been developed with this in mind.
                            Whether this scenario “fuses” or “de-fuses” the situation in Laos
                            depends as much on the Pathet Lao and the Viet Minh as it does on us.
                            (But this is true for almost anything we do short of large scale US
                            military attacks on North Vietnam on the one hand, or abandoning Laos on
                            the other.)</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Scenario</p>
                        <p>3. Whether it is explicitly stated or not, most, if not all of the
                            courses of action recently developed with respect to Laos wind up in
                            Geneva by one route or another. Since our own case with respect to
                            observing the Geneva Accords is better now than it is likely to be as
                            time goes on, our position might be best served by taking strong, even
                            self-righteous, initiatives for an early Geneva conference. Rather than
                            being dragged to <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0221"/>one kicking
                            and screaming as if we were the defendant, we should notify the two
                            co-chairmen that we insist that a conference be held as soon as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>4. Our preconditions should not be a pull-back of the Pathet Lao from the
                            Plaine des Jarres (we won't get it anyway), but rather: that the
                            conference be confined to Laos; that it be directed exclusively to a
                            restoration of the Geneva Accords; and that it last only two to three
                            weeks. We should further insist, not only that the forms of the Geneva
                            agreement be restored, but that they be adequately and effectively
                            policed by a reconstituted <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. As implied above, our posture at such a conference should be tough and
                            aggressive, taking advantage of our good case and of the split in the
                            ranks of the Communist Bloc.</p>
                        <p>6. Unless our terms were met in the time period prescribed, we should
                            indicate that we plan to achieve the objectives sought in the Geneva
                            Accords by unilateral moves. While we need not be specific as to what we
                            mean by this, we should provide ample evidence of our intent to move
                            militarily.</p>
                        <p>7. If in fact the Geneva Accords are not reconstituted at this
                            conference, we should move into that part of Laos most important to us
                            (along the South Vietnamese and Thai borders and into the key Mekong
                            River towns). We should then emphasize our readiness to reconvene at
                            Geneva and, upon a satisfactory agreement there, our willingness to
                            remove our forces. We should point to Lebanon as an example of our
                            sincerity.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Accompanying Moves</p>
                        <p>8. Obviously, we should undertake, on a crash basis, the necessary
                            arrangements for moving into Laos, hopefully within hours after the
                            breakup of a Geneva Conference.</p>
                        <p>9. We should also make sure that necessary steps are taken to prevent the
                            rightists from taking over the government in Vientiane, during
                            Souvanna's absence. Alternatively, we should work out with Souvanna some
                            way for him to be represented at Geneva without his having to leave
                            Vientiane.</p>
                        <p>10. While all of these moves are taking place, we should proceed with
                            despatch to strengthen the position of the South Vietnamese government
                            along the lines we have already worked out. We should also endeavor to
                            avoid discussing the Vietnamese problem in any international forum until
                            the Laos situation is resolved—by which time substantial results should
                            have been achieved from our efforts in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>11. Finally, we should proceed with our program of explaining to the
                            American people what we seek in Laos and South Vietnam and the
                            importance of maintaining a non-Communist position there.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Some Caveats and Some Cautions</p>
                        <p>12. In the last analysis, US objectives in Laos (and in South Vietnam)
                            can be achieved only if the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is
                            somehow induced to stand down its assistance to and direction of the
                            anti-government forces. There are three main, conceivably inter-related,
                            approaches toward accomplishing this: Hanoi might be persuaded in
                            multilateral negotiations or by some direct deal; or Hanoi might be
                            forced to yield by military means.</p>
                        <p>13. The scenario above proceeds basically down the negotiating track. It
                            has many advantages (taking the negotiating initiative, meeting the
                            desires of certain western allies and neutrals, seizing control of the
                            time-table for Laos and Vietnam, exploiting present Sino-Soviet
                            difficulties, demonstrating US strength of purpose). But it also
                            presents many problems (the Thai and South Vietnamese concern about any
                            Geneva Conference, the danger of a Rightist coup in Laos, the risk of
                            the Communists fuzzing and indefinitely extending the Conference, the
                            problems in moving US military units into Laos). Whether this course is
                            one that should be pursued depends on the netting out of the advantages
                            and the disadvantages and also on the promise that other courses
                            hold.</p>
                        <p>14. A scenario for a direct deal with Hanoi has yet to be developed and
                            will not be further discussed here. Although large scale military action
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> has been discarded, at
                            least temporarily, there are many lesser military actions now under
                            consideration. In considering the effectiveness of contemplated US
                            measures to force the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> into
                            compliance, the French experience in the early 1950's provides some
                            perspective. By 1954 the French Expeditionary Force in Vietnam consisted
                            of about 135,000 French and Foreign Legion forces. In addition, the
                            French High Command had under its control 221,000 organized Vietnamese
                            troops (about 160 battalions), 120,000 auxiliaries and many thousand of
                            “suppletifs” roughly equivalent to the present SDC). By the end of the
                            war, French air strength included 150 combat aircraft (plus another 50
                            from the aircraft carrier Arromanches) and about 80 transport
                            planes.</p>
                        <p>15. This is not meant to imply that we couldn't defeat the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> with the same or even smaller forces.
                            But it does indicate that reconnaissance flights (escorted or not),
                            small teams of infiltrators, small-scale bombing (<gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>) of targets in Laos and even in North Vietnam are not
                            likely to frighten Hanoi into complying with US demands. US Force
                            movements will cause some breast-beating and shrill propaganda
                            reactions, but even these are not likely to have much deterrent effect
                            until they are actually used.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> US Objectives—Another Look</p>
                        <p>16. The courses of action discussed above and many others, as well,
                            relate to the US objectives spelled out in Paragraph 1. But, are we
                            deluding ourselves? Should we lower our sights to a more realistic set
                            of <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0223"/>goals—more realistic in
                            terms of our ability to achieve them with courses of action carrying
                            less risk and smaller commitments? The fact is that some courses of
                            action currently under consideration subsume objectives substantially
                            more modest than those we thought we would attain through the Geneva
                            Accords. For example, the idea of letting the situation in Laos stew
                            along until and unless the Pathet Lao pushed down the Mekong has its
                            attractions, but we should not pursue this course unless we are ready to
                            adjust our objectives. In short, we must put the cart and horse in their
                            proper places: Let us decide, first, what our current objectives are and
                            then work out the scenarios for achieving them. Not vice-versa.</p>

                            that such meeting will ever come about or, if it does, will last long.

                        <p>2. We should not be too certain that our various “signals”, political and
                            military, to the Communists will really deter them. If they believe
                            their vital interests (which in their view might include (a) control of
                            substantial parts of Laos and/or (b) demonstration of success for
                            revolutionary insurgent movements), are threatened, they will react on

                            of course have the capability of substantially increased ground
                            commitment in northern and eastern Laos. We should watch closely for
                            their “signals”. Remember Korean precedent.</p>
                        <p>3. We should, if and when necessary, be prepared to occupy and hold the
                            Laotian river towns, at least from Vientiane south. Any attempt to
                            occupy and hold with American troops the Plaine des Jarres and Luang
                            Prabang would be extremely hazardous and seriously risk involving
                            ourselves in Dien Bien Phus. We should be under no illusion that we can
                            drive the Communists out of Laos by military action, but we can hold
                            them approximately where they are and make their presence increasingly
                            costly to them.</p>
                        <p>4. The best means of combatting Communist military action in Laos is
                            certainly by air strikes. Strikes by <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s seem much more effective and useful than aerial
                            reconnaissance with armed escorts. Except to the degree really necessary
                            for intelligence purposes, the latter involves US prestige openly
                            without adequate benefit and obliges us to react to losses by action we
                            might prefer not to take. Air strikes by “Laotian” planes really do a
                            job and serve just as well to get a “signal” across.</p>
                        <p>5. Even “Laotian” air strikes and useful air reconnaissance may bring
                            about (a) increased Viet Minh and perhaps ChiCom intervention on the
                            ground and (b) heavier pressure from friends and neutrals for a Geneva
                            Conference. These possibilities must be kept in mind but should not
                            deter us from air action as long as Communist pressure on the ground
                            continues.</p>
                        <p>6. As to Vietnam, it is assumed attack by ground forces north of the 17th
                            parallel would be counterproductive. If the time comes for overt
                            military action in North Vietnam, would it not be feasible for air
                            strikes to be carried out by “South Vietnamese” planes? Direct avowed US
                            participation would almost oblige the ChiComs to respond in some very
                            substantial way. As to targets, new factories, on which the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>'s hopes for industrial development
                            rest, would be the most impressive loss they could suffer, but these are
                            presumably close to centers of population and should be targets for
                            sabotage rather than air attack. Ports would pre- sumably involve ships
                            of other nations. Lines of communication, though somewhat insubstantial
                            in Southeast Asia, would probably be as productive as any feasible
                            target.</p>

                            <item>Meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in his office on 17 June, 4:00 to

                        <p>1. We exchanged views on Southeast Asia and both were in agreement on the
                            following scenario in which political and military actions would
                            parallel one another:</p>
                        <p>With respect to political action, we agreed:</p>
                        <p>a. Polish proposal seemed dim in view of the attitude of Peiping, Hanoi,
                            Souvannavong and now Moscow. Furthermore, State believes that the
                            advantage of the Polish proposal as a means of separating Moscow from
                            Peiping seemed questionable.</p>
                        <p>b. We probably had to go through the United Nations but it would not be
                            productive.</p>
                        <p>c. We would end up in Geneva and it was probably better for us to move
                            progressively towards Geneva charging the Communists with violations of
                            the '54 and '62 Agreement instead of being hauled in and put in the
                            defender's box</p>
                        <p>As these diplomatic efforts proceeded, we should continue to make
                            preparations for extended military operations along the following
                            lines:</p>
                        <p>a. Do all possible to reinforce <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName>'s base.</p>
                        <p>b. Intensify the Vietnam information service.</p>
                        <p>c. Face up to the probability of the early replacement of <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> and select a proper Ambassador.
                            In this regard, many names were mentioned but none agreed to.</p>
                        <p>d. Continue occasional reconnaissance flights and continue the <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> bombing missions out of Vientiane. It
                            was recognized the latter will become increasingly vulnerable as
                            anti-aircraft guns are installed in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>e. Release <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> to bomb Laotian
                            corridor.</p>
                        <p>f. Deploy ground, air and military units so that they can be placed in
                            appropriate places in Laos and elsewhere in minimum time if decision is
                            reached to extend north.</p>
                        <p>Concurrently we should probe every way of obtaining a Congressional
                            Resolution. We recognized a Resolution was necessary. The difficulties
                            of getting it were also recognized, however the prospect of committing
                            U.S. forces to action in Southeast Asia made a Congressional Resolution
                            almost mandatory.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> expressed himself as
                            feeling that as a result of the Honolulu meeting and other information,
                            he did not feel the immediate dangers were as serious as he had thought.
                            He did not agree with <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> or
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> that things
                            would “jog along and get better.” He thought they would get worse, but
                            not collapse. I said I was not quite that sanguine, that I felt some
                            unexpected situation might occur which would confront us with a severe
                            crisis unexpectedly.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Text of oral message:</p>
                        <p>You are already aware from my talks here with Ambassador Drozniak<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2">An account of one of these talks on June 9 is
                                in a memorandum of conversation, June 9. (Ibid.)</note> before his
                            departure of my deep concern over the situation in Laos and my hope that
                            the constructive Polish proposal for six-nation consultations could lead
                            to improvement.</p>
                        <p>As you know, the US subscribed to the 1962 Geneva Accords on Laos, and we
                            have no other object in Laos than to see them observed. We want no
                            bases, no military presence nor any other special position in that
                            country. It seems to me self-evident that, if all foreigners would
                            simply leave Laos and let the Lao run their own affairs, Laos could be
                            at peace and would create no problem for any of its neighbors. The
                            Accords of 1962 in fact reflected this view.</p>
                        <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0227"/>
                        <p>In a broader sense, I think Your Excellency will agree that the 1962
                            Accords also held out hope that agreement on difficult political
                            questions could be reached between Communists and non-Communists and
                            faithfully carried out despite ideological differences. The violations
                            of the Accords by the Hanoi regime thus call into question whether two
                            different political systems can find ways to live in peace with each
                            other and devote themselves to the betterment of their own peoples. For
                            I must say to Your Excellency most solemnly that unless Hanoi and Peking
                            leave their neighbors alone, the prospects for peace in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> are dim.</p>
                        <p>Because the developing situation seemed to me so ominous, I was
                            especially glad to see the Polish initiative calling for six-power
                            consultations. It is our hope that these consultations can be held. The
                            grouping your Government had suggested seemed to us particularly
                            appropriate for the discussion of necessary measures to improve the
                            military and political situation, without which it remains our strong
                            feeling that no purpose could be served by a wider 14-nation
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>We have of course noted the adverse comments on your proposal by the
                            regime in Peking, and also by the Pathet Lao faction within Laos. We
                            believe that the comments of Peking simply underscore the desirability
                            of a smaller grouping that would be in a better position to ascertain
                            the facts in a clear and objective manner and to take measures to
                            restore the situation. As to the Pathet Lao position, we do not
                            interpret anything they have said as a firm rejection of your proposal,
                            and we believe that if an invitation could be promptly issued they would
                            in fact be under great pressure to attend.</p>
                        <p>I recognize, of course, that there are various questions of fact
                            concerning what has taken place in Laos not merely in the last month but
                            over a period of nearly two years. There has not always been
                            acknowledgment of what we have regarded as clear Pathet Lao and Viet
                            Minh violations on the part of the non-Communist factions. Yet there
                            should be no difference between us about the facts, and the Co-Chairmen
                            and members of the International Control Commission are in a peculiarly
                            strong position to establish exactly what has taken place.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I should like to stress again my Government's desire for a
                            peaceful solution of the problem. As you know, we have recently supplied
                            additional military aircraft to the Government of National Union in Laos
                            at its express request, and have similarly engaged in reconnaissance
                            operations, which we believe to be entirely justified in view of the
                            military activity taking place and the inability of the International
                            Control Commission to discharge its functions in areas under Pathet Lao
                            control. In short, the limited measures we have taken have been made
                            necessary by the persistent violations of the Geneva Accords of 1962 by
                            the Pathet Lao and by Hanoi. So long as these gross violations continue,
                            it has seemed necessary for us to let Hanoi know that the <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0228"/>engulfment of Laos will not be
                            accepted. Our purpose remains the fulfillment of the Accords of 1962,
                            and the withdrawal of all foreign influence from Laos as those Accords
                            intended. End text of oral message.</p>
                        <p>You should accompany this by amplification along lines previous telegrams

                        <p>b) Change last sentence fifth paragraph to read: “As to the Pathet Lao

                            your proposal, and we had thought that if an intervention were promptly

                        <p>As for military situation itself I feel there is still a dichotomy
                            between on one hand U.S. action such as escorted recce flights taken on
                            U.S. initiative to encourage friends and give clear sign our
                            determination to Communists, and on other hand U.S. military help
                            directly related to immediate threat which <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> armed forces currently face. Military action latter
                            category would include range of actions from use Air America pilots in
                                <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s, through employing <gloss target="#t_SAW1">SAW</gloss> detachment, through use U.S. jet

                        <p>I realize that over past several weeks U.S. action dictated more by need
                            demonstrate clearly to Commies our posture, through such actions as June
                            9 bombing, thus supporting over-all Lao position, and less by
                            consideration of direct assistance to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces. Whether this phase is past no doubt depends on
                            our assessment of effect these actions have had on Communists. I
                            recommend in any case that in future we seek to relate our military
                            action more directly to military efforts <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. This could include not only graduated actions noted
                            above which would be undertaken in response to Communist initiatives,
                            but might also include “suppressive action” to cut Route 7 at favorable
                            locations east of Khang Khay, to prevent <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM build-up for attack on Muong Soui now reportedly
                            underway and to support neutralist push north from Vang Vieng to take
                            Sala Phou Khoun (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1673).<note n="5" xml:id="d100fn5">Dated June 22. (Ibid.)</note> The more our

                            and neutralist forces, the better performance those forces likely to
                            turn in and the greater morale boost to free Laos. Seems to me also our
                            actions along these lines will demonstrate our <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0230"/>intentions to Communists every bit as
                            clearly as proposed “suppressive action” on Khang Khay (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1146 to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, 1675 to Dept).<note n="6" xml:id="d100fn6">Dated June 22. (Ibid.)</note> How long such
                            initiatives would go on would depend on whether we seeking stabilize

                        <p>If U.S. military actions are to serve our political as well as military
                            objectives, then I must be able work out each new step with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> so that we can count on
                            his support of, or better his request for, each action undertaken in
                            cases where such action publicly acknowledged. He and I must be able
                            count on Washington silence in those cases, should they arise in future,
                            where he insists on maintaining secrecy about U.S. involvement (and I am
                            unable dissuade him from this) and we decide nevertheless to go ahead
                            with action under his conditions. We must avoid instances in future
                            where Souvanna has agreed to our action in Laos on condition it not be
                            publicly acknowledged, and we nevertheless proceed to acknowledge it; in
                            such cases we must not proceed with action if public acknowledgement
                            deemed inevitable. <gloss target="#t_septel1">Septel</gloss> will
                            provide some further observations on <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1220 (notal).<note n="7" xml:id="d100fn7">Not
                                further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>While recce flights in my mind need not involve us in questions of Geneva
                            Accords, escort by fighters certainly begins to and employment those
                            fighters in response to ground fire, to say nothing of “suppressive
                            avion”, raises question in most active form. This also true, of course,
                            of use Air America or Thai pilots, <gloss target="#t_SAW1">SAW</gloss>
                            detachment, to say nothing of U.S. fighter bombers supporting ground
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>In U.S. public statements we have by now pretty well acknowledged some of
                            these actions which are clearly in violation of Accords and justified
                            them on grounds clear and continuous violation by Communists of Accords
                            releases us from our obligations. At same time Department appears
                            nervous about any acknowledgment that Air America involved in
                            maintenance T–28's in Udorn even though we have had to use Air America
                            planes liberally in moving troops and munitions to and from areas such
                            as Ban Na and Muong Soui where there are no aircraft which Lao can fly
                            which can do the job. I understand of course we should avoid our
                            involvement unnecessarily in actions which could be interpreted as
                            violations but I am unclear as to our position on prohibited actions
                            which are indispensable or at least very difficult to avoid in
                            supporting <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military effort.
                            Initially I had also assumed that publicity about our actions would take
                            this question into account, and we would seek avoid public
                            acknowledgment of actions violating Geneva Accords, such as escort
                            fighters responding to ground fire; however this evidently not
                            Department's position and therefore I would appreciate <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0231"/>guidance as to position we should take
                            with regard to Geneva Accords and our continuing to be bound by their
                            provisions.</p>
                        <p>With respect to possible use of Thai ground forces which briefly
                            discussed Udorn June 19 with Amb <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and Generals Milton and Moore and Admiral Miller,
                            I strongly recommend that planning on this point be closely correlated
                            with planning for graduated responses and use of recce flights, etc.
                            discussed above.</p>
                        <p>Answers to questions posed above also essential if I am to be able
                            effectively respond to RLG questions or stimulate <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> action concerning employment <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and neutralist forces. Reply to Kong Le
                            about offensive northward on Route 13 relatively clear-cut but we may
                            one day be faced with proposal, for example, for counteroffensive to
                            retake Plaine des Jarres with American air support, an action which
                            would certainly convey to Communists clear picture of our involvement
                            but which might also invite much heavier response from Communist side
                            than we are now anxious to have stimulated. I need to know whether to
                            discourage, acquiesce in, or seek to stimulate such a move.</p>
                        <p>In light questions raised above would appreciate guidance soonest
                            concerning (1) what we aim to accomplish in Laos by military action in

                                Army Attaché in Vientiane reported on a June 23 meeting with the Lao
                                General Staff and Souvanna to discuss a <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> offensive against Pathet Lao strongholds at the
                                junction of Routes 7 and 13 north of Vientiane and west of the Plain
                                of Jars. The ultimate objective of this extensive three-pronged
                                offensive would be to relieve pressure on Muong Soui. (Department of

                            answer all points reference message, following are main lines of our
                            present thinking:</p>
                        <p>1. In absence major communist military moves in Laos or developments with
                            respect <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> compelling major policy
                            change, our military actions in immediate period ahead, insofar as they
                            concern Laos, should be selected with a view to (a) deterring further
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM moves; (b) bolstering morale
                            and capacity non-communist forces; (c) keeping Souvanna in office and
                            bolstering his position; and (d) maintaining US freedom of action. We do
                            not envisage supporting efforts to drive communists back in <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> or elsewhere if this would require
                            major action.</p>
                        <p>2. It is in line with this general approach that we have been more
                            forthcoming in publicity about recce flights while reluctant to admit
                            involvement in <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations. Fact is
                            that former are necessarily more visible here and elsewhere and that we
                            have been taking firm and consistent line both in public and with
                            important third countries that we are not directly involved in <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations. On this basis, believe we
                            can make out sound case that we are not violating Geneva Accords for
                            reasons set out <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1174.<note n="3" xml:id="d101fn3">In telegram 1174 to Vientiane, June 16, the

                                designed to provide the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and the
                                Royal Lao Government with information on North Vietnamese-Pathet Lao

                                <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s or <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0233"/>employment of <gloss target="#t_SAW1">SAW</gloss> detachment, for example, could not be so defended and
                            would be unwise unless need was truly critical.</p>
                        <p>3. We recognize importance of remaining in step with Prime Minister in
                            terms both explaining actions we take and protecting and strengthening
                            his position vis-à-vis conservative generals. At moment it seems there
                            may be more danger Souvanna getting out in front of us than vice versa.
                            Particularly relevant is his presentation proposed three-pronged attack
                            on <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> in area junction routes 7 and 13
                                (<gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> CX–291) “with maximum US
                            support to include use American pilots with <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s and armed US recce.” Along lines our present
                            thinking we are not prepared use US pilots in <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s although air lift activities and reconnaissance
                            support within existing guidelines quite acceptable.</p>
                        <p>4. More basically, our first reaction is that operation on scale outlined
                                <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> CX–291, involving as it does
                            movement of forces from already threatened Attopeu area and complex
                            maneuvers with air support, runs extremely serious risk outright defeat
                            in view past experience <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>. Even if
                            operation were relatively sure of success it would be out of line with
                            basic stance we wish maintain at this time (see para 1 above). As we see
                            it, proposed operation would not really contribute to relieve Muong Soui
                            situation but apparently aimed to achieve psychological lift of victory.
                            We also not clear just how this planning has been arrived at or whether
                            Kong Le and Amkha are really in accord on this concept.</p>
                        <p>5. We not clear just how serious threat to Muong Soui is but are planning
                            medium-level recce operation there for 26th or 27th and preparing plans
                            for further low-level operations if required. From here it looks as
                            though assets now proposed to be devoted to CX–291 operation could be
                            much better employed strengthening defenses of Muong Soui.
                            Alternatively, we would think preservation neutralist forces in secure
                            position more important than retaining foothold in <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>. There may well be merit in evacuation
                            neutralist forces to Vang Vieng area as Amkha originally urged.</p>
                        <p>6. In any event, it would certainly help if Souvanna could publicize
                            threat to Muong Soui and provide additional basis justifying possible
                            extensive low-level recce operations if required. If Muong Soui actually
                            attacked, we probably prepared, along lines <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1613,<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">See <ref target="#d100fn3">footnote 3, Document 100</ref>.</note> to
                            authorize US civilian pilots fly <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s,
                            but had not thought we could go further than this in response this
                            particular action.</p>
                        <p>7. Realize above if communicated to Souvanna might sharply deflate his
                            present rather ebullient mood and perhaps endanger his position with
                            conservative military leaders. If we conclude we should discourage
                            CX–291 operation, line we would propose would be to say that <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0234"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces not yet ready for such
                            ambitious undertaking but that we prepared to take substantial measures
                            to beef them up further. Among these could be:</p>
                        <p>a. Furnishing additional <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s. We
                            exploring this urgently.</p>
                        <p>b. Additional Thai pilots and perhaps other forms of Thai volunteers
                            greatly expanding present limited Thai elements with RLG forces. In this
                            connection, Bangkok should explore in wake of Milton talks just where
                            Thai do stand with respect such additional efforts.</p>
                        <p>c. Whatever else you recommend except that for present we would not
                            consider introducing US military personnel in any capacity for reasons
                            stated para 2 above.</p>
                        <p>8. Above reasoning also means we should certainly not encourage any
                            military move to recapture <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> areas
                            themselves. Obviously, what we have is serious problem of maintaining
                            Souvanna and <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> morale while
                            restraining them from unwise military action and while we pursue
                            negotiating track. Believe we can do a lot within present guidelines but
                            we are most reluctant to go further in the direction of US involvement
                            at this time. Our essential effort is to use negotiating track to build
                            up Souvanna position and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> role and to
                            frame and isolate withdrawal issue while putting this off for
                            significant period to avoid premature crisis.</p>
                        <p>For Bangkok: Re Para 7 b above, request you explore immediately Thai
                            willingness supply additional pilots for <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s on same basis pilots already with <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>. For longer term, we wish explore

                            support the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> for a short period. A
                            sustained effort would require augmentation of the Udorn assets.</p>

                        <p>e. <hi rend="italic">Base Capacity</hi>. In view of the present inability
                            to fly operational missions from Thailand, base loading in Laos would be
                            a critical limitation. Careful planning between operational missions,
                            maintenance flow back to Udorn and minimum ground time at Vientiane
                            would be an absolute necessity.</p>
                        <p>f. <hi rend="italic">Implications of Using Non-Lao Pilots</hi>. The use
                            of non-Lao pilots presents the risk of disclosure of intervention. There
                            are problems now in preserving the cover of Thais participating in
                                <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations.</p>
                        <p>g. <hi rend="italic">A–1H Aircraft</hi>. The use of A–1H aircraft by
                            either <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> or US pilots would raise
                            the problem of detracting from the war effort in the RVN. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> reports he doubts that the
                            present basic qualifications of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> pilots permits them to become combat pilots in the
                            A–1H aircraft.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that in any augmentation plan the
                            four <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> aircraft of the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>

                            <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> pilots, and that efforts be made to
                            encourage the Thais to provide the required additional assets.</p>

                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the proposed Laos offensive
                            as reported by the Army Attaché, Vientiane (<gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> Vientiane CX 291, <gloss target="#t_DTG1">DTG</gloss>
                                231350Z),<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">See <ref target="#d101fn2">footnote 2, Document 101</ref>.</note> to clear out the Pathet
                            Lao/Viet Minh (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM) <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0237"/>along Route 13 from Vang Vieng to Sala
                            Phou Khoun and to relieve the pressure on Muong Soui. Recognizing that
                            there are certain risks involved when operations in Laos are concerned,
                            they consider the operation desirable in the circumstances.</p>
                        <p>2. Insofar as support operations are concerned, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            have determined:</p>
                        <p>a. The additional airlift aircraft (three <gloss target="#t_C1231">C–123</gloss> and three Caribou), estimated by the Ambassador to be
                            required (Vientiane to State 1694, 25 June 1964),<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                POL 27 LAOS)</note> can be made available from <gloss target="#t_PACOM1">PACOM</gloss> resources with no appreciable
                            effect on the air effort in South Vietnam. When the requirement has been
                            firmly established, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will direct <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to lend these aircraft to Air
                            America at Udorn and to support them as required.</p>
                        <p>b. Necessary logistic support for ground and air operations is available
                            in the <gloss target="#t_Westpac1">WESTPAC</gloss> area.</p>
                        <p>c. Fifteen <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s have been made available
                            from resources in the Republic of Vietnam. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2
                                lines of source text not declassified</hi>] Should the operation be
                            approved, Air America pilots should be authorized to fly <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> aircraft as necessary to exploit
                            available aircraft and assist in maximizing the effectiveness of the air
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>3. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has been given authority to use
                            napalm in the defense of Muong Soui. They further recommend that Lao
                            pilots be authorized to employ this munition when it is considered
                            optimum for the attack of military targets.</p>
                        <p>4. One of the most important measures to strengthen coordinated
                            air-ground operations and increase the effectiveness of the air effort
                            in Laos would be establishment of an effective air control system. The
                            Air Attaché has reported (<gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> Laos
                            CX–300, <gloss target="#t_DTG1">DTG</gloss> 242001Z)<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">Not found.</note> that due to factional
                            difficulties there are major problems in establishing such a system
                            using either <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> or Neutralist ground
                            force components. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s views
                            have been requested; subsequent to their receipt, the recommendations of
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be submitted to you.</p>
                        <p>5. Associated with both the defense of Muong Soui and the proposed Laos
                            offensive are requirements for reconnaissance flights over Routes 7 and
                            13. These are being handled separately and should be supported on a
                            timely basis.</p>
                        <p>6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize the possibility that the attack
                            envisaged by the plan could result in (1) a complete failure caused by
                            the collapse of the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/Neutralist
                            forces with subsequent <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM attacks
                            toward the Mekong, or (2) an increase in the support of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM forces in Laos to include possible
                            active intervention by regular North Vietnamese forces. In this
                            connection, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recognize <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0238"/>that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM forces in Laos could attack toward the Mekong in any
                            event. Therefore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that, as
                            concomitant actions to the Laos offensive, preparations be made for
                            actions in the priority listed below:</p>
                        <p>a. US air strikes against appropriate <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM targets in Laos.</p>
                        <p>b. Defense of the key cities along the Mekong utilizing Thai forces and
                            such US forces as may be necessary in accordance with <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> OPLAN 32–64, Phase
                                II—Laos.<note n="5" xml:id="d103fn5">Not found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>c. Air attacks against targets in North Vietnam to destroy the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will and capabilities as necessary to
                            compel the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to cease support of the
                            insurgencies in South Vietnam and Laos (Appendix).<note n="6" xml:id="d103fn6">Attached, but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. In summary, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. The United States support the plan for relieving pressure on and
                            providing for the defense of Muong Soui, by</p>
                        <p>(1) Providing three additional <gloss target="#t_C1231">C–123</gloss> and
                            three additional Caribou aircraft, subsequent to further validation of
                            the requirement for such aircraft;</p>
                        <p>(2) Providing necessary logistic support for the planned air and ground
                            operations;</p>
                        <p>(3) Authorizing Air America pilots to fly <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> aircraft in support of the operation as required;</p>
                        <p>(4) Authorizing the use of napalm against appropriate military targets;
                            and</p>
                        <p>(5) Providing reconnaissance support, as requested by Vientiane, on a
                            timely basis.</p>
                        <p>b. The United States prepare the necessary forces for contingency
                            operations in Southeast Asia in the following priority:</p>
                        <p>(1) Air strikes by US aircraft against appropriate <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM targets in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(2) Defense of the Mekong cities, using appropriate US forces in
                            conjunction with Thai forces.</p>
                        <p>(3) Low-level reconnaissance and air strikes by US aircraft against
                            appropriate targets in North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>8. The Joint Chiefs of Staff request that the above views, and those
                            expressed in the Appendix hereto be given due consideration in the
                            current State-Defense discussions.</p>

                            is sound and that operation has reasonable chance of success. At same
                            time we would stress that operation must be undertaken by <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> on own responsibility and with clear

                        <p>2. Souvanna must recognize that initiation of operation in itself
                            probably increases possibility major Communist attack against Neutralist
                            forces in Muong Soui. If such attack takes place, he must recognize that
                            Muong Soui itself cannot be held even with extensive US air operations
                            (problems of which set forth below) and that in this event we would
                            strongly urge that Neutralist forces be in position to move west from
                            Muong Soui seeking to link up with forces from Vang Vieng and Luang
                            Prabang to establish firm and consolidated <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>-controlled area. We believe sacrifice Muong Soui area

                            character. We would take this line ourselves and assume that Souvanna
                            would do likewise. Both of us should constantly reiterate our objective
                            is preservation Geneva Accords. As your 1716<note n="5" xml:id="d104fn5">Dated June 27. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27

                            in support this rationale, and if this operation becomes known we and
                            Souvanna should certainly publicize on basis assisting in defense Muong
                            Soui and forces there.</p>
                        <p>4. We are prepared to furnish additional <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s promptly [1–1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified] we do not believe US civilian pilots required for <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s in support of operation. However, US
                            is prepared to use existing Air America aircraft, provide additional

                            permit use of US civilian pilots to bring GM–16 up to Muong Soui and to
                            provide continuing resupply of operation as required. (Our public and
                            third-country position would be that the operation is mercenary Air
                            America and not US Government and that, in any event, the operation
                            relates directly to defense of Neutralist forces along lines para 3
                            above.) <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: We also considering

                            engineers and supplies to conduct land-mining operations and also Thai

                        <p>6. We prepared also to conduct added reconnaissance in operational area
                            as necessary prior its initiation. (Operations of 27 June produced only
                            10 percent results as you know.) <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>: We

                            reconnaissance should be preceded by suppression strikes. Request your

                        <p>We have noted your telecon request that in this event we authorize US
                            civilian pilots in <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s and also
                            direct US Navy and <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> strikes against
                            forces attacking Muong Soui. [1–1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified] As to US air strikes (with or without “reconnaissance”
                            cover) our view is that such action would not enable Muong Soui position
                            to be held and would also be very difficult to conduct unless we had
                            effective airground control in being.</p>
                        <p>Basically, we are concerned that Souvanna may have excessive view of what
                            air can accomplish in this situation, and we reluctant get into
                            large-scale US air strike operation that would in fact be militarily
                            ineffective in countering the attack itself. At best we see any
                            additional action at this point as being effort permit Neutralist forces
                            withdraw and re-group in orderly fashion in accordance with para A(2)
                            above.</p>
                        <p>However, we would consider what would in effect be series of punitive air
                            attacks against <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> military targets in
                                <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> and Route 7 areas. This would be
                            designed punish other side and show our continued determination but
                            avoid committing our air to vain attempt hold Muong Soui. We need to
                            know how extensive punitive strikes you recommend.</p>
                        <p>On diplomatic front we would in any event continue to urge Polish
                            proposals and to oppose Geneva conference both if operation takes place
                            and if Muong Soui attacked. In latter event, we would contemplate urging
                            Souvanna take his case to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> although we
                            do not have any hope Security Council would vote for withdrawal or
                            anything more than ceasefire. If outcome appeared likely be indecisive,
                            we might, with him, avoid any formal appeal for action but at least use
                            Security Council as platform dramatize continued Communist offensives
                            and stress our adherence Geneva Accords and justification actions we
                            would have taken and continuation such actions in response Communist
                            action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">C. If Neutralist and <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces gravely threatened and disorganized.</p>
                        <p>Possibility must be faced that operation goes badly and/or Communist

                            forces to make a new government-held area along Route 13 and a small
                            part of Route 7. In this event we would again consider penalty bombings
                            possibly more sustained and extensive than covered under B above.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">D. If Communists attack elsewhere in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Our current estimate here tends to support your judgment that this not

                            and might bring about drastic US intervention. However, we are
                            particularly concerned that GM–16 withdrawal may invite action against
                            Attopeu. If this occurred we would expect to authorize <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> air action in area but would also have
                            to consider movement US air and ground <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210" facs="0242"/>forces to Thailand and possibly across Mekong if attack
                            went further than Attopeu. Same possibility exists if Communists should
                            attack at some other point threatening Mekong.</p>
                        <p>We have considered whether a US air and/or ground deployment to Thailand
                            might be helpful in event of contingency C above and request Bangkok
                            comments whether Thai might agree and approve and Vientiane comments
                            whether such action would bolster Souvanna in this case. In <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_TK1">Thanom</persName> May 30 talks,<note n="6" xml:id="d104fn6">Documentation on these talks is scheduled for publication in the

                            estimate of seriousness fall of Muong Soui (Vientiane's 1707) may mean
                            that we should revise our calculations and that Thai would see matter in
                            different light than at that time. We have noted Bangkok's comment that
                            Thai interested more in ground than air deployments, but likelihood
                            would be that air forces would be employed before ground forces as

                                of National Estimates by the Department of State: would the Pathet
                                Lao attack Muong Soui; would they attack if the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> operation was undertaken; and would
                                the Pathet Lao attack on Muong Soui succeed if the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> undertook the offensive? Kent
                                answered that there was a slightly better than even chance that the
                                Pathet Lao would attack; they would certainly attack if there was an
                                    <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> offensive; and there was
                                about an even chance that the garrison at Muong Soui could hold out
                                if attacked as a result of the proposed operation. If there was no
                                    <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> operation, Muong Soui would
                                fall within days if attacked.</note> and the cables at Tab C,<note n="4" xml:id="d105fn4">At Tab C is a series of cables that are
                                footnoted as they are mentioned in the attached briefing

                        <p> Souvanna's initial proposal was for quite extensive U.S. involvement in
                            his attempt to beat the Pathet Lao now holding two roads west of the
                            Plain of Jars, between the two capitals of Vientiane and Luang Prabang.
                            As we have examined it, we think we can in fact meet his needs by a
                            relatively modest increase of U.S. transport support (6 planes and
                            civilian pilots), essentially to move and supply an 1800-man force from
                            Southern Laos to the Muong Soui area. As of yesterday <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> were in favor of this
                            operation. My brother, for good diplomatic reasons, is wary.</p>
                        <p>The reasons for approval are many:</p>
                        <p>(1) Souvanna will be deeply disillusioned if we do not support him in a
                            course that has unanimous backing of non-Communist Lao military, and his
                            own strong personal leadership.</p>
                        <p>(2) The level of new U.S. military commitment is modest (there is no
                            thought of U.S. combat support).</p>
                        <p>(3) Support of the operation should allow us both to strengthen the
                            neutralists near Muong Soui, and to mitigate the bad effects of a
                            possible defeat there.</p>
                        <p>(4) As Laotian battle plans go, this one is unusually promising.</p>
                        <p>The big reasons for wariness are two:</p>
                        <p>(1) Souvanna's attack is very likely to provide the excuse for a
                            successful Pathet Lao attack on Muong Soui.</p>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0244"/>
                        <p>(2) Our diplomatic track will be weakened, as Indians and Russians may
                            abandon Polish proposals and begin to press hard for a Geneva
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>My own conclusion is that while this is a chancy enterprise, our best
                            course today, as for two years past, is prudent support of Prince
                            Souvanna. I would follow the policy outlined in outgoing cable No.

                        <p>SUBJECT</p>
                        <p>Support for Possible Military Operations Within Laos</p>
                        <p>On June 23 the Government of Laos asked for extensive US support for a
                            military operation in the area north of Vientiane and west of the Plain
                            of Jars. In subsequent exchanges with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, it is clear that our response to
                            this request involves serious issues affecting our relationship to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, possible
                            Communist reactions to the proposed operation, and indeed the whole
                            trend of our military actions in Laos.</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Situation and Nature of Proposed Operation</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. Proposed Operation.</p>
                        <p>The operation would be a three-pronged attack designed to secure control
                            of Route 13, which runs between Vientiane and Luang Prabang, and of that
                            part of Route 7 which runs from Route 13 east to the present position of
                            the Neutralist forces at Muong Soui. The initial troop movement would be
                            made about July 1 with the operation itself to commence about July 7–8.
                            Ten government battalions would be involved, including one substantial
                            force to be airlifted from its present position in southern Laos. The
                            opposition in the area is currently estimated at three Pathet Lao <pb n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0245"/>battalions. The operation as
                            proposed by the Lao called for US participation in the following
                            respects:</p>
                        <p>a. Some prior US reconnaissance activity in the area.</p>
                        <p>b. Extensive Air America airlift support using US civilian pilots and
                            aircraft currently within Laos, supplemented by three additional <gloss target="#t_C1231">C–123</gloss>'s and three Caribou which could be
                            supplied with Air America markings.</p>
                        <p>c. US civilian pilots in Lao <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s in
                            combat operations. In examining the proposal, we have already concluded
                            that the use of US civilian pilots in <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s (c. above) is not necessary provided that—[<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. However,
                            we must recognize that use of US pilots in airlift support of combat
                            operations (b. above), even though they would be civilians flying
                            unarmed aircraft, represents a degree of open US involvement going
                            beyond anything we have hitherto done and laying the US open to charges
                            of direct violation of Article 4 of the Geneva Accords<note n="6" xml:id="d105fn6">Article 4 of the Protocol to the Declaration on the
                                Neutrality of Laos, July 23, 1962, prohibited the introduction of
                                foreign regular and irregular troops, foreign para-military troops,
                                and foreign military personnel into Laos. For text, see American
                                Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1962, pp. 1078–1083.</note> in
                            the sense that the pilots would in effect be performing military
                            operations. This new US involvement differs only in degree from what we
                            have done to date but does have this additional element. The Lao would
                            of course also use their own fairly extensive airlift capability.</p>
                        <p>A military analysis of the operation has been prepared by the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and is separately submitted at Tab A.
                            The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> favor the operation. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, with the advice of his
                            highly competent attaché staff, believes that the operation has a
                            reasonable chance to succeed.</p>
                        <p>B. Threat to Neutralist Forces in Muong Soui.</p>
                        <p>This is the major element in the current military situation, and the
                            operation is designed to relieve pressure on Muong Soui and to provide a
                            consolidated government-held area into which the forces in Muong Soui
                            could retreat if defeated. The current judgment in Vientiane is that the
                            Communist forces are massing for a possible early attack on Muong Soui,
                            and the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> has been dramatizing the
                            threat. A Washington intelligence judgment by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is at Tab B; it concludes that an attack on Muong Soui
                            is a little better than 50/50 today, and will become probable, as a
                            normal response, if Souvanna's operation is carried out.</p>
                        <p>The Neutralist forces in Muong Soui number approximately 3300 and,
                            although apparently in a reasonably good state of organization and
                            morale, have several deficiencies, notably in respect to artillery
                            crews. The current judgment is that, if the Communists attack in full
                            force using tanks and artillery, Muong Soui could not be held for more
                            than 3–4 days, even if the present Lao <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s were augmented by additional American-piloted <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s as well as extensive US
                            reconnaissance/strike operations.</p>
                        <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0246"/>
                        <p>Defeat of the Neutralist forces at Muong Soui could have extremely
                            serious consequences in military and above all in political terms. The
                            Neutralist forces would probably be dispersed, though a great many would
                            find their way down toward Vientiane and link up with other government
                            forces. The Meo would also be exposed. Above all, the cumulative effect
                            of this defeat, coming on top of the May defeats, could well discourage
                            Souvanna completely and possibly result in drastic and unwise action by
                            Neutralist and Rightist generals either in the form of military action
                            for its own sake or in the form of some political upheaval in Vientiane
                            that could damage or even destroy Souvanna's position. Although we have
                            not hitherto regarded a Communist attack on Muong Soui as in the same
                            category as Communist offensives against the Mekong areas or Luang
                            Prabang, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has now
                            stressed that it has assumed a much greater psychological importance
                            than we had hitherto realized.</p>
                        <p>In relation to the threat to Muong Soui, the proposed operation can be
                            argued both ways. On the one hand, it might trigger a Communist attack
                            that would not otherwise have taken place. On the other hand,
                            particularly if there were some identifiable Communist action against
                            Muong Soui, the US would be in a very serious position if it had refused
                            to support an operation designed to relieve Muong Soui. Even if the
                            operation did not achieve its objectives and if Muong Soui fell, it
                            would be far better for the US-Lao relationship to have made the effort
                            and to have failed than to have held the Lao back from what they
                            regarded as a promising attempt to help.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has joined with
                            both Neutralist and <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> generals in
                            planning the proposed operation and has indeed prodded them into the
                            present plan. Both he and they believe that the May defeats were about
                            all they could take and must be countered by some offensive action on
                            the Government's side. In addition, Souvanna and his generals,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> reports, have
                            noted the various statements and evidences of our own determinations to
                            hold in Southeast Asia (attaching special weight to the <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> appointment<note n="7" xml:id="d105fn7">As Ambassador to Vietnam as of July 1, 1964.</note>
                            as an indicator of possible stronger action) and have come to believe
                            that the US is prepared to go far in breaching the Geneva Accords in
                            support of government military operations. It is <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s judgment that failure on our
                            part to support the proposed operation would make it very difficult to
                            maintain the confidence of Souvanna and the generals in our ultimate
                            willingness to take strong action to defend Laos and with it Southeast
                            Asia. (Souvanna is also urging maintenance of a major reconnaissance
                            program within Laos <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0247"/>and the use
                            of reconnaissance flights for strike operations to cut Route 7 east of
                            the Plain of Jars.)</p>
                        <p>D. International Factors</p>
                        <p>The future diplomatic track concerning Laos is still uncertain. The Poles
                            have discussed a modified proposal with the British, involving initial
                            meetings of the three Lao factions, with the participation (apparently
                            on something of a sideline basis) of the co-chairmen (the British and
                            the Soviets) and the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> members
                            (Canada, India, Poland), with the co-chairmen then to determine whether
                            conditions warrant a full-scale Geneva Conference. This is an entirely
                            acceptable variant from the original Polish proposal, and we have told
                            the British we would endorse their accepting it. However, they and the
                            Poles have not yet agreed on a form of invitation, and it is possible
                            that the Poles and the Soviets are weighing their actions very
                            carefully. There is also a serious question whether the Pathet Lao would
                            accept even this modification, and the Poles are apparently dealing
                            directly with them to work this out. In sum, there is a good chance that
                            the proposal will surface in the next few days, and it remains by far
                            the best bet we have to keep negotiations on Laos moving without
                            weakening on our insistence on withdrawal. (During the week we have
                            examined alternatives if the Polish proposal does not get off the
                            ground, and none of these alternatives, including resort to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, seems to have real promise of buying
                            time and making some progress on issues other than withdrawal.)</p>
                        <p>If renewed hostilities in Laos appeared to be initiated by the
                            Government, with US support, and not in response to Communist action,
                            this could have a serious disruptive effect on our negotiating track.
                            Even though we might reduce direct US involvement, almost all the
                            countries concerned with the diplomatic negotiations would probably
                            assume that the operation had US blessing and was part of a broad US
                            plan to maintain and increase pressure in Laos. The French would
                            naturally resume their pressure for an immediate Geneva Conference, but,
                            most important, the Indians and Soviets might well believe that the US
                            was moving drastically further and that the only way out was to get an
                            immediate Geneva Conference. Even the British and Canadians might well
                            weaken under these circumstances, and the total result would be serious
                            danger to the possibility of the Polish proposals doing what we hope
                            they can do.</p>
                        <p>Our second international problem would be the reaction of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Unless the Communists had started to
                            move against Muong Soui, the Indians and Poles would probably regard the
                            operation as a breach of the cease-fire and would be particularly
                            sensitive to the degree of direct US involvement in violation of the
                            Geneva Accords. Although Souvanna and we could argue that the action was
                            entirely justified in response to far more serious Communist aggressions
                            of May—which it certainly is— <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0248"/>it would be difficult to head off <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            investigation, and the Indians in particular might be very difficult
                            indeed. In relation to the negotiating track, offensive action by the
                            government would tend to obscure the blame that now rests on the
                            Communists for their May actions and would tend to support a “plague on
                            both your houses” position by key nations that would greatly weaken our
                            pressure to bring about Communist withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, these adverse international reactions would be sharply changed
                            to the degree that the operation could be represented as being a relief
                            of Muong Soui. Vientiane's present estimate that attack on Muong Soui
                            may be imminent, coupled with the timetable proposed for the operation,
                            may make it possible to justify the operation completely on this basis.
                            But we cannot now be sure of this.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, adverse international reaction would be reduced to the extent
                            the US was not directly involved. In a broad sense, the operation does
                            not represent a major change from what we have been doing in our
                            reconnaissance operations. However, we have had a strong justification
                            for the latter, and have hitherto refrained from direct military
                            involvement in combat operations within Laos.</p>
                        <p>E. Possible Communist Reactions</p>
                        <p>The Communists almost certainly already know of the proposed operation,
                            since it has been prepared by a wide circle of military planners in
                            Vientiane. They thus have ample time both to prepare their defenses and
                            to consider action in other parts of Laos in response.</p>
                        <p>Within the area actually affected by the operations, the Communists would
                            have difficulty in any major reinforcement. The nearest Viet Minh units
                            are believed to be several days' march away, on the eastern edge of the
                            Plain of Jars, and would have to come through rough country to reach the
                            area. We would probably get some information on any such movement.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Communists could easily react by an extensive
                            attack on Muong Soui.<note n="8" xml:id="d105fn8">The following phrase
                                and sentence were crossed out at this point: “and it is far from
                                clear that the proposed operation would put the government forces in
                                a stronger position to resist such an attack in the short term. On
                                the contrary, the extensive effort involved would probably weaken
                                the government's capacity to help the forces at Muong Soui.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Moreover, the Communists have the option of attacking in other parts of
                            Laos. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> thinks this is
                            unlikely, on the ground that they already have this option and have not
                            exercised it, and that they must know that action in other areas would
                            be in effect a move toward the Mekong. Washington intelligence judgment
                            shares this view, although there is some concern that the Communists
                            might move in the Attopeu area of southern Laos, from which the
                            additional forces required for the <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0249"/>operation would be drawn. Even though some compensating
                            reinforcement of Attopeu is planned, the town is now dangerously
                            encircled by Pathet Lao forces. The same is true of many other points
                            along the boundary between the government forces and the Pathet Lao, and
                            it remains true (and <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> agrees)
                            that the Communists have the capability of taking government positions
                            just about any place they choose.</p>
                        <p>In terms of its signal effect on Hanoi and Peking, US involvement in the
                            operation would have some initial value, but the real impact would
                            probably depend on what we did if the Communists reacted by attacking
                            Muong Soui or elsewhere. If we failed to react very strongly to such
                            action, the Communists might well conclude that we were trying to do
                            things in Laos on the cheap.</p>
                        <p>II. Possible Courses of Action</p>
                        <p>In the light of all these factors, the Secretaries of State and Defense
                            yesterday agreed to a tentative position set forth in the outgoing
                            State/Defense message, 1267 to Vientiane, attached hereto. The reply
                            from Vientiane (Vientiane 1726)<note n="9" xml:id="d105fn9">Dated June
                                28. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> concurs
                            generally in the proposed position and is also attached. No reply has
                            been received from Bangkok, but Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> had previously urged that we approve and support
                            the operation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the diplomatic repercussions, we queried London, Paris,
                            Moscow, New Delhi, and Ottawa last night (State 8632 to London
                                attached).<note n="10" xml:id="d105fn10">Sent also to Paris, Ottawa,
                                Moscow, New Delhi, and Ottawa, June 27. (Ibid.)</note> The replies
                            received to date are as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Moscow 3934,<note n="11" xml:id="d105fn11">Dated June 28.
                                (Ibid.)</note> attached, feels that the Soviets would react very
                            adversely, back off the Polish proposal, and shift to all-out support
                            for an immediate Geneva Conference.</p>
                        <p>b. London 6481,11 attached, indicates that the British would be troubled
                            but would try to support us. It urges that the British be fully cut in,
                            and mentions that they would expect our support if they had to take a
                            somewhat parallel action in the Indonesian situation in the near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>c. Ottawa 1748,11 attached, indicates the Canadians would be lukewarm
                            unless the operation clearly appeared a response to direct and imminent
                            threat against Muong Soui. It stresses that the Canadians should be
                            fully consulted in any event before we take action.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet reaction may be a serious factor requiring further
                            consideration. The British and Canadian reactions make it clear that we
                            should consult with them and this we should certainly plan to do if we
                            adhere to the tentative position stated in last night's outgoing
                            message.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> discussed the Muong Soui
                            disclosure; stated that the odds were better than even that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> would attack Muong Soui therefore the FAR
                            operations proposed by <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> had been under serious consideration; however in
                            evaluating the operation we must recognize they would undoubtedly bring
                            on an attack on Muong Soui.</p>
                        <p>2. William <persName>Bundy</persName> then reviewed in considerable
                            detail the <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> plan of attack on Routes 13 and 7.
                            After some questioning, McNamara stated that he, Vance and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> supported the plan.</p>
                        <p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> stated that
                            the Joint Chiefs feel the plan had reasonable chances of success,
                            mentioning that they are better than 50–50 and that the Joint Chiefs
                            should unanimously support the plan.</p>
                        <p>4. The President turned to me and asked my opinion. I said that I
                            personally supported the actions but noted that the movement of 1800
                            troops from Attapu and weakening Attapu defenses would very possibly
                            cause Attapu to fall to the Pathet Lao. McGeorge Bundy said that an
                            attack on Attapu would open up an entirely new set of problems as Attapu
                            was considered one of the Mekong towns.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that a more
                            serious problem would be the chances of success or failure of the
                            effort. If the effort failed, then we would have a more serious problem
                            on our hands in Laos; however he felt there was a good chance of
                            success. All agreed that it was extremely difficult to forecast success
                            of the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/Lao operation.</p>
                        <p>6. After some discussion the President approved the attached cable

                        <p>4. Clearly one weakness proposed operation is inability move artillery
                            forward after opening phases. Are there measures we could take to help
                            on this, such as additional jeeps to carry ammunition?</p>
                        <p>5. We continue to attach great importance to linking this operation to
                            defense of Neutralist forces now at Muong Soui. Souvanna's statements
                            helpful in this regard and we here stressing to press that threat <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0252"/>serious and imminent.
                            Importance this rationale should be stressed to Souvanna, and we believe
                            he should follow up by immediate call for <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> to pull back and—unless you feel this would uncover Thai
                            activity—for ICC mobile teams to go to Muong Soui area (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1265).<note n="8" xml:id="d107fn8">Dated June 26. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>6. In light Moscow's 3934,<note n="9" xml:id="d107fn9">See <ref target="#d105fn11">footnote 11, Document 105</ref>.</note>
                            appears particularly vital get across defensive rationale to Soviets.
                            Believe this can best be done by Vientiane stressing to Soviet Charge
                            reality of threat to Muong Soui and, at appropriate time, adding that
                            movement <gloss target="#t_GM1">GM</gloss>-16 directly related defense
                            Muong Soui. Although we assume Soviets in Vientiane aware of operation,
                            Moscow reaction may be somewhat tempered by such explanation and by
                            continued effort, both in Vientiane and Moscow, stress defensive nature
                            and also limited scale of operation if and when it starts.</p>
                        <p>7. As suggested Delhi's 3921,<note n="10" xml:id="d107fn10">Dated June
                                29. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note>
                            Vientiane should also fill-in Indian Ambassador on operation, stressing
                            its relation to defense Muong Soui. Delhi may in its discretion brief
                            Desai.</p>
                        <p>8. We also concerned statements by generals or others may play up
                            offensive aspect and hurt basic defensive rationale. We must also get
                            them to downplay US role and preferably not discuss at all. (<persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> particularly has given Time<note n="11" xml:id="d107fn11">Apparently reflected in articles in Time,

                            above lines and plan also to give somewhat less complete fill-in to
                            French. In no case will role of Thais be disclosed.</p>
                        <p>10. Assume you will advise final timetable including timing GM–16 airlift
                            and coordinated attack.</p>
                        <p>11. For Bangkok. You should draw fully on Deptel 1267 to Vientiane in
                            explaining our position to Thai. We particularly concerned they not
                            misjudge feasibility holding Muong Soui if <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> make determined attack, or limits our counteraction both

                        </list>
                        <p>We have attempted to weigh US options in Laos against the background of
                            the changes that have occurred there over the past year. The courses of
                            action open to us fall into four general categories: 1) continuing in
                            our present stance; 2) attempting to reconstitute the neutral solution;
                            3) opting for formal or “hard” partition essentially along present lines
                            of control; and 4) seeking this partition with expanded non-Communist
                            territorial holdings.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Situation</p>
                        <p>Although, in many respects, the situation we now face in Laos is similar
                            to that of twelve months ago, certain differences alter our position and
                            outlook:</p>
                        <p>1) The neutralists' status has changed markedly. The April coup has
                            undermined Souvanna's position as a neutral, although the unravelling of
                            the coup under international pressure may have strengthened him somewhat
                            in his role as leader of all non-Communist forces. Militarily, the
                            territorial base of Kong Le's neutralist forces is all but lost.</p>
                        <p>2) The image of the Vientiane government as a three forces coalition has
                            eroded further. The Pathet Lao, continuing to reject Souvanna's right to
                            take action as head of the national government in the absence of
                            unanimous agreement by all three parties, has charged that Souvanna is a
                            captive of the right and the United States. It has declared that it
                            cannot regard him as premier as long as he continues on his present
                            course, and has announced that it will withdraw its entire
                            representation from Vientiane. Souvanna has designated non-Communists to
                            act for the long-absent Pathet Lao cabinet members without formally
                            replacing them. The possibility that the Communists are prepared at a
                            time of their own choosing to establish a rival government is suggested
                            by reports that they have organized a “true” neutralist-Pathet Lao
                            shadow government.</p>
                        <p>3) The right wing has become both more militant and more fractured.
                            Differences between Phoumi and the Sannanikones have come closer to the
                            surface and <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s power
                            position is something of an enigma.</p>
                        <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0254"/>
                        <p>4) There have been further defections from Kong Le's forces to the “true”
                            neutralists. Khamouane Boupha also appears to have allied himself with
                            the “true” neutralists. Should the Pathet Lao attempt to portray their
                            neutralists as the sole remaining neutralist faction, the adherence of
                            Khamouane Boupha with his territorial base in Phong Saly and his control
                            of 1500 troops could lend greater credibility to their claims.</p>
                        <p>5) The Pathet Lao, with North Vietnamese support, have extended their
                            control over almost all of the territory they occupied jointly with the
                            neutralists before 1962. They have also done considerable damage to the
                            Meo. We continue to believe, however, that they do not propose to move
                            to the Mekong at this juncture.</p>
                        <p>6) The United States, to the limited degree implied by our air
                            activities, has become an open military participant in the
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>7) North Vietnam has responded to American escalation signals by
                            expressing its determination to defend itself and by practical defensive
                            measures. However, even if Asian Communist demands for reconvening the
                            Geneva Conference primarily reflect fear of escalation, this fear has
                            not yet caused them to modify their negotiating terms nor is it yet
                            clear that they have abandoned their military advance in Laos.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">The Prospects</p>
                        <p>Together these developments certainly make it even more difficult to
                            sustain the argument that Laos can be effectively neutralized by
                            international action. To some degree also, the real world of Laos has
                            been altered in that the de facto partition has been geographically
                            sharpened by the Communist advance in the Plaine des Jarres and the
                            consequent removal from most of that area of neutralist forces formerly
                            intermingled with the Pathet Lao. Whether the closer relationship that
                            has developed between the right and the neutralists constitutes a
                            corresponding advantage for us is open to some question; the
                            relationship is a tenuous one at best.</p>
                        <p>These alterations, however, do not eliminate the prospect, which is
                            indeed fortified by the advent of the rainy season, that we are in for
                            another period of stalemated negotiations and relative military

                        <p>Under these circumstances, we have the option of accepting Laotian
                            marching and countermarching as tolerable since our vital interests lie
                            in Vietnam and friendly forces hold the Mekong. This stance, in essence
                            a continuation of the posture we have adopted to date, permits us to
                            claim the support of the Geneva Accords for Souvanna as Prime Minister
                            and thereby justify our assistance to him. Our continued diplomatic
                            activity and limited retaliatory measures will probably keep credible
                            our Mekong deterrent. This will spur Moscow to use what little leverage
                            it has to keep Laos below the boiling point.</p>
                        <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0255"/>
                        <p>Meanwhile, we can continue to press for effective utilization of the
                            Geneva machinery and support Souvanna's efforts to secure acceptable
                            terms from the Pathet Lao through our diplomatic and military moves. By
                            pushing for full implementation of the Geneva Accords, we will maintain
                            credit with those neutrals and allies who are anxious to avoid a further
                            spread of hostilities. Our own military involvement and commitment would
                            thus remain at a low level.</p>
                        <p>As time goes on, however, particularly if Pathet Lao territorial
                            nibblings are not met with at least some successful <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/neutralist counter nibbles, morale in
                            Vientiane may reach a critical point. Souvanna's position at this stage
                            may present us with one of two problems. If he continues his present
                            militancy, he may demand US moves that will destroy the uneasy status
                            quo or destroy it himself by leaving the scene. If, on the other hand,
                            he tolerates continuing the status quo with only limited retaliatory
                            measures against the Communists, he will face moves from the right to
                            overthrow him which, if successful, would intensify the pressures on the
                            United States to alter its stance.</p>
                        <p>We will face also the problem of adjusting our interventions on behalf of
                            friendly forces to meet two somewhat conflicting objectives: maintaining
                            the plausibility of our ultimate deterrent and avoiding premature
                            escalation. This problem is likely to grow progressively more difficult
                            and acute. On the one hand, restraint may make our actions ineffectual,
                            with all the obvious impact on Lao morale and on domestic and
                            international opinion. On the other hand, we will be uncertain whether
                            moves of greater force will induce Communist restraint or a
                            sharply-increased response. In any case we will remain under continuing
                            pressures to accept a new Geneva Conference. Moreover, these pressures
                            will increase in direct ratio to the threat of escalation of US and
                            Chinese Communist involvement.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties and frustrations of this stance have been amply
                            demonstrated over the past two years. It remains an open question,
                            however, whether other courses would be both feasible and more
                            profitable. Omitting measures focused essentially outside Laos, which in
                            any case would have to be directly related to measures within Laos
                            itself, alternative policies fall into two general categories: a
                            concerted effort to reconstitute the neutral solution; or a more open
                            acceptance and exploitation of the partition.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A Reconstituted Neutral Solution</p>
                        <p>In our present stance, reconstitution of the neutral solution remains our
                            ostensible objective. However, existing circumstances make achievement
                            of this objective highly unlikely. As the contenders are now disposed,
                            restoration of the tripartite government in any real sense would require
                            concessions unacceptable to one side or the other. For Souvanna at this
                            juncture to disassociate himself from the right in terms acceptable <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0256"/>to the Pathet Lao would require
                            him in effect to surrender a position that he has reached with our
                            encouragement over a considerable period of time. Any alternative leader
                            prepared to abandon this position would be difficult to find outside the
                            ranks of pro-Pathet Lao neutralists who would be unacceptable to the
                            right. Even if Souvanna were prepared to abandon his position, moreover,
                            it is difficult to see how he could secure right-wing acquiescence;
                            another coup in Vientiane would thus become highly likely. If we acceded
                            to Souvanna's abandonment of his terms and increased the pressures on
                            the right to acquiesce, this reversal of our public position would call
                            into question our basic resolve, particularly in the minds of the Thai
                            and South Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>For the Pathet Lao and their Chinese and Vietnamese supporters, on the
                            other hand, Souvanna's present terms can hold no interest unless
                            rejecting them presents unacceptable dangers. It is possible, although
                            unlikely, that the cumulative effects of our present air activities
                            could induce the Communists to modify their current stance in order to
                            secure a recess that would leave open the possibility of forward
                            movement at a later date. <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>'s apparent acceptance of the Polish
                            proposal for tripartite negotiations may be a move in this direction. It
                            is more likely, however, that to raise the level of threat and to bring
                            about effective Soviet leverage would require US military intervention
                            on a considerably more substantial scale. At best, this intervention on
                            behalf of the neutral solution could lend credence to the viability and
                            defensibility of that solution, restore the territorial balance (perhaps
                            more fully observed and effectively policed) and restore the tripartite
                            stalemate in Vientiane. At worst, it could lead to prolonged hostilities
                            and higher levels of outside Communist support for the Pathet Lao, with
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> constrained to provide at
                            least diplomatic and propaganda backing for the Communist side. Between
                            these extremes, and perhaps most likely, we could anticipate intensified
                            pressures for an immediate, unconditional reconvocation of the Geneva
                            signatories.</p>
                        <p>Weighing the risks of this course against the very limited likely
                            advantages suggests that if American military power is to be applied on
                            any significant scale in Laos it should be in pursuit of broader
                            objectives than those attainable through an effort to reconstitute a
                            neutral solution, which has not proved successful in the past and which
                            holds little prospect for greater success in the future.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Exploitation of Partition—Present Territorial
                            Arrangements</p>
                        <p>As a result of military action over the past year there is now less
                            intermingling of friendly and hostile forces and, therefore, a somewhat
                            more coherent territorial base for the transformation of the “soft”
                            partition that has existed in Laos since the signing of the Geneva
                            Accords into a more formal division under rival regimes. There is also
                            some possibility that both Souvanna, now completely disenchanted with
                            the Communists, <pb n="225" xml:id="pg_225" facs="0257"/>and the Pathet
                            Lao, close to a break with Souvanna and in a stronger territorial
                            position, might find such a division more attractive than would have
                            been the case a year ago. However, a “hard” partition on the basis of
                            present territorial holdings would be of questionable advantage to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The principal area in which friendly and Communist forces were
                            intermingled—the Plaine des Jarres—has now come largely under Communist
                            control and is unlikely to be negotiable. Intermingling remains a
                            problem south of Luang Prabang and south and west of the Mekong between
                            Ban Houei Sai and Luang Prabang. Territorial adjustments in this area
                            have been largely in favor of friendly forces and, under a partition
                            proposal, shifts might be negotiable. Khammouane Boupha's sector of
                            Phong Saly, however, would probably move from its present still somewhat
                            anomalous status to complete identification with the Pathet Lao side.
                            Meo positions are almost entirely within Pathet Lao territory, and the
                            Meo would be difficult if not impossible to move to another area as a
                            fighting force.</p>
                        <p>Without the Plaine des Jarres, <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            territorial holdings would be more compactly disposed, more defensible
                            by Lao forces, and more effectively fortified by conventional means
                            against further nibbling. Were we, however, to initiate or accept a firm
                            partition after having lost the Plaine, we would be seen as moving or
                            reacting from weakness and the plausibility of our Mekong deterrent,
                            although not necessarily weakened, would certainly not be enhanced.</p>
                        <p>Under such partition, we might wish to continue to uphold the concept of
                            international neutrality for our zone in Laos, without, however,
                            compromising its right to request and receive defensive support from
                            friendly powers. This stance would offer the prospect of maximizing
                            international acceptability and support of a reconstituted Royal Lao
                            Government and might even provide some basis for the continued use of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, at least as a device to keep
                            its members involved in the Laos problem and to publicize Communist
                            violations. In a partitioned Laos, however, efforts by us to maintain
                            Souvanna's position against erosion from the right could no longer rely
                            so completely upon the importance of his international acceptability,
                            with the danger that our role in Lao internal arrangements would be more
                            vulnerable to charges of external dictation. At the same time, the
                            retention of Souvanna himself in this situation would be less vital to
                            our interests, particularly after a successful transition had been made
                            to the new arrangements, although the problem of coming forward with a
                            competent successor able to unify the various factions will remain. In
                            any event our involvement with the Lao government would be likely to
                            increase, with past performance holding little promise that even the
                            complete elimination of the Pathet Lao factor in the <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0258"/>non-Communist zone would result in a
                            government notably more united, dedicated, or capable.</p>
                        <p>Although the complete collapse of the Geneva arrangements might remove
                            formal restraints on our assistance to the Vientiane government, the
                            practical effects of this removal could be rather limited except insofar
                            as we wished to inject our own or Thai and perhaps other ground forces.
                            Already Souvanna has been willing to legitimize a fairly wide range of
                            overt military assistance. Such Meo and similar activities as we wished
                            to continue in the Pathet Lao zone would require covert support in any
                            case, and there are distinct limitations on the amount of assistance
                            that FAR and neutralist forces themselves can absorb.</p>
                        <p>Partition of Laos on this basis would provide no more real protection
                            against subversion than did the partition of Vietnam in 1954, the
                            question here being whether the Pathet Lao supported by the North
                            Vietnamese would be as effective in this role as the Viet Cong.
                            Certainly the long border, approximately 1,000 miles, could not be
                            closed effectively against infiltration from the Communist side.</p>
                        <p>Finally, partition of Laos along existing territorial lines would leave
                            the Communists in control of the corridor into South Vietnam. As the
                            same time, in considering operations to restrict Communist use of the
                            corridor based in South Vietnam or elsewhere, we would no longer need to
                            be restrained by the effects of such operations upon tripartite
                            arrangements in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Exploitation of Partition—New Territorial Arrangements</p>
                        <p>To establish a partition based on territorial arrangements other than
                            those that now exist would almost certainly require the intervention of
                            United States forces on some significant scale, especially if the
                            territorial arrangement were to be genuinely advantageous. To be
                            advantageous in a partition, such an arrangement should be the Mekong
                            Valley plus the panhandle rather than the Mekong Valley plus the Plaine
                            des Jarres.</p>
                        <p>In our contingency planning of the past, a move into the panhandle has
                            usually been envisaged as a response to a clear Communist military
                            threat to the Mekong. If, however, the panhandle is seen as seizable and
                            worth seizing in the interests of our position in Vietnam, it is
                            questionable whether we benefit by waiting for the Communists to provide
                            us with a trigger only to maximize the international legitimacy of our
                            position. Our posture, for some time, has communicated our determination
                            to move more decisively if necessary to protect the Royal Lao Government
                            and South Vietnam. We have the evidence on which to present a strong
                            case against Communist violations of the Geneva Accords. Moreover, for
                            many of the countries making up the numerical majority in the world
                            community, the <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0259"/>question is not
                            so much who is right in Indochina as who is likely to win. For our
                            allies, as well as for friendly neutrals, the question is not so much
                            whether the United States should apply its power more forcefully as it
                            is whether there are means of applying this power that we are prepared
                            to employ and that can be effective in stemming the Communist advance
                            without precipitating major hostilities. Especially, for those countries
                            that might be expected to participate usefully in our action to greater
                            or less degree—Thailand, the GVN, the Philippines, the United Kingdom,
                            and Australia—the most significant issues are thus those of scope and
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>We could certainly expect a vigorous Communist response to an effort to
                            seize the panhandle, including: a significantly greater use of North
                            Vietnamese forces, an enhanced supply effort, and, simultaneously,
                            redoubled appeals for an immediate Geneva Conference backed with threats
                            of further escalation. If, however, our advance were to go no further
                            north than would be required to secure the Pathet Lao road net fanning
                            out of the Mu Ghia Pass, we would not be posing a direct threat to vital
                            North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist territory and would thereby
                            minimize the prospect of a genuinely escalatory military reaction.</p>
                        <p>If we were to embark upon such an action we would of course have to
                            accept the indefinite commitment of United States ground forces, in an
                            area that lends itself by terrain and forest cover to prolonged and
                            effective guerrilla resistance. By the same token, although reducing
                            infiltration into South Vietnam, we probably would be unable to seal it
                            off completely and infiltration efforts through other routes (e.g., the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, the sea, and Cambodia) would
                            continue. Finally, the effect of interdiction of infiltration routes on
                            the Viet Cong effort would be primarily psychological and, in terms of
                            military capabilities, long-run rather than immediate, and would not
                            provide a substitute for more vigorous and successful politico-military
                            action in South Vietnam itself.</p>
                        <p>Our ability to seize, hold, and at least partially seal the panhandle,
                            even though not significantly reducing Viet Cong capability in the
                            short-run, could bolster morale in South Vietnam as evidence of
                            effective action against the enemy in what has become his territory.
                            Similarly Thai confidence in our intentions and capabilities would be
                            reinforced and there might be some positive impact also on defeatist
                            “wave of the future” attitudes elsewhere in Asia. At the same time,
                            there would exist the danger of becoming involved in a prolonged and
                            inconclusive campaign—not to speak of a failure—which would tend to
                            reinforce the belief that a Western power, if it denies itself its
                            ultimate weapons, is ineffective against a determined
                            military/subversive campaign in areas bordering on Communist Asia.</p>

                                telegram, drafted by Neubert on July 10, has a note in <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>'s hand indicating it was
                                not sent. The telegram's main theme was that South Vietnam, not
                                Laos, was the key to preventing “further communist encroachment in
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>,” and that a neutral and
                                independent Laos could only be achieved after the defeat of the
                                insurgency in South Vietnam.</note> All it will do is confuse some
                            recipients and discourage others.</p>
                        <p>The telegram is negative, and shows little understanding of what we have
                            been fighting for in the last several years.</p>
                        <p>Our position is substantially better than it was two years ago: We have
                            lost practically no territory, in spite of the May 16 advance, from what
                            the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> controlled in 1962. We are not
                            supporting the neutralists and the conservatives, whereas before we were
                            in the intolerable position of supporting only an unpopular right
                            wing.</p>
                        <p>Our objective must not only be to support Souvanna,<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">The draft telegram stated, “Our ability to keep our
                                options open in Laos is going to depend first of all upon political
                                situation among non-communists in Vientiane. Critical factor here is
                                Souvanna himself.”</note> but to try to strengthen the neutralist
                            position in Laos, including Kong Le. We should make more effective the
                            activity in the villages and elsewhere to popularize this government and
                            to discredit the communists.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we have so far held the Mekong Valley from Viet-Cong
                            control, and to a considerable extent protected Thailand from the
                            subversive incursions that we were gravely concerned would make Thailand
                            another guerrilla battlefield. Our stimulation of activities in Thailand
                            has improved the situation.</p>
                        <p>I agree that Souvanna must be induced to remain at all costs, but some
                            action must be taken to develop a neutralist political force within the
                            country as a matter of basic policy.</p>

                        <p>I have consistently believed that the corridor should be closed from
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> rather than from Laos, and
                            believe that Saigon should be encouraged to increase this activity.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">The draft telegram stated that, with
                                Souvanna's recent collaboration, the United States was in a position
                                in Laos “to place additional military pressure on North Vietnamese
                                use of southern Laos corridor.”</note>

                        <p>I think it is an idle thought that the Pathet Lao will conform to a
                            neutralist solution under its present leadership.<note n="5" xml:id="d109fn5">The draft telegram stated that while avoiding a
                                “Geneva-type Conference,” the United States “must exploit all

                                diplomatic contacts, public statements) to make clear our continued
                                support of 1962 Geneva settlement, to emphasize communist
                                intransigence, and to strengthen Souvanna's position.”</note>

                            12 days from the original schedule, and is due principally to rain

                                13. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> to Len
                                [<persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>] highlighting two
                            points of worry:</p>
                        <p>1. A story out of Vientiane that virtually described the operation in
                            full and above all did not relate it at all to the defense of Muong
                            Soui—which we had all agreed was an important element. The article
                            doubtless told the Communists nothing they did not already know, but it
                            also underscored the difficulty of maintaining the “defensive” rationale
                            in face of the fact that the Communists have been conspicuously lying
                            low at Muong Soui and it has not been possible to point to any specific
                            action there, although they are certainly grouped and perhaps even
                            massed in position to attack.</p>
                        <p>2. The King told Len he estimated <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/VM
                            strength in the area of the operation considerably higher than the 3
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> battalions we had estimated.</p>
                        <p>Based on these two points, we flagged to Len the possible necessity for
                            caution in carrying out the operation. We have not had their reply to
                            the second point.</p>
                        <p>In addition, to these two points, there are the following:</p>
                        <p>3. As a result of the delay, the Communists have had even more time to
                            figure out their next move and deploy for it. In a sense, this does not
                            change our assumptions at the time we approved the operation, but it
                            does underscore this concern. Our best guess is that they would respond
                            by attacking Muong Soui and, although the Thai have moved significant
                            artillery and 200 men to assist there, I would suppose that it remained
                            true that Muong Soui could not be held against a determined attack. We
                            also remain concerned about a possible threat to Attopeu in view of the
                            withdrawal of the Group Mobile, even though it has been replaced by
                            other units that are less good.</p>
                        <p>4. We have informed the Canadians and British quite fully about the
                            operation, and the French have picked it up in Vientiane from the Lao.
                            The Indians also apparently know about it, and their Ambassador is <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0263"/>sympathetic. Thus we have done
                            some insulating against diplomatic reactions, but the French we have
                            regarded as not open to much persuasion. In these exchanges, the only
                            demurring voice has been that of the Canadians, who expressed the fear
                            that the operation would hit the Communists on a particularly sensitive
                            nerve because of the association of the Route 13/7 road junction with
                            their 1961 success, and that the Communists would immediately attack
                            Muong Soui with plausible justification. Despite this worry—which we do
                            not share on the first point—[1–1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified]. The French, however, will certainly blame it at once on
                            Souvanna and on us and re-double all their pressures.</p>
                        <p>5. There have been recurring reports of personal differences among the
                            various Lao generals. We did not assume that there would be perfect
                            coordination, but the picture between the lines sounds rather worse than
                            our expectations.</p>
                        <p>The net of all this does not point, in my judgment, to any change in our
                            basic decision to support the operation.<note n="4" xml:id="d110fn4">In
                                a July 14 memorandum to <persName>Bundy</persName> Green agreed with
                                the views expressed by Bundy, but thought that the Pathet Lao were
                                unlikely to attack Muong Soui because their traditional pattern of
                                aggression was to bite and digest. The recent mammoth bite of the
                                Plain of Jars required considerable digestion. Furthermore bad
                                weather and <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> attacks had “fouled
                                up” Pathet Lao offensive capacity. Green feared that the Pathet Lao
                                would not attack, but rather use the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> operation to charge that the United States and
                                Thailand were breaking the Geneva Accords by supporting Operation
                                Triangle. (Ibid., POL 31–1 LAOS–US)</note> Even a limited success
                            would lift morale and could create much better and more defensible
                            government-held areas. On the other hand, what we may well want to
                            consider is whether we should move fairly strongly to urge caution on
                            Souvanna and perhaps on the individual key military leaders. If they
                            restrict our attempted advances, which would be the likely result from a
                            military standpoint in any event, they will not weaken the defense of
                            Muong Soui significantly. If, however, they get possessed with a
                            “gung-ho” spirit, the forces could end up all over the place to very
                            little purpose and leave Muong Soui more weakly defended. Until we have
                            Unger's judgment, I would not urge a decision on this, but I do think
                            that you could join in what Mac may suggest, i.e., a medium-level hard

                            Operation Triangle. Our thoughts ran along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. “Triangle” is going probably July 19 or 20 or soon thereafter.</p>

                            Triangle—whether, in view of the “new facts” (especially the “offensive”
                            appearance of Triangle) the Operation couldn't be (a) tempered or (b)
                                cancelled.<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">

                            might be that the plan (and its leak) has already served its
                            purpose—viz., defending Muong Soui. (It must be borne in mind, of
                            course, that the Thai may be harder than the Lao to “turn off.”) It
                            would be made clear that, in any event, we should see that the Operation
                            is touted as defensive.</p>
                        <p>5. My judgment is that we are too far from the facts and the scene to
                            tamper with this fragile little operation. However, I see no objection

                        <p>2. Nonetheless, believe it would be helpful for you to have points that
                            emerged here:</p>
                        <p>a. Military situation in operational area itself appears slightly less
                            favorable to anything like full success. Delay has advanced us further
                            into rainy season than Kouprasith and Kong Le originally thought
                            desirable (our June 26 telecon)<note n="4" xml:id="d112fn4">See <ref target="#d104fn3">footnote 3, Document 104</ref>.</note> and our
                            analysis photography Route 13 and Route 7 indicates <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> have number fairly tough defensive
                            positions and may well have had time to add considerable mining and road
                            block obstacles. We had always realized condition of roads would
                            probably prevent forward movement of artillery after opening phase and
                            that T–28's would be relied upon, and July experience would suggest that
                            T–28's would generally be able to operate successfully but may have
                            periods where weather prevents. Our information does not support King's
                            concern of significantly larger number of <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> battalions, but as suggested Embtel 101 there does
                            seem to be possibility some reinforcement through countryside from Sam
                            Neua area or possibly by limited airlift observing radio silence.</p>
                        <p>b. On other hand, defense of Muong Soui has clearly been strengthened and
                            we here would suppose it could now be held unless <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> bring to bear considerably larger
                            forces than now appear to be deployed directly east of Muong Soui.
                            Artillery balance now appears favorable with Thai in place, and our
                            estimate is that T–28 attacks have had major effect on friendly morale
                            and have also impaired PL supply operations. <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0266"/>Also advance of rainy season impairs additional buildup
                            and tends to limit scale of attack.</p>
                        <p>c. Although we of course fully anticipated your need for increased
                            attache personnel, number now assigned to Muong Soui plus plan to have
                            both one <gloss target="#t_AARMA1">AARMA</gloss> and one AIRLO with each
                            advancing column does add up to somewhat greater US exposure than we had
                            fully taken in at time operation approved.</p>
                        <p>d. Fact that <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> have been lying low
                            opposite Muong Soui, plus Reuters and NCNA stories, have made it far
                            more difficult maintain rationale operation is really defensive in
                            support of Muong Soui. We note line proposed your second para. Embtel

                                suggested that neutralist pockets around Muong Kassy and Sala Phou

                                reminding international public opinion of the defensive nature of
                                the operation and the fact that the neutralists had just as much

                            support here by taking position that operation is defensive even if
                            Muong Soui is not attacked. We of course hope further disclosures plus

                            international appearances now likely be somewhat worse than we had hoped
                            when operation approved.</p>
                        <p>e. It follows from point (d) above that <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> might consider they would be in pretty defensible
                            international position if they retaliated sharply either at Muong Soui
                            or perhaps against Attopeu or elsewhere, thus raising chances of such
                            action in areas where we would have great difficulty countering it
                            without major moves. As you know, we have been reluctant to be drawn
                            into major escalation of Lao fighting at this point and have also been
                            concerned that major operations would throw off any possibility of
                            Polish-type negotiating track and perhaps sharply increase pressures for
                            an immediate Geneva conference. British have been fully briefed and have
                            not expressed concern, but we cannot be sure how they would react if
                            ante raised, and Indian and Soviet positions would certainly be
                            doubtful. We take French sabotage for granted.</p>
                        <p>f. Fact that <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> has managed to carry out
                            operation to this point and particularly to strengthen Muong Soui
                            defenses while carrying out continuing effective T–28 attacks may have
                            somewhat diminished need for clear-cut prestige victory to maintain
                            neutralist and rightist morale and avoid excessive rightist pressures on
                            Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>3. We repeat above factors do not in our judgment indicate that operation
                            should not proceed or that we should consider changing our decision to
                            support it. At the same time, however, we believe that increase in
                            international risks and difficulties does warrant consideration our
                            making effort to impress on Lao, and say also to Thai, that we <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0267"/>believe operation should be
                            carried out in a controlled manner.<note n="6" xml:id="d112fn6">In
                                telegram 126 from Vientiane, July 20, the Embassy stated it was “on
                                the same wave length” as the Department on Operation Triangle except
                                for the idea that it should be carried out in “controlled manner.”
                                Lao lethargy, lack of organization and follow-through might well
                                make the operation too “controlled,” that is piecemeal and only a
                                minimal success. In telegram 64 to Vientiane, July 20, the
                                Department responded that what it meant by “controlled manner” was
                                that the operation should not expose the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>/neutralist troops to destructive counterattack by

                            analysis your reports, even limited success would do a great deal to
                            assure maintenance of Lao morale and support for Souvanna's position,
                            while an effort that does not take into account need to maintain
                            adequate defensive posture might weaken the now relatively secure
                            defenses of Muong Soui and lead to a military reverse which the <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> may be in a pretty strong position
                            to argue was simply in retaliation for an unprovoked government
                            offensive.</p>
                        <p>4. If Vientiane generally concurs in above analysis you are authorized
                            draw on points under paras. 2 and 3 above and with Souvanna and
                            appropriate Lao generals, while of course continuing to assure our
                            support on agreed lines. Bangkok should await Vientiane reaction and
                            report whether approach made and if so review status with appropriate
                                <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> officials in same manner. We
                            understand both Vientiane and Bangkok have already made clear limits our

                            of additional C–123's and Caribou, logistic support, Air America pilots
                            for T–28s, napalm, and reconnaissance support), the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendations included preparations
                            for the following “contingency operations in Southeast Asia”:</p>
                        <p>(a) Air strikes by U.S. aircraft against appropriate <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> targets in Laos.</p>

                                a mistake to use napalm in Laos. It was an escalatory step out of
                                proportion to the conventional measures employed by the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN forces and would weaken the case
                                that the operation was defensive. Salans also worried over bombing

                        <p>“Dear Rab:</p>
                        <p>I am writing to give you our reactions to the Soviet note on Laos<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">The Soviet note, July 26, stated that in the
                                face of flagrant violations of the 1962 Geneva Accords, there must
                                be a 14-nation conference on Laos or the Soviet Union would have to
                                reconsider its role as Co-Chairman of the Geneva Conference. The
                                translation of the note is in circular telegram 160, July 26.
                                (Ibid.) The memorandum of a July 26 conversation between Soviet

                        <p>We are not wholly surprised at the Soviet move. They have for some time
                            shown themselves sensitive to the ChiCom and/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> objections to the various Polish proposals, and I am
                            sure are strongly inclined to try to find an excuse to wash their hands
                            of Laos. We would assume the Soviets are far less concerned about
                            actually having a conference than they are with finding some means to
                            withdraw from a difficult and deteriorating situation, and the timing of
                            their move just before their talks with you seems to support this view.
                            Although we have continually impressed on them the importance on
                            US-Soviet relations of their following through on the Kennedy-Khrushchev
                            undertakings going back to June of 1961, this has probably been a
                            weakening factor in their thinking.</p>
                        <p>However, I am sure you would agree, that it is vital not to let them get
                            away either with a call for a 14-nation conference without preconditions
                            or with giving up their role as co-chairman. The unhelpful noises from
                            Paris during the week simply underscore the latter point, and I am sure
                            that you would agree that a Soviet withdrawal at this point would leave
                            us with no negotiating track except for the increasingly mischievous
                            initiatives of DeGaulle.</p>
                        <p>The obvious answer still seems to us to be to get some acceptable variant
                            of the Polish proposals off the ground. On this the Soviet note is
                            clearly weak and indeed contrary to the facts, as you are in a
                            particularly strong position to bring home to them. Far from there being
                            any objection by the Western powers to the Polish proposals (not stated
                            in the note to us but clearly implied, and actually stated orally by the
                            Soviet Charge in handing over the note), the objections have come wholly
                            from the PL, with the ChiComs and Hanoi behind them, and you well recall
                            that Trevelyan was prepared with our consent to be highly forthcoming on
                            the wording of invitations under the original Polish proposal. The only
                            possible Western action to which the Soviets could point would be our
                            delay of a very few days in this late May period, and this was surely
                            entirely reasonable in view of the novelty and implications of the
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>I would suggest that this be your main line with the Soviets, coupled
                            with the strongest possible stress that for them to abandon their
                            Co-Chairman role would be not only a drastic and unwarranted rejection
                            of an obligation freely assumed but could very seriously increase the
                            chances of the situation getting out of hand. I am sure you can ring the
                            changes on this theme forcefully, and I would like your judgment on
                            whether and when it would be useful for us to chime in with a forceful
                            reply along the same lines. Our instinct would be to do so while you are
                            still in Moscow, but to leave the opening guns to you.</p>
                        <p>I know that in any case you will leave the Soviets in no doubt whatever
                            that we would not accept any 14-nation conference without the
                            satisfaction of <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s
                            preconditions, and I am sure you would <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0271"/>be taking the position that you would not join as
                            co-chairman in the issuing of any such invitations.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets may, however, seek to assert that such preconditions are
                            invalid either because of the April events or because of the military
                            operations of <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>,
                            including his imminent offensive against the area of routes 13 and
                            7.</p>
                        <p>You can of course refute any arguments based on the April events, and the
                            Soviets know well what we did at that time, and indeed how closely we
                            worked with them as well as with you. Ambassador Hopson's report on the
                            Soviet Charge's recent remarks at a dinner in support of Souvanna and
                            his neutralist position, which did not include any reference to a
                                conference,<note n="4" xml:id="d114fn4">Not further
                                identified.</note> might also be referred to. You might well add
                            that the Soviet refusal to participate in the Article 4 consultations
                            makes their reference to the April events particularly specious.</p>
                        <p>On the military operation, you will have noted <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>'s protest of
                            July 23<note n="5" xml:id="d114fn5">To the Chairmen of the Geneva

                                LAOS)</note> and the Soviets might well latch onto this. I think
                            Ambassador Hopson has been kept fully posted on all aspects of this
                            action, and we have filled you in here on the degree of support we are
                            giving and why we felt impelled to support the operation. For purposes
                            of discussion with the Soviets, I should think the line to take would be
                            that any operation now pending is a fully justified defensive measure to
                            relieve the continuing <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> pressure on
                            Muong Soui, and that in any case the area involved—as <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> himself has
                            stated—was jointly held in 1962 by the neutralists and <gloss target="#t_NLHX1">NLHX</gloss>, with the neutralists later driven
                            out by the <gloss target="#t_NLHX1">NLHX</gloss>. We would hope you
                            would stress above all that in any case the first blow was clearly
                            struck by the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> May offensive in the
                            Plaine des Jarres, and that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> withdrawal
                            there would resolve the problem on the ground and prepare the way
                            immediately, at least in this respect, for a wider conference.</p>
                        <p>I might add, but not for discussion with the Soviets, that if the present
                            offensive should succeed, the way might be open for a territorial trade
                            of mutual withdrawals or of both sides holding to what they then had.
                            But it is surely premature to get into such possibilities. They might
                            well arise during the course of any Polish-type discussions as part of
                            some arrangement that would seek to restore the military and political
                            situations, while of course also providing for fully effective <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> operations.</p>
                        <p>I realize that it will be an extremely difficult task for you to get the
                            Soviets turned around during your stay in Moscow. They may come up with
                            difficult counter-proposals, and it will certainly be necessary for us
                                <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0272"/>to keep in the closest
                            possible touch with you. I am of course copying this message to Moscow
                            so that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> will be
                            available to you at all times. It may also be useful for us to talk
                            further prior to your departure for Moscow tomorrow and I shall be
                            available if you wish to telephone me.</p>
                        <p>I am also repeating this message to Vientiane and instructing our
                            Ambassador to urge Souvanna to adhere to his position and to make a
                            strong reply to <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>'s protest.</p>

                            would probably be unacceptable to <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>, who regards the Ho Chi Minh Trail as Vietnam's

                            the area at the junction of Routes 7 and 13 (the east-west road across
                            the Plaine des Jarres from North Vietnam and the north-south road
                            linking Vientiane with Luang Prabang) has started. The forces coming up
                            from Vang Vieng in the south have attacked two Pathet Lao villages and
                            appear to have taken them. The forces from the north and east are
                            moving, but have as yet met no opposition. It is too early to say
                            whether Operation Triangle will be in any sense successful, but it seems
                            to have produced a strong political reaction from Souphanouvong, who has
                            complained about it to the co-chairmen.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the Soviets have told us that they are going to insist
                            on a 14-nation Geneva Conference on Laos and have threatened to quit as
                            co-chairmen unless we accept. The British Foreign Secretary is on his
                            way to Moscow, where he will discuss Southeast Asia with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> and possibly Khrushchev. Our
                            position at this point is that we will not go to a conference unless the
                            Pathet Lao withdraw to their positions in the Plaine des Jarres as of
                            May 16. If Operation Triangle is successful, however, there might be the
                            makings of a compromise in the event we wanted to find one.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>With Operation Triangle now underway (in its own fashion), we have three
                            outstanding proposals for action. We have discussed these with Defense,
                            and believe they should not be undertaken or authorized at this moment.
                            However, the situation could develop fast, and I should think it might
                            be wise for us to discuss them with the President at the luncheon.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Vietnam, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> seems to have got <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> cooled off for the moment, and the latest reading
                            on military morale (Saigon 235)<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">Dated July
                                28. (Ibid., Central Files, POL 15–1 VIET S)</note> is somewhat
                            reassuring—at least if one assumes that we can ever read the Vietnamese
                            mind clearly. Thus, we are in a “wait-and-see” period on Vietnam,
                            although I think we must recognize that the nerves of <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> and others have frayed to a
                            greater extent than ever before and are likely to do so again over the
                            next 2–3 months.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Lao Contingency Actions</p>
                        <p>The status of these is:</p>
                        <p>a. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has asked for standing
                            authority to use the Air America pilots in T–28's at any time. He argues
                            that an emergency may arise very rapidly and not permit him to appeal to
                            Washington. His arguments (Vientiane 165)<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">Dated July 26. (Ibid., POL 27 LAOS)</note> are based on annoying
                            but possibly inescapable facts about the use of Lao [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] pilots.
                            Possibly we could place greater pressure on the Lao to use their
                            transport pilots in T–28's, and we should try this out on <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>. Assuming it does not work, I
                            would agree with Defense that we should be negative on any standing
                            authority—but at the same time the situation may compel us to give this
                            authority rapidly if the situation becomes serious.</p>
                        <p>b. Operation Against Route 7. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            has been urging this for some time, with a proposal for Air America
                            pilots using the A1H's out of Vietnam. Although the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> came out for this (in what was reported
                            to be a lukewarm fashion), we have all felt that the better way to do
                            this would be through the Air America pilots in T–28's. Latest
                            photography shows <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0275"/>substantial
                            anti-aircraft along Route 7, so the operation is a risky one at any
                            time. I have agreed with Defense that we should continue to be negative
                            for the time being. But again should have this one as a possible
                            response if the situation becomes serious. A further alternative way to
                            carry this out would be through a “suppressive” recon strike with our
                            own aircraft: again there would be risks.</p>
                        <p>c. Advance guard elements into Thailand. <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> have
                            urged that this be done at the time Operation Triangle kicks off.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> has gone into
                            it in detail and concluded that any added air deployments are not needed
                            and that greater deployments would convey a stronger signal than is
                            warranted by the saving of 6–24 hours in reaction time if it should
                            become necessary to introduce forces into Thailand. I agree with this
                            judgment—but again I think the President should be aware that a
                            deployment to Thailand may become an urgent issue if the military
                            situation becomes serious. I would myself bet a fairly substantial sum
                            that we will be carrying out a deployment to Thailand before the fall,
                            either to stabilize the Lao situation or because of developments in
                            Vietnam—and <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John McNaughton</persName>
                            tends to agree. I suspect strongly the Thai would go along under present
                            circumstances, and might indeed welcome it at the appropriate time.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Laos Negotiations</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName> has indicated (London
                                440)<note n="4" xml:id="d116fn4">Dated July 27. (Ibid.)</note> that
                            the British are going to play their hand in Moscow by proposing
                            invitations to a 14-nation conference with the preconditions written in.
                            I am a little startled at this, as we had urged that a variant of the
                            Polish proposals be the opening gambit. I cannot but suspect <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName> is working to weaken the
                            preconditions to meet Soviet objections, and we may have to work fast on
                            this depending on the reports we get of <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName>'s first conversations. In the last analysis, we
                            can always block a 14-nation conference by refusing to attend, assuming
                            we can hold Souvanna to this position, but I think we are in for a
                            worrisome period. The Polish proposals are still by far the best bet,
                            but I am not sanguine that <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName> and the Soviets will get together on them. This
                            uncertainty about the existence of an acceptable negotiating track
                            underscores the importance of possible measures to stabilize the
                            military situation on the basis of whatever Operation Triangle is able
                            to achieve. Underlyingly, we may be moving willy-nilly toward a
                            partition in Laos, which has advantages and disadvantages.</p>

                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then reported on Laos and
                            South Vietnam. He indicated there was little action in Laos. The
                            neutralist/rightist drive had begun. It was too early to detect results.
                            The men were moving on foot through difficult terrain, but he intimated
                            that we could expect a favorable result. He had no particular view on
                            the political situation within Laos, indicating a wait-and-see attitude.
                            He commented on <persName corresp="#p_BRRA1">Butler</persName>'s trip to
                                Moscow,<note n="2" xml:id="d117fn2">See <ref target="#d116fn4">Document 116 and footnote 4</ref> thereto.</note> stating that
                            the British and the United States were in agreement concerning the terms
                            of a summit conference. He indicated no change in U.S. attitudes or the
                            “pre-conditions” for a 14-nation Geneva Conference. He stated that
                            Khrushchev obviously was tired of the whole affair and wanted to
                            extricate himself from any responsibility in fear that Laos might and
                            Southeast Asia might break out into a more serious situation.</p>
                        <p>With respect to South Vietnam <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            added very little to what is known. He commented on the “go north”
                            attitude of <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> but felt that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s plan for some
                            “joint planning” would calm things down for the time being.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> stated that any change in
                            attitude with respect to U.S. policy in Southeast Asia, including
                            expanding the war in a manner suggested by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, or any other “new look” in Southeast Asia must await
                            the outcome of the Butler talks. He therefore dismissed any
                            consideration of <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> plans.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> reviewed the losses
                            in South Vietnam, briefly reciting figures of the rising casualties, the
                            increased rate of incidents and other difficulties. He made no statement
                            concerning the “trend of the war.” He agreed with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> that no action should be taken at
                            the present time.</p>
                        <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> then said that
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had considered three courses of
                            action. He precisely stated the actions. He paralleled those contained
                            in the Board of National Estimates memorandum.<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">See the July 28 memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> to the President in <ref target="frus1964-68v01">

                                    I</ref>, pp. 585–587. These three actions as described by
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> were: category 1:
                                air raids on the panhandle by the <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>, possibly using napalm, and possibly augmented by
                                Farmgate; category 2: ground force cross-border operations by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> units up to a battalion and perhaps
                                accompanied by U.S. advisers; and category 3: limited airstrikes
                                against military and transportation targets in North Vietnam by
                                unmarked planes flown by non-U.S. air crews.</note> They involved
                            air <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0277"/>strikes in the Laos
                            corridor, which he stated would “hamper but not stop” the infiltration.
                            Secondly the intrusion into the corridor by <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> ground units and he made the same estimate concerning
                            the effect of this. Third, the extension of the war to modest bombing of
                            North Vietnam by unidentified and unmarked South Vietnam planes with
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> pilots. He presented this as an
                            extension of 34–A. He estimated that this would involve no particular
                            escalation of the war and no rise in threat from NVN. He therefore did
                            not advocate a deployment of U.S. units, either ground units, air units
                            or the fleet to strategic locations in Southeast Asia; namely, Clark
                            Field, Thailand, etc. He stated that the Chiefs did not want to take
                            such a move which would have the effect of tying up these units on a
                            stand-by basis with no active mission and hence there would be a rapid
                            deterioration of morale and great criticism at home.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the discussion by <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> the plan to send additional
                            advisors to South Vietnam was mentioned without comment or explanation.
                            It was accepted that since General <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> wanted these additional men they should be
                            furnished to him.</p>

                            napalm explaining why we felt it should not be used in the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> and why the request of Souvanna was
                            denied. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> thought napalm
                            was a “sensitive” weapon and that its use would bring violent reaction
                            from the Soviets and the Chinese Communists and would probably add to
                            the pressure for a Geneva Conference on terms not desired by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked my views and those of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. I stated that we had no disagreement with the reports
                            on the situation in South Vietnam and Laos. The situation in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> was fragile but we could not detect a
                            coalescence of the dissident forces opposed to <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> and while <persName corresp="#p_Khanh1">Khanh</persName> was discouraged, we felt there
                            was a better than even chance that he would survive for the next several
                            months. (Note: This point was mentioned briefly in the meeting,
                            elaborated on at the luncheon meeting.<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">Reference is to a luncheon meeting with the President at the White

                                courses of action were described in abbreviated form by <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> in his memorandum to the
                                President, see <ref target="#d117fn3">footnote 3</ref> above.</note>
                            Obviously courses one and two against Laos could not be considered in
                            view of <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s understandable
                            opposition, which I understood had been accepted by State and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. (Note: <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> specifically referred to this in their written report.)
                            There seemed to be no disagreement <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0278"/>that <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s
                            position was valid. I then said with respect to the third course of
                            action, the North Vietnamese response would be totally dependent upon
                            the level of activity. An occasional bombing would probably be met in
                            response by increased activity of one sort or another in South Vietnam,
                            such as <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> moves, acts of terrorism, etc.
                            If the bombing increased in level of activity and the NVN felt a vital
                            interest were threatened, we might see a deployment of air defense
                            units, such as MIG–17's and 19's from Communist China. These indeed
                            might be flown by ChiComs. We saw no reason to deploy military units to
                            strategic locations, such as the Philippines or Thailand, unless and
                            until a relatively substantial effort was programmed against NVN, which
                            would lead the NVN and the ChiComs to feel that they were being really
                            threatened.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned after about 45 minutes. There were no policy
                            matters to discuss. The purpose of the meeting was merely to report to

                            deteriorating situation in Laos which was handed to the Under Secretary
                            of State on July 26.<note n="2" xml:id="d118fn2">See <ref target="#d114fn2">footnote 2, Document 114</ref>.</note> You

                            believe that latter adequately covers the points of substance involved,
                            I should like personally <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0279"/>to
                            express my concern over the suggestion in the Soviet statement that the
                            USSR would be compelled to examine its role as Co-Chairman under the
                            Geneva Agreements if its proposal for a conference is not accepted.</p>
                        <p>I realize that the task of the Co-Chairmen has been an onerous and
                            largely thankless one. The same may be said of most activities which we
                            carry out to keep the peace. I know the importance which you, Mr.
                            Chairman, attach to this responsibility, and I recall your statement of
                            July 8: “To insure stable peace, to rid mankind of the menace of
                            thermonuclear war, peaceful coexistence of states with different social
                            systems—these are the noble goals for which the Soviet Government is
                            fighting resolutely in the international arena.”<note n="4" xml:id="d118fn4">The source for this quote has not been
                                identified.</note> With regard to Laos, the Soviet Union together
                            with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, has accepted, through the
                            Geneva Agreements of 1962, a special responsibility with respect to
                            those Agreements. It is a responsibility which I believe the whole world
                            expects the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom to discharge, even
                            though there may be frustrations at times.</p>
                        <p>As President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>'s successor,
                            I have a special duty to urge that the Soviet Union persevere in this
                            task which is so important to the possibility of a peaceful solution of
                            the problem. The understanding which you and President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> reached at Vienna in June 1961
                            laid the basis for the 1962 Geneva Agreements on Laos. As you know, we
                            have regarded this understanding as a demonstration that it is possible
                            for the two of us, despite disagreements on some important questions, to
                            cooperate to keep the peace in the mutual interest of both sides.</p>
                        <p>We have not been opposed in principle to a new conference on Laos. But I
                            would remind you that there has not been the slightest hint or
                            indication that Hanoi and Peiping would come to such a conference with
                            the idea of giving full effect to the Agreements reached in 1962. This
                            is why we have supported Prince <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>'s so-called “preconditions;” surely they
                            constitute the most minimum indication that such a conference could meet
                            with any prospect of success.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it seems to me that we should not reach a point where diplomacy
                            admits there is nothing else to do. Discussions continue about the
                            possibility of a meeting of Laotian leaders. We do not believe, further,
                            that the Polish proposals should be abandoned. In other words, it is my
                            view that we should make further attempts to bring about full compliance
                            with the Geneva Agreements. If our joint efforts are to have any chance
                            of success, it seems to me necessary that the Soviet Union continue to
                            accept its responsibility as Co-Chairman.</p>
                        <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0280"/>
                        <p>In this most recent period, our two governments can derive encouragement
                            from the fact that we have achieved two important agreements, the
                            Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Geneva Agreements on Laos.<note n="5" xml:id="d118fn5">For texts, see American Foreign Policy: Current
                                Documents, 1963, pp. 1032–1037 and ibid., 1962, pp. 1075–1083,
                                respectively.</note> Looking toward the future, it seems to me that
                            it is of great importance that we demonstrate that such agreements can
                            be effective and fully sustained.</p>

                                Vientiane, July 31, the Department suggested that there was for the
                                moment “a certain balance of force” in the critical north-central
                                part of Laos. The <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN forces would
                                probably absorb the shock of Operation Triangle and wait to apply
                                military counterpressure, especially in the face of enhanced T–28
                                capability and Thai support of the Royal Lao Government. If this
                                analysis was correct, the Department thought it likely the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> would negotiate with Souvanna in a
                                tripartite context looking toward a 14-nation conference.

                            several months we have military and political programs to follow which
                            inevitably inter-relate and interact on each other in obvious ways,
                            nevertheless I will discuss them separately. Common background for both
                            is assumption that if possible we would still prefer to realize
                            something along lines Geneva solution mapped out 1962 and that our
                            current firmer words and actions are undertaken in hope they may bring
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>, North Vietnamese, and Chinese
                            into line. If this fails then we will still be seeking equilibrium in
                            which Souvanna and his government could continue survive and hopefully
                            improve situation until opportunity (such as might <pb n="249" xml:id="pg_249" facs="0281"/>come with Vietnamese settlement) opened
                            up for working toward lasting solution, although stronger application
                            force may be required to assure such equilibrium maintained. Is
                            possibility our actions here may meanwhile be deeply affected by
                            requirements of Vietnam situation.</p>

                            goals in foreseeable future. Optimism and overconfidence engendered by

                            combined ground-air operation on Tchepone, etc. US statements about
                            support and our readiness let down some of past barriers and even engage
                            US personnel in limited fashion have revived hopes of ever present “AAR
                            party” in Laos, who would like to resume anti-Communist crusade of early
                            1960's, casting aside Geneva Accords and counting on considerable US
                            military and financial support. Therefore, we must now make abundantly
                            clear we do not support goal retaking all Laos by force of arms or even
                            quite justifiable objective of cleaning Viet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName> out of country. They should understand what we do
                            support is steady strengthening of positions through political, social,
                            economic as well as military programs, to be sure in first place this
                            zone can be held securely. Meanwhile current efforts toward negotiated
                            solution should be given full chance to work out equilibrium,
                            conceivably with strengthened <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or

                        <p>Once we and Lao understand each other on limits of our current military
                            goals then we should study carefully what areas beyond those immediate
                            tasks already mentioned deserve first priority treatment to assure solid
                            defense of free Laos.</p>
                        <p>Where else should there be carried through carefully prepared and well
                            supported action such as Operation Triangle which would consolidate
                            territory free Laos and make it easier defend without predictably
                            provoking enemy reaction beyond power of national forces to contain?
                            Given our special interests in corridor question this study should also
                            consider what actions can be taken there. Without pretending to give any
                            final or all-inclusive answers, following kinds of operations illustrate
                            point: retake Tha Thom, retake Nhommarath and Mahaxay, secure triangle
                            Pakse-Attopeu-Saravane, secure Mekong for traffic Ban Houei Sai-Luang
                            Prabang-Vientiane, reestablish Meo in at least some of areas east of

                            forces which could assure maintenance of order in country if there is no
                            significant outside interference. This should envisage forces adapted to
                            country's terrain and lack of infra-structure and geared as far as
                            possible to its financial possibilities over long run. Once plans for

                            hence) and assuming no successful negotiated settlement reached interim,
                            then serious consideration can begin to be given to gradual
                            reestablishment <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> authority throughout
                            country. Realistically, however, not much can be accomplished in this

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political</p>
                        <p>Immediate political goal is holding of tripartite meeting; preferably
                            Switzerland. Admittedly we do not expect such meeting to achieve
                            anything and we recognize in atmosphere of such a meeting there may be
                            difficulties keeping Souvanna from making risky concession on his
                            preconditions. Nevertheless, meeting offers only means of containing
                            pressures for 14-nation conference, and at same time opportunity for
                            establishing defensible basis for rejecting 14-nation conference when it
                            clear <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> will not meet Souvanna's
                            preconditions and, perhaps, will insist on entirely unacceptable status
                            for him at conference. Tripartite meeting also gets Souvanna to Europe,
                            after which refreshment he can probably be coaxed on to continue here
                            for further indefinite period.</p>
                        <p>If unexpectedly tripartite meeting “successful” in that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> meet preconditions then we will
                            presumably be ready see 14-nation conference proceed. If not
                            “successful” (or if it proves impossible convene tripartite meeting), as
                            noted we have good case for rejecting that conference and perhaps no
                            further action in international field need be contemplated for time
                            being unless something can be devised which, unlike 14-nation
                            conference, promises some improvement for us. If military situation
                            still dangerous, this might be moment to turn to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council to put Lao problem and Communist
                            violations Geneva Accords before world forum. Depending particularly on
                            Soviet position at that time, this might be done in expectation some
                            effective Security Council action or, more likely, for purpose of
                            showing impossibility controlling situation through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and thereby providing justification for
                            intervention by SEATO powers or the like.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile in Vientiane there is ever present risk of Government being
                            upset by one or other irresponsible group and of single voice commanding
                            international respect which Souvanna now represents being dissipated
                            into a confusion of extreme groups calling for massive military solution
                            along lines of anti-Communist crusade with strong support from US,
                            including ground forces as in past. It will be essential for us here <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0283"/>to make clear that US support
                            will not be forthcoming for such irresponsible groups.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing military and political program rests on continuance what has
                            been our settled line on Laos at least since 1961. Needless to say if
                            because of Vietnam situation or other larger policy considerations basic
                            lines of our thinking have been changed, then what is outlined above
                            also would require modification. Plan is admittedly for immediate
                            future, a limited policy which promises no full solution but which seeks
                            to avoid either loss of free Laos (within about present limits) to
                            Communists or substantial involvement of US forces in fighting in
                            Laos.</p>

                            could crumble in any of many ways. Two good possibilities are a strong
                                <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> counteroffensive in response
                            to Operation Triangle and/or a Rightist coup. However, a general

                            unlikely in this period. (A Communist counteroffensive in the Muong Sui
                            area would face the US with an immediate demand for greater US military
                            involvement in Laos. A Rightist coup would send present US policy back

                        <p>In reply to idea Soviet Union should bear special responsibility Laos and
                            to call not to withdraw from Co-Chairmanship, what more can be added to
                            Soviet statement July 26? Efforts as Co-Chairman constantly blocked by
                            actions of others in violation Agreements. Must admit efforts
                            Co-Chairmen remain fruitless.</p>
                        <p>Recall that following Vientiane coup in April situation deteriorated
                            further. Co-Chairmen made recommendations to restore situation, to renew
                            cooperation three political forces. Nothing done to change situation.
                            Hard to believe <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could not have
                            exerted influence on Souvanna and Nosavan in order restore situation
                            accordance Geneva Agreements. Increasingly obvious two not three
                            political forces acting in Laos. “<persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> has lost his identity, he has in fact ceased to be
                            the representative of the neutralist forces.”</p>
                        <p>Although you wrote in principle you do not object to new Geneva
                            Conference US puts forth preconditions for such a conference and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and others follow suit. This approach
                            unrealistic. If one side insists on preconditions other can do same. For
                            example one might demand Nosavan pull back his troops to previous
                            positions. Or that situation be restored to that existing before coup.
                            Such a view not unfounded. Such approach would clearly make impossible
                            convening conference. Who is to say whose troops occupied what and when?
                            Impracticable to advance preconditions you recommend.</p>
                        <p>You write this is what Souvanna demands. Do not dispute but would say
                            “from our standpoint such a demand merely confirms that <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0285"/>

                            remove obstacles to convening conference on Laos. Otherwise Soviet Union
                            will have to consider question relinquishing Co-Chairman's functions

                        <p>At 3 AM today <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Cy Vance</persName> informed me
                            that a T–28 with a Thai pilot was down in eastern Laos. The pilot had
                            been seen to parachute, and air cover for a rescue operation was
                            requested. Vance and I agreed that in the light of your judgment last
                            week, this should be authorized, and a limited four-plane cover was
                            approved for the remaining daylight hours (up to about 7 or 8 this
                            morning, our time.)</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, on his
                            own initiative, authorized a T–28 napalm strike in support of the
                            rescue, with civilian American pilots aboard for control and
                                management.<note n="2" xml:id="d122fn2">As reported in telegram 314

                                27 LAOS) In telegram 171 to Vientiane, August 18, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> informed <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> that use of American pilots in
                                T–28's or other combat roles had to be authorized by Washington.

                        <p>In executing the attempted rescue, a U.S. helicopter with an American
                            pilot was shot down. Fortunately the pilot and crew of this helicopter
                            were rescued by another helicopter. One of the fighter pilots covering
                            the operation flamed out over Thailand, but the pilot ejected and has
                            been rescued in good condition.</p>
                        <p>Finally, one of the T–28s covering the attempted rescue appears to have
                            hit heavy weather in quite another sector of Laos. The plane is down but
                            the pilot is believed to have parachuted safely. (The nationality of
                            this pilot is Thai.)</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, it is believed that the two Thais in the original T–28 have
                            escaped into the brush and may be in the hands of friendly Mao [Meo]
                            tribesmen.</p>
                        <p>The net of this somewhat messy operation is that no Americans are lost,
                            as far as we know, although the one helicopter pilot has been severely
                            wounded.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> and I agree that T–28
                            operations and attendant contingency rescue planning need intense and
                            immediate review, and that review is beginning. A particular problem is
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> authorized
                            American civilian pilots in the T–28s against explicit Washington orders
                            to the contrary. He was acting in an emergency situation, and it may
                            well be that we have held him on too tight a guideline here, but a
                            direct issue of action without authority does exist. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName> and I will try to bring you a
                            more complete report on this aspect at lunch Wednesday.<note n="3" xml:id="d122fn3">August 19. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met with <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>,

                            various possibilities and problems associated with action in Laos

                        <p>(1) [<hi rend="italic">10 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>(2) It was considered that intelligence emanating from Kha operations in
                            southern panhandle, particularly on movements of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> personnel, units and material would be useful asset to
                            feed directly into Vietnamese operational units along Lao-Vietnam
                            frontier. When such intelligence adequately developed, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Vientiane will notify <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Saigon, which will arrange with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> to have direct communications linkage
                            established from Kha teams to proper <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units.</p>
                        <p>(3) Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> agreed that
                            shallow ground penetration by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            units would be acceptable into sparsely populated areas of Laos
                            contemplated by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> “bridgehead” east of Chavane and
                            west of Dak Prou (this is I Corps area and middle bridgehead of three
                            which <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> has proposed). Penetrations
                            would have to be limited to about twenty kilometers and should involve
                            absolute minimum of air support or resupply. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> will crank this acceptability factor into its plans on
                            assumption operation could be conducted without active concurrence of
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(4) There was considerable discussion re feasibility larger scale
                            operations on Route 9 into which “bridgehead” concept being discussed
                            between <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_JGS1">JGS</gloss> could be fitted. Concept discussed
                            would contemplate Lao units, heavily assisted by Thai, moving eastward
                            from Eno through Phalane, while another Lao unit (replacement for
                            current Lao Bao volunteer battalion 33) heavily assisted by <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>, moved west from Lao Bao putting
                            squeeze on Muong Phine-Tchepone segment of Route 9. It was considered
                            that such an exercise would hit Viet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName>/Pathet Lao in their most sensitive spot, and
                            therefore large and instantaneous Viet Minh reaction would have to be
                            anticipated.</p>
                        <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>Such an operation would require the use of substantial forces up to two
                            or three battalions and would also require close air support. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stated that operations
                            of this magnitude could not be hidden; that the Pathet Lao/Viet
                                <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName> would put heavy pressure
                            on Souvanna and that unless US gave Souvanna a guarantee of support by
                            US air and possibly ground forces, such an operation would be
                            unacceptable in terms our relations with <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> made same point with respect Thai participation.
                            Consequently, we could not initiate such an action on a significant
                            scale unless we were willing to give the Thai, the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> assurances that we would move in rapidly with US
                            military support, either air or ground, or both, to extricate them from
                            anything bigger than they could handle with their own resources.</p>
                        <p>It was considered, how that the fact of planning by itself for such an
                            operation, mutually conducted through US intermediation, but involving
                            Thai, Vietnamese and some Lao participation, could have healthy
                            repercussions, both on the present situation and for the longer future,
                            and should therefore not be rejected. Moreover, some more limited
                            actions in this region, involving Thai and Vietnamese encadrement, but
                            not to exceed hit and run type operations, might prove feasible. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> will examine this further with view
                            making recommendations.</p>
                        <p>(5) More limited <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ground operations
                            near Route 9, of company size, probably airborne, and probably building
                            on the Leaping Lena<note n="2" xml:id="d123fn2">Leaping Lena, code name

                            experience, were also discussed. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> expressed considerable reservation about such
                            plans as well as re larger <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            “bridgehead” plans in this area and doubted Souvanna would accept them
                            under any foreseeable circumstances. He would, however, reserve
                            definitive comment until he could examine specific proposals, such as
                            those which might be mounted along the route from Route 9 to Muong Nong.
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> will prepare specific
                            proposals which will be submitted for examination, including Embassy
                            Vientiane.</p>
                        <p>(6) In discussion possible air action in the panhandle, Embassy Vientiane
                            reps reported that General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>,
                            Chief of Lao Air Force, has examined twenty military targets suggested
                            by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, in corridor
                            area south Mugia Pass and expressed willingness attack them with Lao
                            T–28 force. Was willing assign ten planes to this action, and felt that,
                            with good weather, could accomplish task in ten days of operations.</p>
                        <p>Because it is believed some of these targets are protected beyond
                            capability of Lao pilots to penetrate, it was agreed that Embassy
                            Vientiane would examine target list, designate those targets which it
                            felt <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> capable of handling, and

                        <p>(9) In discussion <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> air capabilities,
                            question arose re possible augmentation its current strength. Two
                            methods were proposed (a) augmentation T–28 force by assignment
                            remaining T–28's now in Vietnam as soon as A–1–E's arrive in country,
                            (B) assignment <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> aircraft (A–1–H)
                            and pilots to Laos, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not

                            appropriate recommendations.</p>
                        <p>In considering all the foregoing conclusions and recommendations, an
                            effort was made to strike a balance between military desirability and
                            political acceptability. Conferees were keenly aware of need to avoid
                            precipitation of a major political debacle (such as resignation of
                            Souvanna) by overzealous pursuit of conspicuous military actions which
                            might, in practice, have only marginal benefits to situation in Vietnam.
                            Therefore the scope of agreed operations (both ground and air) which was
                            considered feasible fell short of this which would represent the most
                            effective military action within the capability of friendly forces.
                            Finally, however, it was recognized that even the maximum action of
                            which currently available friendly forces would be capable probably
                            falls considerably short of being truly effective as a military solution
                            to the panhandle problem.</p>

                            But we might be able to justify before US and international public use

                            (e.g. Yankee team) while withholding use jet fliers for rescue <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> or Thai pilots. I am convinced,
                            however, that such distinction would seriously cripple morale of Thais,
                            who have borne far greatest brunt of air operations in <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> area, and of AA pilots, who regularly
                            expose themselves to great risks.</p>
                        <p>Even if Muong Soui area is stabilized and no counter-attacks in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> occur there, or elsewhere, we still

                            must play important role. Moreover we must maintain strength which
                            continued T–28 operations provide for <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> in current negotiations. Risks involved
                            in all air operations over Laos are considerable, including little
                            publicized regular civilian and military supply operations. Since Jan 1
                            there have been more than 40 ground fire attacks (much small calibre)
                            against transport, passenger and helicopter aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Many operations such as straight-line dive at targets using the [?] make
                            T–28 aircraft particularly vulnerable. With its many limitations, T–28
                            cannot employ less hazardous attack patterns of more modern
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Recent losses of T–28s—three in past few days—as well as helicopter and
                            US jet point up enemy capabilities. Nevertheless, recent losses might be
                            regarded as law of averages catching up after extended period of low
                            loss rate. Since May 17, when T–28 activities expanded, RLAF had flown
                            1543 combat sorties, many against heavily-defended targets, e.g. Ban
                            Khan bridge, Phou Kout area, <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>. Yet
                            during this period only four T–28s lost to enemy ground fire and one
                            lost to weather. Lost rate .0032 percent very low.</p>
                        <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>As reftel points out T–28s have proved be decisive factor in recent
                            military operations. They have carried out air operations to destroy
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> bases, interdict supply lines,
                            provide close support for ground operations and provide visual and photo
                            recce. They have also played important role <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> operations. In many respects amount and effectiveness
                            hostile fire here is much greater than in South Viet-Nam. Present enemy
                            antiaircraft capabilities include 37mm towed; twin-mount 14.5mm mg's in
                            open-topped armored cars; vehicle- and tripod-mounted 12.7 machine guns;
                            and 7.62mm machine guns at all echelons. All these weapons are mobile
                            and are present in areas of key importance such as eastern area adjacent
                            Phou Kout, Xieng Khouang ville, Muong Panh. We believe on basis attack
                            patterns that 57mm may also be present in some areas.</p>

                            procedures for handling such requests call for processing them through a
                            number of command echelons with a consequent delay in obtaining the
                            necessary action.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> therefore recommends that
                            the tactical commander on the scene be given the authority to respond to
                            requests for <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> support by the U.S.
                            Ambassador without having to obtain authority from Washington. The
                            chances for successful rescue are best if the <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> attempt is made before the enemy has time to react
                            effectively, and the downed pilot is still in good physical condition.
                            When jet aircraft support is needed, the sooner it can be provided the
                            more certain it is that the actual helicopter rescue can be made with
                            minimum risk to all involved, as the surprise, speed, and force of the
                            attack will have greater effect against unorganized opposition. Also, it
                            is generally believed that failure to provide the U.S. jet fighter “cap”
                            when a Lao or Thai pilot is lost—when it is clear that we would use such
                            a cap if the pilot were American—would give a very bad impression to our
                            allies.</p>

                        <p>At same time, we believe time has come to review scope and control
                            arrangements for T–28 operations extending into future. Such a review is
                            especially indicated view fact that these operations more or less
                            automatically impose demands for use of US personnel in <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> operations. Moreover, increase AA
                            capability clearly means possibilities of loss somewhat increased, and
                            each loss with accompanying <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss>
                            operations involves chance of escalation from one action to another in
                            ways that may not be desirable in wider picture. On other side, we
                            naturally recognize T–28 operations are vital both for their military
                            and psychological effects in Laos and as negotiating card in support of
                            Souvanna's position. Request your view whether balance of above factors
                            would call for some reduction in scale of operations and/or dropping of
                            some of better-defended targets. (Possible extension T–28 operations to

                        <p>1. Pursuant to your direction my staff has been engaged with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in efforts to arrive

                            Attack on Panhandle Targets”. After several exchanges of memorandums and
                            some conversation, I cannot agree to the concept expressed by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> as set forth in his
                            memorandum of 25 Aug (Att 1).<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">In this
                                memorandum, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                                suggested a three-pronged strategy for air attacks on the Laos
                                panhandle. First, air attacks by <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> T–28's supplemented by U.S. armed reconnaissance
                                aircraft. Second, air support of ground operations by Vietnamese and
                                Farmgate aircraft depending on the nature of the ground operations.
                                Third, <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> attacks on targets of opportunity
                                in the panhandle, such as convoys, in conjunction with attacks on
                                North Vietnam so long as there was “convincing evidence” that these
                                were North Vietnamese and not Lao targets. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Militarily, the situation in the RVN no longer permits us to allow the
                                <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> to benefit from unrestricted use
                            of infiltration routes and centers in the Laos Panhandle.</p>
                        <p>2. I consider the capability of the Laotian Air Force to neutralize or
                            seriously damage the 22 infiltration associated targets identified in
                            Laos to be negligible. I further believe that political consideration in
                            Laos will not permit the R.L.G. to acquiesce in or direct a meaningful
                            attack within a time-span appropriate to the military situation in the
                            Republic of Vietnam. I also do not believe credible and militarily
                            effective attacks against these targets can be launched by recce escort
                            aircraft in the role of flak suppression. One target, Tchepone Army
                            Barracks, requires 68 sorties for an acceptable degree of
                            destruction.</p>
                        <p>3. I therefore urgently advocate the only feasible course of action
                            available to us with forces available for attacks on Laos Panhandle
                            infiltration targets. This is air attack by <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>/Farmgate forces. We have developed complete attack
                            plans for the six principal targets which call for 154 sorties of A–1E/H
                            aircraft. These targets have been approved by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> for combined planning with the
                                <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> (<gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>). Specific authorization from you to conduct such
                            planning has not been granted.</p>
                        <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0296"/>
                        <p>4. I believe that the basis for an excellent moral and political
                            justification for the concept which I advocate rests in the following
                            considerations:</p>
                        <p>a. The right of self defense in the face of a desperate threat.</p>
                        <p>b. The targets are illegal <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> enclaves
                            in Laos and constitute an invasion by the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> of the Sovereign territory of Laos for purposes of
                            supporting efforts to overthrow by force the Government of Vietnam with
                            which the R.L.G. is at peace.</p>
                        <p>5. With respect to paragraph 3 of the attached memorandum<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">Paragraph 3 of <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s memorandum of August 25 discussed air
                                support for ground operations.</note> this is a mode of attack that
                            may provide the pretext for the results we seek. However, it would not
                            be timely and the weight and location of attacks would be out of the
                            context of credible requirements of the military situations likely to
                            develop.</p>
                        <p>6. Reference paragraph 4 of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s memorandum,<note n="4" xml:id="d128fn4">Paragraph 4 discussed the attacks on targets of opportunity in
                                Laos.</note> I do not concur that <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>/Farmgate actions against targets in Laos should be
                            tied to a decision to attack the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> if
                            there is likely to be any delay in such a decision. Every day, to the
                            best of our knowledge, the illegal entry of the enemy into the RVN
                            continues through the Laotian targets. This in turn makes the
                            pacification task in the RVN that much more difficult, costly and
                            time-consuming.</p>
                        <p>7. I request that you grant approval for US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> combined planning for air attack on the following
                            targets, initially:</p>

                        <p>b. Ben Thay Military Camp and 4 <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss>

                        <p>f. Ban Trim Barracks and Supply Area (34 Sorties)</p>
                        <p>These targets are clearly identifiable, separated from civilian
                            communities and definitely in support of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration into the RVN. Subject to appropriate
                            review of plans, I urge you seek authority to launch these attacks.</p>

                            <item>Rules of Engagement (U)</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The US Ambassador to Laos has requested that a revision be made in the
                            Rules of Engagement to permit US aircraft to engage hostile aircraft
                            over Laos without prior reference to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>2. Recently the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized certain changes in the
                            Rules of Engagement for Southeast Asian countries and, inter alia,
                            specifically authorized the protection of US forces operating in Laos
                            but excluded friendly Lao forces.</p>
                        <p>3. The reason for this exclusion of coverage was that in discussions with
                            the Department of State they felt it was premature to request permission
                            of the Lao Prime Minister to furnish protection to the friendly Lao
                            forces. During inter-agency discussions on the above mentioned Rules of
                            Engagement, it was concluded that consultation with the Lao Prime
                            Minister concerning protection of friendly Lao forces by US forces would
                            be deferred.</p>
                        <p>4. The United States has expended considerable effort, time, and funds in
                            support of the friendly Lao forces. The introduction of the additional
                            T–28s and support that have been provided to the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> enabled them to undertake offensive actions for the
                            first time in a number of years. The introduction of tactical air in
                            support of the Pathet Lao might degrade a favorable situation that now
                            exists. Consequently, the air superiority in support of the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>5. To intercept hostile aircraft effectively over Lao territory and
                            protect this investment, it is necessary for the US forces in Thailand
                            to react immediately upon receipt of a hostile aircraft warning. To
                            request authority from the Joint Chiefs to Staff to engage hostile
                            aircraft and await a reply after receiving a hostile aircraft warning
                            nullifies effective air defense.</p>
                        <p>6. The Commander in Chief, Pacific, concurred in the need for air defense
                            and recommended definitive rules of engagement be established for
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that:</p>
                        <p>a. Authority should be granted US forces to engage hostile aircraft over
                            Laos without prior reference to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>b. Definitive rules of engagement be established for Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>8. The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend approval of the attached
                                message<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">Attached, but not printed. In a

                                undertaken in the near future, together with Lao air strikes as soon
                                as we can get Souvanna's permission. These operations will have
                                limited effect, however.” (Ibid., p. 748) This recommendation to the

                            limited but probably useful land and air operations in corridor.</p>
                        <p>1) Land operations. Shallow penetration raids (20 kms) in central area
                            (toward Chavane), Rte 9 area (as well as Leaping Lena Teams in Rte 9
                            area) and probing operation in the southern area near Cambodian frontier
                            by company-sized units do not in my mind require any clearance by the
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. We would assume they could be
                            carried out as soon as the <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> ground and
                            support units are in state of readiness. Here we are thinking of minimum
                            indispensable air support which would be based on <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> for all supply, evacuation and
                            emergency operations over Laos, as was agreed on at Saigon. This would
                            envisage US advisor role limited to accompanying Leaping Lena Teams in

                        <p>2) Air operations. Thus far lack of specific instructions has inhibited
                            us from pressing <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> on initiation T–28
                            strikes in corridor, but if Washington desires, believe we can persuade
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military to agree that
                            individual strikes can be started on this quite soon, although large
                            scale concentrated program will probably have to await Souvanna's return
                            from Paris. His reaction would probably depend on degree of agreement
                            there among Lao factions. We would probably have to give <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> assurances of adequate support if such
                            actions brought about sharp enemy response that appeared beyond
                            capability Lao armed forces to withstand. We might also be asked give
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> further support in northern and
                                <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> operations. Souvanna would
                            probably prefer see air attacks against corridor targets extended over
                            period of time, perhaps three to four weeks, rather than massive attack
                            designed to eliminate all targets within three or four day period. As
                            for difficult targets, particularly several bridges in the corridor
                            area, these might be left to Yankee Team “suppressive missions” which
                            could be got underway shortly. I do not think it would be necessary for
                            me to tell <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> that
                            such Yankee Team strikes were being undertaken if number of aircraft
                            engaged in any such operation were kept within pattern present Yankee
                                <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0301"/>Team flights. For example,
                            flights of perhaps four “escort” fighters could be readily passed off as
                            suppressive strike.</p>

                        <p>Suggestions outlined above for corridor operations clearly do not meet
                            all military desiderata, but have advantage that they could be
                            undertaken almost immediately. More effective military program could run
                            into significant political difficulties (reviewed in previous messages)
                            and delays. In undertaking this program we should recognize that
                            operations outlined above are designed to provide shot in arm to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> armed forces as well as further signal to
                            enemy of seriousness our intentions. On other hand, cutting off corridor
                            so that passage of personnel and materiel from north to south would be
                            substantially reduced or eliminated is generally accepted, I believe, as
                            being beyond capabilities <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>, to say
                            nothing of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military, even with any

                        <p>2. It is noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> predicates his proposals on two assumptions: (1)
                            no ceasefire, and (2) no major enemy offensive. The concept of
                            employment of the Lao forces as proposed by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> is as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. First phase (September–November)—consolidate the gains of Operation
                            Triangle; clear out Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>)
                            pockets (1) south and west of Luang Prabang, (2) north and northeast of
                            Vientiane, and (3) in the western portion of south Laos from Savannakhet
                            to the Cambodian border; and conduct operations to place pressure on the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> in the vicinity of Tha Thom and
                            improve defenses against an enemy advance south towards Paksane.</p>
                        <p>b. Second phase (November–February)—following the cleanup of the first
                            phase, troops in south Laos move to a line east of Phalane, Nong Bua Lao
                            (but west of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> base at Muong Phine),
                            15 kilometers east of Saravane and Attopeu, and south to approximately
                            20 kilometers of the Cambodian border.</p>
                        <p>3. The above concept closely parallels the actions approved by the
                            President for implementation and the concepts for selected offensive
                            actions provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>4. Analysis of the proposed actions indicates that they are within the
                            capabilities of the Lao forces. The opposing orders of battle in south
                            Laos are: <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>—30 battalions with
                            artillery and air support and Pathet Lao/Viet Minh (<gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss>)—14 battalions (10 <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and 4 VM). Since the concepts of July
                            1963 were prepared, Lao forces have achieved a somewhat improved
                            posture, particularly as a result of the augmented and battle tested
                            Royal Lao Air Force (<gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>), but also as
                            a result of enhanced esprit, increased training, and US assistance. This
                            improved posture does not, however, extend to the point that the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> or Neutralist forces can be relied upon
                            when confronted by North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>5. The operations envisaged would serve to keep pressure on the enemy,
                            would tend to inhibit the Lao from initiating actions in the north
                            beyond their capability to handle, and could well have a diversionary
                            effect in support of South Vietnamese cross-border operations into
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>6. Operations of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>, which are
                            essential to success, should not involve such a commitment that they
                            cannot respond to a <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> attack
                            elsewhere, such as toward Thakhek. It is noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> mentions the establishment of a
                            special Air Operations Center (<gloss target="#t_AOC1">AOC</gloss>) at
                            Savannakhet. It is considered that the proper air control agency in
                            south Laos should be an Air Support Operations Center (<gloss target="#t_ASOC1">ASOC</gloss>) at Savannakhet, subordinate to the
                                <gloss target="#t_AOC1">AOC</gloss> at Vientiane, the latter
                            allocating aircraft consistent with the over-all priorities for the air
                            effort in Laos.</p>
                        <p>7. Operations in southern Laos will require coordination with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> and the Republic of Vietnam
                            Armed Forces (<gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss>), and with <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operations. It is noted that RVN
                            liaison in Laos has been established and that the Army Attaché has
                            recognized the need for liaison <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0303"/>with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_ASOC1">ASOC</gloss> at Savannakhet should be the air
                            control agency in Laos with which the <gloss target="#t_AOC1">AOC</gloss> at Tan Son Nhut could coordinate to achieve integration
                            of air actions in the Laos corridor in the event <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss>/Farmgate/US air strikes therein are
                            mounted from South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>8. The degree of US participation and assistance is not clear. The US
                            Army Attaché's message CX–450, <gloss target="#t_DTG1">DTG</gloss>

                            indicates that US advisors will be required at three command posts and
                            also in a logistical and artillery advisory capacity.</p>
                        <p>9. The Joint Chiefs of Staff concur in the concept outlined herein and
                            recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. The United States support these modest operations in view of the gains
                            to be expected.</p>
                        <p>b. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> be queried on
                            the anticipated military personnel and equipment requirements discussed
                            in paragraphs 6, 7, and 8, above, and the degree of US participation and
                            assistance required, in order that the Joint Chiefs of Staff can address
                            these requirements.</p>

                            Neutralists would be sufficient window-dressing to meet Souvanna's most
                            embarrassing (to them) precondition. The Pathet Lao's adamant refusal to
                            (1) permit <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> inspection of the area
                            and (2) allow <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>'s own
                            troops to reoccupy their former positions on the Plain clearly exposed
                            their continued intransigence, and Souvanna rejected the proposal. In
                            addition, the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> will only accept
                            Souvanna as titular leader of a non-governmental delegation to a

                        <p>There are indications the French devised this scheme for the Pathet Lao.
                            In any case, French officials have employed massive pressure tactics to
                            force Souvanna to accept the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> proposal
                            and agree to a 14-nation conference without preconditions. Initially,
                            the French disclaimed any intent to interfere, but as no progress
                            developed toward the 14-nation conference which General <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">De Gaulle</persName> desires, high-level French
                            officials have become deeply involved. They have openly supported the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> position and have been
                            disingenuous in their dealings with us. Ambassador Alphand called on the
                            Secretary September 16, requesting that the US help pressure Souvanna to
                                agree.<note n="2" xml:id="d133fn2">Recorded in a September 16
                                memorandum of conversation. (Ibid.)</note> The Secretary rejoined
                            that acceptance of the Pathet Lao proposal would amount to capitulation
                            to the Communists. Souvanna has so far stood firm and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> and his staff in Paris
                            are maintaining close contact with Souvanna and company to bolster their
                            resistance as necessary. The French are reportedly furious over the
                            failure of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> proposal and blame us
                            for Souvanna's opposition to it.</p>

                        <p>On October 7, 1964, the special powers granted the Government of National
                            Union of Laos by the National Assembly expire. Failure of the Assembly
                            to renew these powers could lead to a governmental crisis. In <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0306"/>such an event the Souvanna
                            government might be forced to resign followed by strong pressures for a
                            new government excluding the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>. Our
                            latest information indicates, however, that General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and the Sananikones, whose
                            rivalry for power figures intimately in the special powers issue, are
                            prepared to go along with a request from Souvanna for renewal, thus
                            avoiding a governmental crisis. However, the renewal can only extend
                            until next spring when the Assembly's term expires. The constitutional
                            requirement for national elections will then become a crucial issue.
                            Here again, however, it is likely that a compromise can be worked out
                            postponing elections.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>In October 1962, the Lao National Assembly granted Souvanna's Government
                            of National Union special powers for one year to govern without
                            reference to the National Assembly. These powers were renewed for
                            another year in October 1963. They expire on October 7, 1964.</p>
                        <p>There was not much difficulty in 1962 in obtaining Assembly agreement to
                            grant the special powers and thus give the coalition government the
                            opportunity to carry out its mission. At that time the possibility
                            existed that the objectives of the Lao tripartite agreements for
                            national reconciliation and unification could be achieved under the
                            Geneva settlement. Moreover, the 1961 Zurich communiqué between the
                            three princes, the basic agreement underlying the coalition government,
                            had provided that the provisional Government of National Union would be
                            formed without reference to the National Assembly. (This was necessary
                            because neither the Pathet Lao nor, at that time, the neutralists
                            recognized the Assembly, claiming it was created by “rigged” elections
                            in 1960.) Before renewing the special powers in October 1963, questions
                            were raised in the National Assembly as to whether this should be done
                            since the coalition government had made no progress toward achieving its
                            objectives. Nevertheless, as a sign of support for Souvanna, the special
                            powers were renewed on the condition that Souvanna report to the
                            Assembly on the results of the trip he had just made to France, the
                            United States, the United Nations, England and the U.S.S.R.</p>
                        <p>Last May a dispute arose over the interpretation of the period for which
                            special powers had been granted in October 1963. Some argued that the
                            period extended only from the time the Assembly recessed, after granting
                            special powers, to its reconvening in May. Others argued the powers has
                            been granted until October 1964. The latter view finally prevailed but
                            the dispute foreshadowed the likelihood of a battle in the Assembly over
                            renewal in October.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rivalry Among Conservatives</p>
                        <p>The Assembly is dominated by the conservatives, although there are some
                            neutralist (but no <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>) Deputies. Its
                            President is <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui Sananikone</persName> who
                            controls a large bloc of Deputies. Another large bloc is subject to
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s control. The
                            rivalry between the Sananikones and <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> for general control of the conservative faction
                            has been increasingly intense, especially since April 19, 1964. Before
                            the attempted coup Phoumi was pretty much in the saddle, despite latent
                            divisions and rivalries among the conservatives. The Sananikones up to
                            that point were fairly inactive politically. Phoui, leader of the clan,
                            emerged from semi-retirement in May 1963, when he was elected President
                            of the Assembly, and began to take a more active interest in affairs of
                            state. At first these activities appeared to be constructive and in
                            support of Souvanna and his policies. For example, <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> supported the formation of a
                            parliamentary group which made trips around the country to areas
                            accessible to the government, in support of Souvanna and the policy of
                            neutrality. It thus appeared that at last all important non-communist
                            elements in Laos were uniting behind and in support of Souvanna—the hope
                            we had when we signed the Geneva Agreements.</p>
                        <p>It was not long, however, before rumors began to circulate in Vientiane
                            that the Sananikones again had ambitions of their own for political
                            leadership. On several occasions Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> had talks with <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> to ensure he understood that the United States
                            supported Souvanna and the Geneva settlement and that we would not view
                            with approval any attempt to upset existing arrangements. <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> always agreed and affirmed his
                            support for this policy. Earlier this year, however, it began to become
                            clear that the Sananikones were no longer satisfied to take a back seat.
                            There is no question that they took advantage of the growing discontent
                            and frustrations of the conservatives not only with the Government of
                            National Union but also with <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s monopoly of conservative leadership. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> remained behind the
                            scenes and tried to appear non-involved, his brother Oun (also a Deputy)
                            was very much involved in the attempted coup last April.</p>
                        <p>While the coup failed to achieve its purpose of upsetting the Government
                            of National Union, it did succeed in diminishing the power and influence
                            of General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and reasserting
                            an influential role for the Sananikones. However, it still did not put
                            the Sananikones in a position of unchallenged leadership of the
                            conservative faction. This has been particularly disappointing to Oun
                                <persName>Sananikone</persName>, the real troublemaker in the
                            clan.</p>

                            Sananikones another opportunity to strengthen their political position.

                            renew the special powers, Souvanna's government will be vulnerable to a
                            no-confidence vote forcing its resignation. Various conservatives,
                            including the Sananikones, and even some neutralists, have made it clear
                            they see no purpose in continuing with the Government of National Union.
                            They favor reorganization of the government to exclude the Pathet Lao
                            completely. This the attempted coup had hoped to achieve but only
                            succeeded instead, because of United States and other international
                            opposition, in obtaining replacement of dissident neutralist cabinet
                            members and, subsequently, of certain conservative members.</p>
                        <p>Various proposals have been put forth concerning reorganization of the
                            government. One would have the King or Crown Prince assume the powers of
                            the premiership but it is unlikely the King would agree to this. Another
                            would have the King reappoint Souvanna to form a government excluding
                            the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>. Still another would have the King
                            appoint an unnamed Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Present Status of Special Powers Issue</p>
                        <p>At first <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> indicated he saw no
                            problem with the Assembly's renewing the special powers. Later, however,
                            as his duel with the Sananikones intensified, <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> claimed the mood of the Assembly was such that
                            renewal would not be feasible. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> blamed the Sananikones for this situation and the
                            Sananikones blamed <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>.
                            Nevertheless, largely no doubt as a result of our making it clear we did
                            not favor any attempt to upset the applecart, both <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> are now saying that if Souvanna requests it the
                            Assembly will renew the special powers. We have instructed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> to use his influence as
                            appropriate to ensure that this is done. The King apparently also shares
                            our view there should be no change in the situation. We should know
                            during the course of the week whether there will be difficulties.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Election Issue</p>
                        <p>The Assembly's term expires in April 1965 when, according to the
                            Constitution, new elections must be held. The renewal of special powers
                            would thus be only for the balance of the Assembly's term. The question
                            of the elections also poses a problem since it seems unlikely they can
                            be held under present conditions in Laos. The Lao have been considering
                            this problem and seem to feel the matter can be resolved under a
                            constitutional provision permitting the Assembly, meeting jointly with
                            the King's Council, to suspend, in effect, the constitutional
                            requirement that elections be held every five years. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> is sending us his views
                            on this issue.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Since the Pathet Lao attacks against the Neutralists in April 1963, our
                            service Attaches in Laos have been authorized to become increasingly
                            involved in activities which go beyond those normally carried out by
                            Attaches, approaching a military advisory role. In the summer of 1963 we
                            increased the size of our Attaché staffs (this applies to the Army and
                            Air Force, since the Naval Attaches are resident in Bangkok). Again this
                            past summer, because of Pathet Lao attacks on the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> in May, we increased the number of
                            United States military personnel in Laos in connection with the defense
                            of Muong Soui and to support Operation Triangle. Most of these temporary
                            personnel have since been withdrawn. However, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel engaged in support of T–28 activities still
                            operate in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Most of the army and air personnel mentioned above carry the title of
                            Assistant Army or Assistant Air Attaché. They are so notified to the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs when they enter Laos, although not all of
                            their names appear on the diplomatic list. We understand that although
                            there is a general awareness in the Vientiane community, including the
                            diplomatic and foreign press corps, that there is a larger number of
                            United States military Attaches in Laos at present than before May 1964,
                            the exact number is not known to them. It is quite possible that, in the
                            event of any <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> investigation of
                            Communist charges alleging a United States military presence in Laos in
                            violation of the Geneva Agreements, there might be witnesses who could
                            testify about the participation of United States personnel in military
                            operations, particularly around Muong Soui. You have recently signed a
                            telegram to Embassy Vientiane stating our basic position in such a
                            contingency.</p>
                        <p>A summary of the numbers and status of United States military personnel
                            now in Laos follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Army Attaché Office</p>
                        <p>Authorized complement—nine officers, one warrant officer and
                            approximately 28 enlisted men. In addition to normal attaché duties, <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0310"/>these personnel travel
                            throughout <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>-held areas consulting
                            with, advising and, to some extent, training Lao military forces. One
                            officer is stationed at Muong Soui.</p>
                        <p>Eight additional officers were introduced on a temporary duty basis in
                            connection with the defense of Muong Soui and Operation Triangle. All
                            but one of these have departed Laos. A further temporary augmentation
                            was authorized recently but has not yet taken place. This provides for a
                            team of six officers to form a mobile training team for a period of
                            twelve weeks. One of the main purposes of this program is to build up a
                            corps of United States officers with Lao experience who would be
                            available in the event of another emergency requiring direct United
                            States involvement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Air Attaché Office</p>
                        <p>Authorized complement—three officers, one of which is stationed at
                            Savannakhet with the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are five (previously nine) officers on temporary duty
                            as Assistant Air Attaches assisting in T–28 activities. Some 25 <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> ground personnel in civilian clothes
                            arm and service the T–28's at Vientiane airfield but return to Udorn,
                            Thailand, every night.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Naval Attaché Office</p>
                        <p>Although resident in Bangkok, these three officers make periodic visits
                            to Laos. One of them (Marine) assisted in artillery training during one
                            of his visits to Muong Soui last summer.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Others</p>
                        <p>A JUSMAG advisor accompanied the Thai group to Muong Soui but it is not
                            clear whether he is still there. Other military personnel have been
                            permitted to enter Laos on a selective and controlled basis during
                            recent months, with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s approval, but great care is taken to keep these
                            visits as inconspicuous as possible.</p>

                            at 4:15 p.m. Two of the five items discussed related to Laos. According
                            to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge Bundy</persName>'s minutes of
                            the meeting:</p>
                        <p>“It was agreed that we would not at present respond affirmatively to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s request for
                            interdiction operations along route 7. We should point out to him that
                            such an operation now would put the onus of escalation upon us. We
                            should not, however, foreclose the possibility of a different decision
                            in the event of renewed hostile activity by the Pathet Lao and Viet
                            Minh.”</p>
                        <p>In the 4th item, according to <persName corresp="#p_BMG1">McGeorge
                                Bundy</persName>'s minutes:</p>
                        <p>“The President agreed to a program of Laotian bombing in the
                            communications corridors of Southern Laos, using the T–28 force now
                            available. The Secretary of Defense pointed out that there was implied
                            in this program a limited use of U.S. fighters, at some stage, for
                            suppressive strikes, but Presidential approval for this part of the
                            program was neither asked nor given.” (Johnson Library, National

                        <p>The other topics discussed were a possible <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> visit to South Vietnam, 34–A operations against

                            <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> reiterated his well-known
                            feeling that (using his own word) present “supple” policy—i.e., one that
                            requires continued political accommodation with Pathet Lao in Government
                            of National Union (1962 Geneva Agreements environment)—and recent
                            pressure for military operations in Panhandle is not fully satisfactory.
                            He clearly believes that stronger policy of military operations in
                            northern Laos, stressing interdiction of Route 7, is called for.</p>
                        <p>This stronger policy could involve not only “occupation” by Lao forces of
                            Nhommarath-Mahaxay area east of Thakhek if necessary, but, more
                            importantly, he said, should require establishment of a “barrier” in the
                            area east of Ban Ban across Route 7 in northern Laos. With this
                            “barrier,” to be accomplished apparently by special forces type units,
                            primarily the Meos and other tribes, using clandestine and subversive
                            guerrilla style tactics presumably, <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> hopes to isolate the PL from NVN support via
                            Route 7 and thus enable the Royal Lao Armed Forces to recover the Plaine
                            des Jarres from the Pathet Lao. He felt the present military
                            realities—e.g., weakened, demoralized state of the PL, the Lao T–28 air
                            strike effectiveness, and growing combat capabilities of Lao special
                            forces made this stronger policy feasible. He indicated Lao could reduce
                            its regular armed forces in order to build up special forces.</p>

                        <p>1. On 30 September 1964, the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided you with
                            their views for implementation of air and ground cross-border operations
                            in the Laos corridor. With regard to the air operations phase, they
                            forwarded an air strike plan for attacks on Viet Cong (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>) infiltration routes and facilities in
                            the Laos Panhandle. They recommended that the targets associated
                            therewith be struck by a mix of Royal Lao Air Force (<gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>) T–28s and US aircraft under a Yankee
                            Team cover. US participation was recommended as follows:</p>
                        <p>a. US air strike hard targets—bridges—and such additional hard targets
                            not suitable for the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> as may be
                            developed.</p>
                        <p>b. US air fly flak-suppression missions for the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> and high cover in the event that Democratic Republic
                            of Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>) aircraft attempt to
                            interfere.</p>
                        <p>2. From a review of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s message of 6 October 1964 (Vientiane to State
                            No. 581) as amplified by the Air Attaché, Vientiane's message of 12
                            October 1964 (<gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> Vientiane

                                been found.</note> the Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted that the
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> has:</p>
                        <p>a. Proposed certain modifications to the target list. The Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff agree with the modifications, including the striking of two
                            targets in Laos west of Mu Gia Pass which the Lao have developed from
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> intelligence sources.</p>
                        <p>b. Requested US air cover for strikes against four of the targets, those
                            close to the North Vietnam/Lao border. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            consider this a proper extension of their recommendation for high cover
                            in the event of interference by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>c. Proposed that Yankee Team jets strike four heavily-defended, high-risk
                            targets. One of these four (Nape bridge) was originally scheduled for a
                            US strike; the other three are among the more important targets. It is
                            noted that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            suggests that US air suppress the <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss>
                            defenses at these targets for T–28 strikes, a proposal in line with the
                            recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0317"/>
                        <p>d. Indicated that they will commence striking 13 targets in Laos on 14
                            October 1964 during an eight-day period, weather permitting. The
                            targets, as indicated in subparagraph 2 a, above, include two that are
                            close to Mu Gia Pass in Laos; the remainder do not include the hard
                            targets for which US strike assistance has been requested (Nape bridge,
                            Tchepone, and Ban Thay). They do include those for which air cover has
                            been requested.</p>
                        <p>3. Only a small portion of the air strike program has to date been
                            approved; namely, strikes by the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            on those targets, excluding Mu Gia Pass, which they are willing to hit
                            without US air cover or fire support. With regard to Mu Gia, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> has indicated that the
                            Lao give Mu Gia Station in Laos a top priority as a critical supply
                            point; he recommends that the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            strike it with US jet cover operating well within Lao territory. The
                            Defense Intelligence Agency considers that the militarily significant
                            target at Mu Gia Pass is in North Vietnam and has detected no military
                            activity at Mu Gia Station. As noted in paragraph 2, above, the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> has developed two targets in this
                            area in Laos.</p>
                        <p>4. In connection with these operations in Laos, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            have recently noted the report of the initial discussions in Saigon of
                            the newly formed SEASIA coordinating group, which expressed unanimous
                            agreement that US participation in the air operations in the corridor is
                            essential if such operations are to have the desired military and
                            psychological impact, particularly since the initiative for the
                            operations came from the United States. Specifically, the group has
                            proposed that the United States reconsider:</p>
                        <p>a. Removing the ban on <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> strikes on
                            Mu Gia,</p>
                        <p>b. Authorizing participation by US air in strikes against the hard
                            targets (which together with Mu Gia are among the most important),
                            and</p>
                        <p>c. Permitting the United States to fly air cover for <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> strikes, as requested by the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. Failure to provide US assistance as requested could result in losses
                            to the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>, both in manpower and
                            aircraft, that would be unacceptable to the Royal Laotian Government
                                (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>). Without assistance in a time
                            of need, the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> could conceivably
                            question US resolve in Laos as well as in Southeast Asia. Similarly, the
                            Government of Thailand could view US reluctance to support Laos as a
                            demonstration of US weakness. US participation in the air operations in
                            Laos is essential to the success of the operation, politically and
                            militarily. Recognition must be given to the fact that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will be sensitive to attacks in the Panhandle and to US
                            participation. Our participation will represent a penetration into a
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> area which has been undisputed
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> territory for the last few years.
                            In addition, air operations in the Laos corridor should be undertaken
                            because of their importance to the over-all effort in South Vietnam. <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0318"/>The situation there, as
                            indicated in <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 53–2–64,<note n="3" xml:id="d140fn3">

                            Stronger, more dynamic, and successful actions by the United States
                            outside of the Republic of Vietnam, which clearly demonstrate our
                            resolve and commitment to support military operations against the common
                            enemy, could well serve as a principal means of arresting this
                            trend.</p>
                        <p>6. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, accordingly, again recommend US
                            participation in the air strike program in the corridor to include:</p>
                        <p>a. High cover for <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> strikes as
                            requested by the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>. (Initially four
                            targets.)</p>
                        <p>b. US air strikes on targets beyond the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> capability to handle. (Initially Nape bridge.)</p>
                        <p>c. US flak suppression for <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> strikes
                            as required. (Initially Tchepone barracks, Tchepone military area, Ban
                            Thay military area.)</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> and air defense operations as may
                            be required.</p>
                        <p>7. The Joint Chiefs of Staff further recommend that no attempt be made to
                            persuade the Lao not to strike <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss>
                            targets in Laos even though close to the North Vietnam border.</p>

                        <p>1. The corridor interdiction program of airstrikes by the Royal Laotian
                            Air Force (<gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>) began on 14 October
                            1964. From a list of 22 targets recommended by US Air Attaché (<gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss>) the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> chose 13 that were believed to be best suited to
                            airstrikes by T–28s. Of these targets, 12 were scheduled for strikes the
                            first 8 days. The <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> requested that
                            US jet cover be provided for four targets on the list of thirteen.
                            Authority was granted for use of US air cover “as necessary” but there
                            has been no indication of its use to date. <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> estimates that the initial strikes will end on the
                            23rd and harassment raids may continue for 30 days. Regarding the rest
                            of the 22 targets, <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> requested US
                            Air hit 4 “high risk” targets, 3 bridges were placed in an “on call”
                            status, and 2 targets were dropped.</p>
                        <p>2. Original planning by <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> called for
                            an average of 18 sorties against up to two targets per day. As many as
                            19 sorties have been flown against a single target as was the case with
                            the strike of the military strong-point near Lak Sao on 15 October.</p>
                        <p>3. The missions have so far been conducted out of Savannakhet using 13
                            aircraft (T–28). To date strikes are known to have been conducted
                            against 5 of the 12 scheduled targets. Yesterday, Gen <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>, Air Force Chief, moved six T–28s to
                            Pakse to strike the two southernmost targets today.</p>
                        <p>4. Lao pilot reports of strike results are sketchy and somewhat overly
                            optimistic. Although no bomb damage assessments have been completed,
                            they are programmed. An initial photo interpretation report of one of
                            the targets hit on the 14th indicated bomb craters 150–200 feet from the
                            main installation but no significant damage. Reconnaissance flights are
                            being hampered in some cases by weather. No photography of these strikes
                            is yet available in Washington.</p>

                            <item>Possible Pathet Lao/Viet Minh Moves in Laos (U)</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have noted the apprehensions and convictions
                            of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                            of Laos concerning a major Pathet Lao/Viet Minh (<gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss>) military offensive in Laos,
                            possibly as early as October, as reported by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>. They have also noted the belief
                            of the US Intelligence Board that the communists will react to recent
                            Government successes and to the failure of <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> to gain
                            concessions from Souvanna in the recent Paris talks.</p>
                        <p>2. Historically, the communists have made their moves during the dry
                            season, which commences mid to late October. Also, in the past, the
                            communists have responded to Forces Armees du Royaume (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>) gains by strong military actions. In
                            this connection, the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>, with VM military
                            assistance, are still given the capability of overrunning Laos almost at
                            will.</p>
                        <p>3. Germane to this matter are the frequent expressions of US support for
                            Souvanna; it was at our urging that he stood firmly during the Paris
                            talks and made no concessions to <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that
                            Souvanna should be assured of US military support, should the <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> launch a new offensive as he fears.
                            This support should be at the request of Souvanna and in the form
                            of:</p>
                        <p>a. Interdicting the supply routes from North Vietnam into Laos, primarily
                            Routes 6, 7, 8, and 12.</p>
                        <p>b. Prompt US air strikes against <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss>
                            forces, utilizing optimum conventional ordnance, to the extent that, in
                            conjunction with the Royal Lao Air Force, the Laotian ground forces can
                            withstand successfully the <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss>
                            attack. Aircraft used should be those US aircraft based in Thailand,
                            RVN, and at sea on the CVA(s) in the South China Sea.</p>
                        <p>4. Prompt US air strikes in response to communist aggression would not
                            only significantly assist the Lao in resisting such actions, but also
                            would convey to others, friend and enemy alike, that the United States
                            is ready and willing to assist those who are on the front line of the
                            fight against communist aggression.</p>
                        <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0321"/>
                        <p>5. In the event the <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> persist in
                            their aggression in Laos, additional measures should be taken as
                            required and as recommended to you in paragraphs 6 and 7b of JCSM–565–64
                            (extracted in the Appendix hereto).<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2">
                                <ref target="#d103">Document 103</ref>. The appendix is attached,
                                but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>6. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that governmental
                            approval in principle be sought for prompt US air strikes against
                            communist <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s in Laos and against
                            attacking <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> forces in Laos, should
                            a major <gloss target="#t_PLVM1">PL/VM</gloss> offensive be initiated
                            and should Laotian forces be unable to withstand the attack. Such
                            approval should include authority to use Thai-based US aircraft.</p>

                        <p>412. Secretary called in <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> this morning for
                            half hour talk on Laos. Secretary said he felt it timely in view Chou
                            En- Lai's presence Moscow, to discuss Laos with Ambassador as US wishes
                            see this problem solved and removed from agenda. Sole basis for solution
                            is complete and meticulous observation 1962 accords with all foreign
                            interference removed as originally agreed. Question of conference,
                            however, has been complicated by Hanoi and Peiping retreat from 1962
                            agreement. Two points of <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>'s conditions for conference <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0322"/>are especially important. Re Souvanna
                            Phouma's position at conference, he was <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s candidate whom US had accepted, who wanted genuinely
                            neutral and independent Laos, and it not possible for him to go to new
                            conference as less than Prime Minister. If Souvanna could speak only
                            when three factions agree then Laos would have no voice at conference.
                            Re <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, denial of access to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> territory is problem of fundamental
                            importance, simple to eliminate. If these two obstacles not overcome,
                            conference could not be successful and US sees no way of entering upon
                            it. US has no interest in Laos other than full compliance with 1962
                            accords, this our sole purpose which US ready support completely.
                            Observance these accords in both US and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> interests, Laos should be no cause for differences
                            between us, and solution of problem calls for urgent attention as future
                            not bright if compliance with 1962 accords is not achieved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if US agrees to
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said US never rejected conference in principle, has not
                            consulted with other governments and wished to start with <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by stressing importance of two points
                            (1) <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s position
                            and (2) <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> access.</p>
                        <p>Re (1) <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said basic
                            principle underlying 1962 accords was unanimity of three Laos factions.
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has presumed from beginning
                            this principle accepted, otherwise no united Laos could exist. This
                            basic presumption might be said to apply both de jure and de facto, and
                            is subject for conference discussion and resolution. Same applies <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> access—that is what conference is
                            for.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said if unanimity principle denies <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> access and destroys <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            then 1962 accords are violated. US would understand occasional “not this
                            time” denial but “not any time” refusal as at present would mean
                            entering upon conference as though 1962 accords nonexistent. Starting
                            point of any new conference on Laos should be the agreements achieved at
                            the 1962 conference, particularly on such matters as <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> as Prime Minister of a
                            neutral, independent nation and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> as
                            effective observer of compliance. Conference could not succeed if it
                            started as though 1962 agreement had never occurred.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stated <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has no bases, technicians, officers
                            or soldiers (except Embassy staff) in Laos, but information re US
                            presence well known.</p>
                        <p>Secretary explained US would have no objection to this as subject for
                            conference, US had withdrawn 600 men from Laos in 1962 but NVN force in
                            Laos has never fallen below 6,000 despite <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> observation some token border crossing, which maybe
                            reversed next day. Question of US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            French, or Thai, activity Laos might be considered for conference topic.
                            US sees no profit however in conference at which Peiping or Hanoi <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0323"/>could seek concessions in
                            exchange for acceptance of Souvanna as Prime Minister. One does not buy
                            same horse twice.</p>
                        <p>In response <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> query what US
                            proposes as further steps, Secretary stated if two problem points worked

                            conference.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said he would report to

                            sounded somewhat like preconditions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary responded that it is Hanoi and Pathet Lao which have initiated
                            challenge of Souvanna as Prime Minister and that problem with unanimity
                            principle is that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> unlikely at

                            Secretary said US has not raised these particular points with CPR in
                            Warsaw talks, although <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> generally
                            discussed.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> asked if Secretary could
                            give him any views on question of conference on Cambodia, which might
                            provide great power guarantees of security and independence, solve
                            Cambodian border issues, resolve difficult relations with <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, and render <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> less turbulent.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said US not yet prepared give views, will continue study idea
                            of conference. Cambodian border disputes, however, more easily solved
                            bilaterally than in conference, and <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> might better start by settling his problems
                            with Thais and <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> would
                            tell press, if asked, that Secretary had raised question of Laos. No

                        <p>On May 24, reacting to various demands for a new Geneva conference on
                            Laos, <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> spelled out
                            the conditions under which he could accept a new conference. These were
                            (1) a cease-fire “throughout the Laotian territory” and (2) withdrawal
                            of the Pathet Lao forces from positions which they had taken in the
                            Plaine des Jarres. The second of these conditions was subsequently
                            modified to call for a tripartite administration of the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> under <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> supervision. Souvanna from the first also laid great
                            stress on strengthening the position of the <gloss target="#t_GNU1">GNU</gloss> and especially that of the Prime Minister. One of the
                            main ways in which Souvanna wanted the Prime Minister's position
                            strengthened was to give him clear authority to call on the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> “for the control and the correct and
                            sincere execution of the Accords.”</p>
                        <p> Souvanna has held to these preconditions ever since May, including
                            during talks in Paris with <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> in the course of which he was subjected to
                            extreme French pressure. Throughout this period the US has consistently
                            urged Souvanna to maintain his preconditions and, more important, the
                            preconditions have come to be regarded in Laos as symbols of Souvanna's
                            firmness in resisting Communist and French pressure.</p>
                        <p>Looked at without regard for neighboring countries, political and
                            military conditions in Laos today are more favorable from our standpoint
                            than they have been for many months. In my recent visit to Laos I was
                            struck by the air of well-being and relative optimism which seemed to
                            pervade the place—an attitude quite in keeping with the Lao Ambassador's
                            remark to <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> in Moscow the
                            other day (Moscow's 1444).<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">Dated November 9.
                                (Ibid., Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> This derives from the
                            undoubted improvement in the military situation following the success of
                            Operation Triangle and the proof-testing of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>. This situation could be reversed by a renewed <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> offensive, but I think it would be wrong
                            to assume that such an offensive will necessarily materialize in the
                            next few months, or succeed if it does. On the political side, the
                            situation is also manifestly improved, with Souvanna and the neutralists
                            on our side and collaborating with the conservatives. There are, of
                            course, many things still wrong in Laos, including Communist control of
                            large areas of the country, but I think it is fair to say that our side
                            is “one up” for the first time in a long while and that, so far as Laos
                            alone is concerned, the pressure for a new move is not on us but on the
                            Communists. There is no showing that the Communists are prepared to make
                            any concessions in terms of territory or in terms of strengthening the
                            position of the <gloss target="#t_GNU1">GNU</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, or otherwise cooperating with the
                            non-Communists. Until there is some sign of movement on the Communist
                                <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0325"/>side, there is no
                            particular incentive for the non-Communists to go to a conference.
                            Contact between the factions continues in Paris so that a conference is
                            not required for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>It might, of course, be considered that a Geneva conference on Laos would
                            provide a convenient device for sounding out Communist (Peking and
                            Hanoi) views on a Vietnamese settlement. A new conference could indeed
                            do this. However, in almost every other way, it would appear to conflict
                            with our likely courses of action over the next few months. In the first
                            place, as matters stand a conference could only be brought about by
                            Souvanna's abandoning one or more of his preconditions—very probably the
                            vital ones relating to his own position and the operation of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. Given the way these conditions were
                            developed and the significance, real and symbolic, which they have taken
                            on, this would run the gravest risk of Souvanna's overthrow by rightist
                            elements in Vientiane. Even if a conference could be convened without
                            losing Souvanna in the process, it would still almost inevitably involve
                            a cease-fire. This would greatly inhibit or prevent the kind of
                            operations in the Laos corridor that are envisaged for the next few
                            months, while in no way putting similar brakes on Viet Cong use of the
                            corridor.</p>
                        <p>Finally, indicating US willingness to attend a conference on Laos under
                            foreseeable conditions would certainly detract greatly from the ominous
                            image which we wish to present during this period.</p>
                        <p>In sum, setting up a new Laos conference as a way of establishing a
                            channel of communications with Hanoi and Peking seems to me a long run
                            for a short slide. If a conference is the desired vehicle, I believe one
                            on Cambodia is a better bet, although it, too, presents grave
                            difficulties notably in terms of Thai and Vietnamese attitudes.</p>

                            of discussion among representatives of Embassies Bangkok, Saigon and
                            Vientiane. The latter two have submitted preliminary comments.</p>
                        <p>Our general conclusions at this stage are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Because of its location, Route 9 should be considered as a possible
                            element in any measures to block, limit or detect infiltration into
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. This route should logically be improved eventually in the course of
                            the long range peace-time development of the region as a component of a
                            regional highway system, as an adjunct to a Mekong Valley development
                            program and as an access to land-locked Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. Route 9 runs through territory held by the Pathet Lao and used by
                            North Vietnam in support of its campaign in the south. These facts make
                            it difficult to conceive of circumstances in which control or access to
                            critical portions would be yielded to any non-communist authorities for
                            any purpose without a struggle which would require introduction of
                            foreign troops.</p>
                        <p>4. Introduction of foreign military forces is prohibited by the 1962
                            Geneva Agreement without exception. Therefore, any operations in the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-held portion of the road would
                            entail either a basic United States policy change to permit open
                            violation of the Agreement, or elaborate diplomatic preparation to
                            reconcile the action with the Agreement and establish an acceptable
                            non-military rationale.</p>
                        <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0327"/>
                        <p>5. The problems involved in any Route 9 activity are such that further
                            consideration should be related to and subordinated to decisions on
                            basic courses of action in South Vietnam and Laos.</p>
                        <p>We can bring our present thinking on this concept into better focus if we
                            organize it around various alternative assumptions as to possible future
                            policy, of which there are three which seem most relevant to any actions
                            we might decide to undertake in the corridor. First, we may determine
                            that, in connection with continuing the pacification struggle in South
                            Vietnam, it is essential that infiltration through Laos be checked at
                            once. Second, we may decide that immediate action against the
                            infiltration routes is unnecessary, or that the costs (including effects
                            on our Lao policy) are too high, but that achievement of our Vietnam
                            objectives requires eventual curtailment of corridor infiltration.
                            Finally, we may wish at some time to seek a political settlement in
                            South Vietnam involving controls to assure against renewal of North
                            Vietnam aggression through Laos.</p>
                        <p>Under the first assumption we would probably have to think exclusively in
                            terms of military actions justified on the actual grounds of military
                            necessity and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> violations of the 1962
                            Geneva Accords. This course would require deliberate abandonment of our
                            present policy of supporting the Geneva Accords. Time would probably not
                            permit development of a plausible economic development rationale or
                            other arrangements to gain international acceptance. Furthermore, the
                            scale of military force required to meet predictably heavy <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and North Vietnam resistance would
                            quickly break down any non-military cover. It would then be a purely
                            military decision as to whether Route 9 offered the most effective basis
                            for our action in the corridor.</p>
                        <p>Under the second assumption, a longer range action program could be
                            considered. We might think in terms of a phased operation beginning with
                            efforts to create an appropriate international political atmosphere,
                            probably using various economic development arguments. The initial phase
                            might also include improving portions of the road in Vietnam and Laos
                            which are now in non-communist hands (i.e., in Laos between Savannakhet
                            and Muong Phalane). The second phase could include clearing and
                            improving the PL-held portion of the road using limited force, initially
                            Lao only, for protection of construction workers. After completion of
                            the road, which might take two years of actual construction at a cost in
                            the neighborhood of $275 million (Embassy Saigon estimate), a permanent
                            guard force might be established. This could be either a force strong
                            enough to completely block north/south movement, or a light, mobile
                            police-type force having the limited objective of acting as a “burglar
                            alarm” against DRV aggression. Under the latter approach, the ultimate
                            sanction in defense against such aggression would have to be directed
                            against the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> itself.</p>
                        <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0328"/>
                        <p>The difficulties to be encountered in planning such a long-range course
                            of action would be enormous, possibly insurmountable. The basic obstacle
                            would be the unwillingness of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and
                            North Vietnamese under any pretext to surrender, without massive
                            resistance, control of this important strategic area that they now hold
                            and use. Therefore, whatever advance preparations we might make to
                            create international acceptance of the highway project as a pretext, we
                            would probably still have to face ultimately the necessity of
                            introducing foreign military forces in defiance of the Geneva Agreements
                            and in contravention of our own present policy in Laos. It would be
                            folly to commence any long-term program relating to Route 9 without
                            appreciation of this fact.</p>
                        <p>Further, a logical objection may be raised to a long-term approach such
                            as that outlined above on the ground that, if corridor infiltration is
                            of sufficient importance to justify elaborate international arrangements
                            and heavy financial commitments, both for the road and for the related
                            economic development projects, then it must be important enough to
                            justify a course of action with more immediate effect on infiltration.
                            This point would be particularly telling if, as we believe, we would be
                            likely even at the end of our long term program to have to introduce
                            substantial military force.</p>
                        <p>Although consideration of Route 9 has up to now been related only to the
                            pacification struggle in South Vietnam, we should not exclude the
                            possibility that the general concept might be applied under the third of
                            our suggested policy assumptions (i.e., a negotiated settlement in South
                            Vietnam). In such a settlement, we might seek some kind of
                            internationally guaranteed status for South Vietnam with arrangements
                            for preventing and detecting subsequent <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration. In the enforcement arrangements, a place
                            might well be found for Route 9. As an established “beat” for patrolling
                            by the supervisory agency, it could greatly facilitate detection of
                            infiltration on both sides of the border in the critical region of the
                            demarcation line. Improvements in the road necessary for peace-keeping
                            purposes could, of course, be related also to other considerations such
                            as Mekong development, regional highway planning, etc.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>In light of the above it does not seem to us that we can fruitfully
                            proceed further in studying the Route 9 concept until basic decisions
                            have been made on our Viet-Nam policy and until we can see more clearly
                            the nature of our requirements in the Laos corridor. However, the
                            various possible formulations of the concept should be kept in mind as
                            alternatives to be explored in detail after such decisions have been
                            made. We will in the meanwhile forward the views expressed in this

                                    December 17. This conversation took place at the Beverly Hotel
                                    in New York City. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> was

                                    III. Part I dealt with the military situation in Laos. In
                                    response to a question about recent Pathet Lao advances from
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> answered that they could
                                    prove critical. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                                    also praised the use of T–28 support and thought that it had

                                    conversation, December 3; ibid., POL LAOS) Part II was a
                                    discussion of Chinese representation in the United Nations. Part
                                    IV was a request for Phoumi to met with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> promised to see if it was

                        <p>Turning to the question of Geneva accords, General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said that it is now evident that
                            the Pathet Lao has no intention of living up to them. He said that
                            Laotian public opinion would not long tolerate a passive attitude by the
                            government. If these violations continue, the government would be in a
                            most difficult situation, one which would not fit into a framework of
                            friendship with Peiping. General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said he would like to examine the matter with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and other “high
                            personalities” of the U.S. Government because so much depends upon the
                            attitude of the United States toward this matter. He said “we see quite
                            clearly that in seeking peace in Laos we can no longer count upon the
                            good will of Peiping, the Pathet Lao and Hanoi.” General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0330"/>that a change would show Laos was “entering a new
                            framework”, and he said he wanted to ask quite candidly whether “we
                            should continue to follow the present line toward Peiping and
                            Hanoi.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was important to insist upon complete and
                            meticulous compliance with the 1962 Geneva accords. He noted that the
                            North Vietnamese have violated these accords in a number of ways; he had
                            in mind the presence of North Vietnamese troops in Laos and the use of
                            Laotian territory for purposes of infiltration to South Viet-Nam. He
                            said he was convinced that if Peiping and Hanoi would leave Laos alone,
                            the Laotians would be able to decide their own future, for themselves
                            and to their satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had recently sent a message to <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> concerning Soviet
                            intentions in Laos.<note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">Text transmitted in
                                telegram 489 to Vientiane, December 1. (Ibid., Central Files, POL 27
                                LAOS)</note> He said that in conversations with Foreign Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> here in New York he
                            had pressed for full Soviet support of the 1962 accords. The Secretary
                            noted that the attitude of the Soviets toward the Geneva accords is a
                            matter of considerable importance to us since we would regard their
                            performance on them as an indication of the attitude Moscow would take
                            toward a series of other accords it is interested in concluding with the
                            United States. The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had suggested that the outcome of new talks
                            among the three Laotian factions be awaited. The Secretary felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> wanted to leave the
                            impression that the Pathet Lao might take a different tack in these
                            talks; we should try to find out if the Pathet Lao are prepared to move
                            seriously toward implementation of the accords. If this does not occur,
                            he said, we face a serious situation in Southeast Asia—one requiring
                            grave decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was deeply concerned about the unity of countries
                            under pressure from their northern neighbors. He hoped that the Laotians
                            would use what influence they had among the Vietnamese to urge them to
                            achieve internal political unity. He described the importance of such
                            unity in the terms of rallying popular American support for the effort
                            we are making in South Vietnam. He said that if the disunity now found
                            in South Viet-Nam should occur in Laos, this would have a very bad
                            effect. If, however, there were political solidarity in South Viet-Nam
                            and in Laos, an American commitment might be called very necessary and
                            successful. The Secretary mentioned that we have been “sending
                            additional signals to Hanoi” in an effort to deter the North Vietnamese
                            from some of their present activities in Laos. He said that some of the
                            accusations made by North Vietnamese are false, but not all are false.
                            Returning to the problem of domestic political unity in South Viet-Nam,
                                <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0331"/>he again stressed that the
                            international impression of unity as well as the fact of unity is
                            important.</p>
                        <p>In response General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said
                            that he would like to begin with the last part of the Secretary's
                            statement. He said that unity in Vientiane is increasing. Of course, he
                            said, it must be understood that there is no hope of unity with the
                            Pathet Lao, despite any assurance that <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> may give <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>, however, [they] have drawn much closer together
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> now sees
                            through the Communists' schemes. He said that it was quite clear that
                            Peiping and Hanoi wish to destroy the 1962 Geneva accords. <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> also feels this way,
                            and it is for this reason that he has thought of presenting the question
                            to the United Nations. This also explained his desire to request
                            additional American measures in Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would be in touch with the Laotians in another
                            ten or fifteen days after talks in Saigon have been completed. Hanoi and
                            Peiping look upon South Viet-Nam as the main theater of action. If they
                            should succeed there, Laos would be at their mercy. We must insist that
                            Hanoi and Peiping change their attitude toward their neighbors and in
                            this respect Laos is a thermometer of their intentions. Peiping could
                            change its policies in Laos with a minimum loss of face since it could
                            fall back on the 1962 Geneva accords. It is, therefore, important that
                            we continue to insist upon the full compliance of Peiping with those
                            accords. From a military point of view, Viet-Nam is the major problem,
                            but from a political point of view Laos is very sensitive. General
                            Phoumi said that he appreciated these considerations, but he said that
                            Laos could carry on as it now is indefinitely; to do so might bring on
                            serious changes. He said that it is clear that Hanoi and Peiping have a
                            very negative attitude. The Secretary said that this is also our present
                            estimate, stressing the word “present.” General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said that the present military
                            situation in Laos is indicative of a desire on the part of the Pathet
                            Lao and South Viet-Nam to advance rather than to retreat. He said that
                            he hoped we were prepared to cope with the situation should eventual
                            developments confirm these indications. The Secretary assured him that
                            we would be watching the situation very closely.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> said that there were
                            a couple of other matters he wanted to discuss. Since the Government of
                            National Union had been established, there had a break in liaison
                            between the Laotian and the U.S. military at both the national level and
                            at lower command levels. The Secretary said that he believed contact was
                            now being maintained through the Embassy at Vientiane, and he said that
                            he believed this was an adequate channel. In this connection the
                            Secretary said he wanted to mention that our new Ambassador to Laos, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, was the personal
                                <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0332"/>choice of the Secretary and
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">In an October 19 memorandum to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, Dungan stated that

                                appointment of <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> as
                                Ambassador to Laos. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                                was then a Special Assistant to <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName> in Saigon and had been involved in Southeast

                                been on the firing line in Vientiane for several years.”

                        <p>The Secretary recalled his brief private conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the other day<note n="2" xml:id="d147fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recounted this December 1
                                discussion in <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note> on the
                            subject of Laos and said he wanted to make a <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0333"/>few further comments. In the course of that
                            conversation, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had
                            indicated that we should await the discussions among the three Laotian
                            factions and see how they proceeded. We now gathered that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> had sent a message to
                                <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Souvannavong</persName> suggesting
                            discussions, but we had no information as to the latter's reaction. The
                            Secretary wondered whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> knew anything about <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Souvannavong</persName>'s reaction and also what his own estimate
                            was of the prospects for such discussions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied he had no
                            information.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed the hope that the three factions would be able to
                            establish effective contact and that progress towards the full
                            implementation of the 1962 Geneva accords would be made. Our position,
                            which we had repeated on numerous occasions, was that all those involved
                            in Laos, and particularly the signatories of the Geneva accords, should
                            strictly comply with those accords. Perhaps the first move in that
                            direction could be discussion among the three factions, which we hoped
                            would bring concrete results.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that Soviet Union
                            had always welcomed discussion of internal questions between the three
                            Laotian parties. Unfortunately, the other side, i.e., the rightists led
                            by <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi Nosavan</persName>, and in part
                            also Souvanna, did not want to cooperate with the third party. One
                            recent example of this was the designation of the Laotian delegation to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, which had been made without
                            agreement among the three, who had different positions on this matter.
                            The Soviet Union believed that the rightists were to blame for the
                            situation in Laos. This was the Soviet appraisal of the situation, an
                            appraisal which the Soviet Union had always regarded to be correct and
                            which it continued to maintain. As far as the U.S. was concerned, the
                            Soviet Government had believed and continued to believe that it would be
                            best if the U.S. withdrew from Laos all of its forces, both military and
                            para-military, and particularly the air force now stationed in that
                            country. Such an action would be in the interests of both the U.S. and
                            the U.S.S.R. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            continued that there was no need for convincing the Soviet Union of the
                            necessity of implementing the 1962 accords. As he had told the Secretary
                            both in Geneva and in New York, the Soviet Union considered that the
                            accords should be fully implemented, and this remained Soviet policy. He
                            said he was glad to hear from the Secretary that he was of the same
                            opinion, but wished to point out that there should be no discrepancy
                            between U.S. words and deeds.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to state very clearly, without any
                            possibility of misunderstanding, that there was no problem regarding the
                            so-called U.S. military personnel in Laos; if many thousands of North
                            Vietnamese military personnel left Laos and went home, there would be no
                            U.S. personnel in Laos. We had withdrawn our personnel in 1962, but <pb n="302" xml:id="pg_302" facs="0334"/>Hanoi had not; indeed, it had
                            introduced many thousands of additional personnel in the last few
                            months. The roads from Hanoi into eastern Laos were jammed with trucks
                            carrying arms, personnel, and possibly some peaceful goods as well. The
                            Secretary said he wished to stress that the following three factors were
                            the chief obstacle to the implementation of the 1962 accords: First,
                            there was continued presence, and in increasing numbers, of North
                            Vietnamese personnel in Laos, something which was contrary to the
                            agreement. Second, in contravention of the agreement, there was
                            continued and increasing use of Laotian territory for infiltrating into
                            Laos and South Vietnam. Finally, the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            was not allowed to carry out its activities in the territory controlled
                            by Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese elements. All these were flagrant
                            violations of the Geneva accords. Our policy continued to be one of
                            seeking full implementation of the 1962 accords, and if Pathet Lao and
                            North Vietnam were to accept such implementation, there would be no
                            difficulty on the part of the U.S. or of the elements with which we have
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that regarding
                            North Vietnamese military personnel, he could only repeat what he had
                            told the Secretary a few days ago, but he did not see any point in doing
                            so. The only observation he could add was that if the Secretary's
                            information were correct, all of Laos would have been overrun by now.
                            Yet this was not the case and no one had been able to produce any
                            concrete evidence of North Vietnamese presence in Laos. He suggested
                            that we await the forthcoming discussions among the three factions in
                            Paris and expressed the hope that they would be successful. He said the
                            Soviet Union was not happy with the situation in Laos since it was not
                            as it should be under the terms of the Geneva accords. The U.S. was
                            informed of the Soviet views regarding the reasons for that situation.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> then said that he had
                            exhausted the comments he could make on this subject. Noting that there
                            had been no prearranged agenda for this meeting, he said there were
                            other topics he would like to raise.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary had no objection to moving to other subjects. He agreed
                            that we should sound out the situation from the forthcoming talks among
                            the three factions. He thought there was broad agreement between the two
                            sides on basic policy. However, he also believed that it would also be
                            useful if from time to time the two sides were to exchange information
                            regarding the factual situation in Laos, inasmuch as sometimes small
                            noises in Laos made big headlines in the papers, creating the impression
                            of a big war going on there.</p>

                        <p>In a December 7, 1965, memorandum to Secretaries of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Director of Central
                            Intelligence <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName>, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> informed them that he
                            had approved “a paper on policy toward Southeast Asia as guidance for
                            the work in this field for the coming months.” The paper, prepared by
                            the Executive Committee of the National Security Council on December 2,
                            considered Southeast Asia with special reference to South Vietnam, but
                            it also contained specific references to Laos. In the initial “Concept”
                            section of the paper, the third objective was to “maintain the security
                            of other [than South Vietnam] non-Communist nations in Southeast Asia
                            including specifically the maintenance and observance of the Geneva
                            Accords of 1962 in Laos.” In that same section, the paper stated that
                            the action program against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam would
                            include as its first phase over the next 30 days: “intensified forms of
                            action already under way, plus possibly US air protection of Lao
                            aircraft making strikes in the Corridor, US armed reconnaissance and air
                            strikes against infiltration routes in Laos.”</p>
                        <p>In describing the Thirty Day Action Program as it affected Laos and
                            Thailand, the paper stated that, “in the case of Laos, we will obtain
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> approval of an intensified
                            program of US armed reconnaissance and air strikes both in the Panhandle
                            area and along key infiltration routes in central Laos. These actions
                            will not be publicized except to the degree approved by the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>.” The paper added that Thailand “will
                            be asked to support our program fully, to intensify its own efforts in
                            the north and northeast, and to give further support to operations in
                            Laos, such as additional pilots and possibly artillery teams.” In
                            describing “Intensified Military Actions,” the paper noted that “Lao
                            military operations will be intensified, especially in the corridor
                            areas and close to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> border. US
                            air cover and flak suppression may be supplied where needed.” Also
                            included under this heading was the statement that “US armed
                            reconnaissance and airstrikes will be carried out in Laos, first against
                            the corridor area and within a short time against Route 7 and other
                            infiltration routes. (These actions will be subject to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> concurrence and publicized only to the
                            degree agreed with Souvanna.)” Finally the paper listed deferred actions
                            not to be taken within the 30-day period, but to be considered for
                            adoption in the transitional phase of the program. One of these actions
                            was “<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>/Lao air strikes across the
                            border [of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>], initially against
                            infiltration routes and installations and then against targets south of
                            the 19th parallel.” (Both Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos

                                <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1964–1968, volume I</ref>,
                            pages 990–992.]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that on this point it was best to start with Laos,
                            since there was a recent accord in existence with respect to that
                            country. If a Fourteen-Nation meeting were convened which was doomed to
                            failure, that would worsen the situation, just as a deteriorating
                            situation in the country lessened the prospects for success of the
                            meeting. Our view was that if Souvanna Phoumi had left the 1962
                            conference as Prime Minister, he should not be asked to come to the
                            conference now as something else, e.g., as Chairman of three factions
                            unable to speak without agreement among the three. It was the Soviet
                            Union who had supported Souvanna in 1962. We had accepted him and we
                            believed he should return to the conference as Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that another problem was that for two years the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> had not been permitted to carry
                            out its activities on the part of Laos under Pathet Lao's control,
                            except to go to Kang Khai and ask <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Souvannavong</persName> what his wishes were. That was a flagrant
                            violation of the 1962 accords. We would be willing to go to the
                            conference if those who came there felt bound by the 1962 accords and
                            did not start all over again, as if no agreement had ever been reached.
                            In other words, the question was the attitude of Hanoi. Were they going
                            to leave their neighbors alone? If not, we had a serious problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said he didn't like
                            the Secretary's remarks. The Secretary appeared to be against holding a
                            conference on Vietnam or Laos; at least he was advancing preliminary
                            conditions for such conferences. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>
                            <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0337"/>said he did not believe that
                            this was in the interest of the U.S. The U.S. seemed to want to expand
                            the war. Of course, he recognized that the Secretary had his own views,
                            but if the U.S. wanted to improve the situation, he did not see how it
                            could object to holding conferences on Vietnam and Laos. He did not
                            think the Secretary's negative position was justified. In any event, the
                            U.S. could state to the conference the views the Secretary had just set
                            forth to him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, as Co-Chairman, would make it clear in inviting
                            Laos that he was inviting <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> as Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> replied that the
                            question of form was of secondary importance and that it could be
                            resolved once there was agreement to hold a meeting. The Secretary
                            should reply whether the U.S. was willing to have a conference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we wanted to know what we were attending. We wanted to
                            know who would represent Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was not a
                            serious problem, and perhaps the three factions would reach agreement on
                            this point. In any event, those who objected to conferences did not look
                            very good.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that we had thought this problem could be gotten
                            around through the Polish proposal. However, Hanoi and Peiping had said
                            no and that was the end of it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that in any event the meeting as proposed
                            by Poland would have been only preparatory.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that he was rather sensitive as to who represented
                            Laos, because when he had arrived at the last conference, there had been
                            an understanding between the two Co-Chairmen which had not been
                            communicated to him. He then asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had heard anything about
                                <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Souvannavong</persName>'s reply to
                            Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had no information on
                            this point. He said he wished to note that now the U.S. had two princes
                            under its influence. Indeed the Laotian capital was surrounded by
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s troops and even
                            neutral troops were absent from Vientiane. Moreover, after Pholsena's
                            assassination, neutrals were afraid to come to Vientiane and were
                            concerned about their safety.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed there had been rumors that Pholsena had been
                            involved in the assassinations of some neutral leaders. [Here follows

                        <p>868. I met alone with Souvanna this afternoon and carried out full sense
                            of my instructions.<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2">Not further
                                identified.</note> Souvanna's reaction was excellent and he is
                            prepared cooperate in full measure with our proposals. As anticipated
                            the only complication arose in my request for his concurrence in the
                            introduction of more candor into our public statements concerning air
                            operations in Laos.</p>
                        <p>He fully supports the US program of pressures against North Vietnam and
                            believes they should be carried out with deliberate “sang-froid”. He
                            reviewed his familiar contention that actions speak louder than words
                            and believes we should in this instance let the actions speak for
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>In discussing proposed armed reconnaissance against infiltration routes
                            he specifically requested that we employ US aircraft over Routes 7, 8
                            and 12. He demonstrated full comprehension of meaning of “armed
                            reconnaissance” by stipulating that if we “see anything moving on the
                            road, either day or night, attack it.” He asked that our air attaché
                            coordinate the proposed US actions with General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and assured me full cooperation of
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>With respect contemplated air strike against Ban Ken Bridge, he
                            recognized significance this action and did not blanch when I told him
                            it might involve a considerable number of aircraft. He himself expressed
                            hope we would eliminate anti-aircraft batteries before attacking bridge
                            structure. It was in discussion of this particular action and the real
                            possibility that we might lose some aircraft in the process that I
                            stressed need for more frank admission by US authorities concerning
                            nature of actions in which our aircraft would be engaged. On this point
                            Souvanna became quite adamant. He cited North Vietnamese attitude of
                            bland, unembarrassed denial of military presence in Laos even when four
                            of their soldiers have been captured and presented to the public. He
                            said that open admission by the US of military action on Laotian soil in
                            direct violation of 1962 agreements would not only open us to extensive
                            Communist propaganda attack but would face him with intolerable
                            international and domestic pressures. He proposed that we stick to line
                            that US aircraft <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0339"/>conducting
                            photographic reconnaissance at <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            request and that, if unhappily one should be shot down, we leave the
                            impression it was consequence of reconnaissance mission. He even
                            recommended we refuse to acknowledge that aircraft were armed.</p>
                        <p>I explained to him necessity for candor in maintaining US public support
                            for Southeast Asian policy and desire US officials maintain public
                            confidence by avoiding misleading statements. I said I was not sure his
                            response would constitute satisfactory formula for Washington but would
                            report his views faithfully.</p>
                        <p>He said he was leaving tomorrow for visit with King and subsequent
                            travels Sayaboury Province. Returning Vientiane December 15. I told him
                            we might wish begin some operations prior to that date. He took that
                            fully in stride, saying “we are ready today” and only asked that I let
                            him know the results of our operations.</p>
                        <p>In making my presentation I stressed need for maximum discretion,
                            advising him that only limited number US officials and senior
                            representatives specified allies were being informed of our intentions.
                            He indicated complete understanding need for maximum security.<note n="3" xml:id="d150fn3">Also during this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> gave Souvanna an oral

                                courage and perseverance” and expressing confidence that Souvanna

                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff understand that a gradual increase in
                            intensity of operations is intended for the second week. They consider
                            that some relaxation in the existing guidance will be required in order
                            that more frequent route coverage may be obtained and a greater number
                            of aircraft may be assigned certain missions. Additionally, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff consider that towards the end of the second week
                            operations should be extended from those against corridor infiltration
                            targets to armed reconnaissance of Route 7, the main route from the DRV
                            leading into the Plaine des Jarres. Prime Minister Souvanna has
                            frequently asked that the United States interdict this route.</p>
                        <p>3. Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the following
                            missions be approved for the second week's plan of US armed
                            reconnaissance/prebriefed air strikes (Annex) in Laos:</p>

                        <p>1. The meeting opened with the approval of the attached telegram<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">A note on the source text indicates that all
                                the attachments were destroyed on January 26, 1972.</note> approving
                            four air strike missions in Laos according to the missions stated on the
                            attached map. There was some discussion of the fact that these actions
                            do not constitute an escalation of the situation in Laos, although the
                            Route 7 mission might cause some reaction. It was noted that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s problems with
                            respect to the previous missions have been taken care of.</p>
                        <p>2. It was agreed that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would
                            continue a stonewall “no comment” response to any Hanoi propaganda blast
                            as a result of the above <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0342"/>missions. If a plane were lost, however, the principals would assemble
                            for consideration of the appropriate line. Mr. Greenfield pointed out
                            that the press currently assumes that we are over Laos on a daily basis
                            and he believed that there would be little reaction even if we were to
                            announce the loss of a plane. Mr. Greenfield suggested that our major
                            problem would come from leakage of our planning and program.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> pointed out
                            that the field is being pressed on this subject. He stated that Mr.
                            Greenfield and others estimated that there would be little splash caused
                            by its release. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VCR1">Vance</persName> stated
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> still
                            prefers that it not be released. Mr. Greenfield also pointed out that it
                            might be worth stalling as its release would give Alsop and other
                            journalists a handle for pressure. It was agreed that the matter would
                            be covered by gradual reference to “increased infiltration” in
                            backgrounders and that Saigon would be authorized, if pressed by the
                            press, to give a backgrounder giving the general figures involved.</p>

                        <p>A two-week program of Barrel Roll activities was submitted. The program
                            continues in fairly low key and signals (“by design”) no intensification
                            of U.S. actions in Laos.<note n="3" xml:id="d153fn3">See <ref target="#d151">Document 151</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was agreed to continue our stone-walling tactics with respect to
                            information on these flights. We will deal with shoot-downs on a
                            case-by-case basis. (Greenfield noted that there is a great lack of
                            interest, both in this country and abroad, on U.S. planes over Laos).
                            However, we should prepare for leaks to the likes of Alsop or
                            Baldwin.</p>
                        <p>The infiltration report was shelved indefinitely,<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Regarding this report, see <ref target="frus1964-68v01#pg_1013">

                            increased infiltration should seep out gradually. If Embassy spokesmen

                            a request from Saigon, it was decided that this program had a large
                            enough bank of targets to give it the flexibility necessary.</p>

                        <p> Bill Bundy raised the question of contingency planning for the use of

                            probing of the Australian Ambassador brought a surprisingly favorable

                            his talk with the New Zealand Ambassador was somewhat discouraging.</p>

                            mentioned the concern that some of the younger military officers have

                        <p>The following actions are to be taken:</p>
                        <p>1. You are to get final approval on the two-week program for Barrel Roll

                        <head>154. Editorial Note</head>
                        <p>On January 6, 1965, Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BWP1">William Bundy</persName> sent Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> a memorandum entitled “Notes on the South
                            Vietnamese Situation and Alternatives.” The memorandum was in
                            anticipation of a meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> that afternoon at the White House. Most of
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>'s memorandum concerned Vietnam, but he
                            did discuss Laos, noting that North Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union
                            “have called for a Laos Conference without preconditions but have
                            refrained from mentioning a conference on Vietnam.”
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that the explanation was
                            simple: the three were “not too happy with the way things have gone in
                            Laos, but that they see Vietnam falling into their laps in the fairly
                            near future.” <persName>Bundy</persName> added than no one at the
                            Department of State believed that the Pathet Lao/North Vietnamese would
                            concede in any meaningful way on the preconditions demanded by Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> suggested that the Pathet Lao/North
                            Vietnamese hoped that Souvanna and the United States would abandon these
                            preconditions, thus drastically weakening, if not destroying, Souvanna's
                            position in Vientiane. With the exception of the situation in Laos,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that in the rest of Southeast
                            Asia, U.S. posture was weak, especially <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0345"/>in South Vietnam and Thailand. He suggested
                            consideration of specific actions to remedy this problem. One of these
                            actions was intensified air operations in Laos.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> noted “they may have some use, but they
                            will not meet the problem of Saigon morale and, if they continue at a
                            high level, may raise significant possibilities of Communist
                            intervention in Laos with some plausible justification.”
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> stated that the United States had “gone
                            about as far as we can go in Laos by the existing limited actions,”
                            apart from cutting Route 7, intensified military actions would not
                            accomplish much. He concluded that “this form of action thus has little
                            further to gain in the Laos context, and has no real bearing at this
                            point on the South Vietnamese context.” <persName>Bundy</persName>'s

                            Minh-Pathet Lao to dismantle and disperse installations in many target
                            areas. Presumably these installations have been re-established under
                            jungle cover. Presumably also, due to random interdiction of roads, Viet
                            Minh have moved into more expensive and less satisfactory methods of

                                from Saigon, January 8. In this telegram the Embassy stated that the
                                conferees felt it was doubtful “whether Hanoi had identified Barrel
                                Roll operations as a separate and distinct U.S. act of minor
                                escalation,” the reason being that it had been so overshadowed by
                                the far more numerous Lao Air Force T–28 and U.S. Yankee Team
                                sorties. (Ibid., POL 27 LAOS)</note> Message will also provide

                            air operations. Beyond these recommendations, however, group strongly
                            believes that certain additional Washington authority is required to
                            obtain maximum efficiency US assets committed to this program without
                            markedly increasing visibility these air actions. Essentially,
                            authorization consists of following:</p>
                        <p>A. Single pre-planned air strike against bridge at Ban Ken (UG 6066).
                            Success of this action would relieve to some degree potential pressures
                            against ground forces in northern sector of Laos, provide choke point
                            with additional targets, and create additional obstacles to rapid
                            support or reinforcement of enemy forces west of the bridge. It would
                            probably also reduce requirements for some of risky armed and photo
                            reconnaissance missions of type now flown by US aircraft along Route
                            7.</p>
                        <p>B. Because of dispersal concentrations in panhandle area and camouflage
                            targets as noted above, there is need for intensive new low level Yankee
                            Team oblique photography along Routes 12, 8, 23 and 9 in Laos corridor.
                            Airmen present at meeting were unanimous in view that such flights, if
                            flown on random schedule and with appropriate armed escort, would not
                            involve significant risk of pilot and plane loss. They were equally
                            unanimous in view that current pattern of flights which places <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0347"/>Yankee Team planes above
                            anti-aircraft range is of limited value from tactical and intelligence
                            viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>C. In contemplating future pattern “Barrel Roll” operations, group
                            recommends that configuration of missions be concentrated on two types
                            of operations: (1) night armed reconnaissance missions flown along
                            Laotian corridor routes and Route 7; (2) daytime operations with
                            priority given to “secondary targets” and armed reconnaissance feature
                            becoming subsidiary. In instance no. 1 above, ordnance load, if not
                            expended on target of opportunity, would be returned to base or
                            jettisoned into the sea. In instance no. 2 above, targets designated
                            would be those (i.e. bridges and A.A. installations, etc.) mutually
                            agreed between <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> Vientiane as more satisfactory for US

                        <p>A review of all available intelligence leads to the conclusion there has
                            been a significant reinforcement of the North Vietnamese forces in the
                            Plaine des Jarres and the Panhandle (see map).<note n="2" xml:id="d158fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> Although a
                            reinforcement of this type tends to occur each year at the end of the
                            rainy season, it has extended farther to the south than heretofore and
                            probably exceeds the totals observed in previous years.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the end of the rainy season, there were an estimated 7–8 North
                            Vietnamese battalions, and a total of 5–6,000 North Vietnamese troops
                            present in Laos. Although precise information is still lacking, it is
                            believed that the recently introduced elements may have increased the
                            number of North Vietnamese units to 14–16 battalions and overall
                            personnel strength to 9–11, 000. Pathet Lao strength has remained
                            relatively constant at some 20,000 men. This recent reinforcement,
                            although it provides improved defenses for key installations and
                            infiltration routes, also gives the Communists a capability to move
                            sharply, and with little or no warning, against targets in Laos and
                            South Vietnam should they decide on retaliation for increased pressures
                            brought to bear on them by the U.S.</p>

                        <p>The 19 January Soviet note was sent to the British in the form of a draft
                            message from the Geneva cochairman to the U.S. and the three Laotian
                                factions.<note n="3" xml:id="d158fn3">As reported in telegram 2084
                                from Moscow, January 20. (Department of State, Central Files, POL
                                27–14 LAOS)</note> It provides further evidence of Moscow's concern
                            that U.S. air strikes in Laos may call forth Pathet Lao and North
                            Vietnamese counteractions leading, in turn, to a dangerous military
                            escalation. Following previous practice, the Soviets published their
                            draft without waiting for a British response.</p>
                        <p>In addition to expressing support for the Pathet Lao's routine call on 17
                            December for a new Geneva conference, the Soviet draft urges the <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0351"/>leaders of all three Laotian
                            “political forces” to refrain from actions which would aggravate the
                            situation. This might be an oblique warning to the Pathet Lao and North
                            Vietnamese to avoid moves which might provoke greater U.S.
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>Moscow's attempts to inhibit the actions of both sides in the Laos
                            conflict may have been prompted by a belief that the North Vietnamese
                            and Chinese are developing a public justification for renewed offensive
                            action in Laos. Propaganda and official statements over the past month
                            have at least implied that Hanoi and Peiping would regard U.S. air
                            strikes against “liberated areas” in Laos as a move to “extend the war
                            to all of Indochina”.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Moscow has written to the North Vietnamese and Chinese
                            Foreign Ministers supporting their recent protests against U.S. actions
                            in “involving troops of its South Korean puppets in the aggressive war
                            against the South Vietnamese people.” <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> stated that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, “will render every support and assistance” to the
                            people of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Free World Press Reaction to Recent
                            Events</p>
                        <p>The shooting down of two American jets in Laos on January 13 was given
                            moderate press coverage in most areas of the non-Communist world,
                            accompanied by very light, scattered comments in a few countries.</p>
                        <p>A definite change in U.S. military and political policy was seen by the
                            London Times and Rome's Messaggero. The Times said this was “the first
                            official indication that the bombing of Viet Cong supply lines had
                            begun.” The Times headline over the story said “First Evidence of New
                            Policy.”</p>
                        <p>Messaggero said the action “suggests a radical change in the political
                            and military course followed until now by the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> administration.” This course, the paper
                            says, “is a serious warning to North Vietnam about U.S. determination to
                            react strongly to a move or less direct intervention of North Vietnam in
                            the war in South Vietnam.”</p>
                        <p>A sharp change in tactics was also seen by the West German press. The
                            Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung viewed the American air attacks as a
                            development of new tactics in an effort to stop Communist reinforcements
                            and supplies.</p>
                        <p> Le Monde, Paris, reviewed developments and added, “even though the State
                            Department neither confirms nor clearly denies that the air force has
                            been making photographs or conducting air attacks, it has admitted
                            implicitly that a new phase of intervention has been underway for some
                            time.”</p>
                        <p>In the Far East, reports are available only from Thai newspapers which
                            have carried official comment and editorials. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_TK1">Thanom</persName>
                            <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0352"/>approved the U.S. air action
                            and said “if supplies and reinforcements can be prevented from reaching
                            the Viet Cong, it might greatly facilitate the suppression of the
                            Communist guerrillas in South Vietnam.”</p>
                        <p>No comment has yet been received from other countries in the Far East or
                            from Africa and Latin America.</p>

                            found for reconvening international conference on settlement of Laotian
                            question. British would be agreeable have conversations take place
                            between ambassadors in Vientiane, or in London or Moscow. Unless Russian
                            response is wholly negative, matter could then be pursued during

                            mid-March.</p>
                        <p>Finally, British point out that approach along above lines need not
                            commit <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> or other Western powers to any
                            particular course of action. If Russian attitude either before or during
                            conversations seemed unpromising, it would be possible to concentrate
                            talks on future of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> or let them lapse
                            altogether.</p>
                        <p>We are informing British Embassy that we agree on desirability of probing
                            Soviet intentions further. We suggest, however, that principal thrust of
                            approach should be on question of preparing report on future of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, rather than on reconvening
                            international conference, although we recognize that it may be necessary
                            to hold out possibility of latter to interest Russians in further
                            discussions. Possibility of conference is implicit in Article 19 of
                            Geneva Protocol and we will urge British, if they feel it necessary to
                            advert to conference, to relate it to requirement under Article 19 to
                            consult with members of conference re <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> not later than July 1965. We have of course stressed
                            that in going along with proposed approach to Soviets, we are in no way
                            committed on question of US participation in new conference on Laos.
                            Decision on this would depend not only on outcome of Anglo-Russian
                            conversations but also on situation in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> and on attitudes of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            (and <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>Except for London, above should not be discussed with host governments.
                            Approach should in general be treated with greatest discretion, as any
                            indication of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> discussions on subject 14-nation conference could have

                            of past six weeks, which had brought number of aircraft available for

                        <p>The Communist troop and supply buildup in the Laotian corridor since
                            December has raised the possibility that Hanoi intends to initiate a
                            major new offensive in Laos or to introduce regular North Vietnamese
                            army units into South Vietnam. However, the relatively cautious
                            Communist propaganda approach to Laos and the absence (despite Binh

                                4, 1965, the longest battle of the war in South Vietnam to that

                            conventional warfare in South Vietnam argue against the conclusion that
                            these are now Communist intentions. The events preceding the buildup and
                            the evidence we have of its nature point more convincingly to the
                            conclusion that the buildup represents a determined effort to shore up
                            and maintain the security of the infiltration routes to South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Communist Setbacks in the Corridor. Since October, <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> T–28's and Yankee Team aircraft have
                            conducted an intensive air reconnaissance and interdiction program
                            against known and suspected infiltration-related targets. The extent of
                            damage inflicted by air operations is unknown. However, photography
                            confirms that many former military areas are now deserted and nearly all
                            road movements take place at night. Since November, <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> units—largely through superior
                            artillery and close air support—have completed Phase II of Operation
                            Victorious Arrow,<note n="3" xml:id="d161fn3">Operation Victorious Arrow
                                was a <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> operation to retake Route

                                north the previous year, U.S. aircraft did not play a major support
                                role.</note> advancing some 10 miles on a 15 mile front along Route
                            9 and capturing several former Pathet Lao strong points. In addition,
                            four to five Meo intelligence/harassment teams have infiltrated deep
                            into Communist-held territory and at least one has clashed with
                            Communist forces.</p>
                        <p>Compared with the degree of control previously exercised by the
                            Communists over this area, therefore, developments since the end of the
                            rainy season have represented a serious deterioration. The Communists
                            undoubtedly know that Phase III of Victorious Arrow envisages an <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0356"/>attempt to capture Muong Phine;
                            they may also interpret the press speculation following Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Taylor</persName>'s December visit to
                            Washington and the subsequent US jet strikes as a prelude to a ground
                            movement against access routes to South Vietnam. In any event, there is
                            ample cause for Communist concern over existing and possible future
                            deterioration of their security in the corridor.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Communist Response</hi>. Since December, road watch
                            teams have reported artillery, anti-aircraft weapons, heavy convoys and
                            a possible total of 2,000 North Vietnamese troops, moving west and south
                            in the Panhandle. Aerial photography has confirmed the arrival of
                            possibly two new anti-aircraft battalions in the same area during the
                            same period. These battalions alone, accompanied by security forces,
                            support elements, and ammunition, could account for a major portion of
                            the reported troop and supply movements. The remainder may have been
                            introduced to cope with <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/Meo ground
                            action and to provide the manpower for a sharp counter-attack against
                            operation Victorious Arrow. In December 1963, for example, the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> advance on Kham Keut and Lak Sao was
                            reversed only after an estimated 2–3,000 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
                            troops had been brought into the area.</p>
                        <p>We conclude that although recent movements make intensified anti-aircraft
                            and ground action highly likely, they do not indicate any basic change
                            in Communist tactics in Laos or in South Vietnam.</p>

                            Several roadblocks have mushroomed around city and troop movements <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0358"/>are reported. One short burst
                            of automatic weapons fire about 2015 hours.</p>
                        <p>Most rumors suggest that young colonels may be taking action that they
                            have long discussed. If so, action likely be diffused and directed
                            primarily against grievances which are more personal than
                            institutional.</p>
                        <p>We have officers with General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and Col. Ttoglith [Tong Lit?] at Chinamao. We
                            are sending others to be with General <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> at his headquarters. Our purpose is to neutralize
                            main sources of local power in order avoid escalation.</p>
                        <p>British Ambassador, who has called Souvanna, has been assured by latter
                            that situation being brought under his control but we, at current
                            moment, have no assurance that he knows any more than we do just what is
                            afoot.</p>

                        <p>Vientiane, February 1, 1965, 12:30 a.m.</p>
                        <p>1165. As far as we can determine, difficulty in Vientiane seems to be
                            initiated by Col <persName corresp="#p_BCS1">Bounleut
                                Saycocie</persName>, malcontent chief of logistics and activist
                            among Young Turks of military establishment. Our best estimate is that
                            he has only one company of troops. However, this is difficult to judge
                            with confidence since everybody with a weapon seems to be milling round
                            in town or on the outskirts.</p>
                        <p> Bounleut's principal accomplishment so far has been seizure of radio
                            station. He has broadcast five communiques announcing coup d'etat in
                            name of several officers who, to best of our knowledge, are not engaged
                            in activities. Radio station seems to have been left in hands of few
                            soldiers who control entrance while main force of Bounleut's company
                            have moved south of city in direction of Chinaimo camp.</p>
                        <p>I have rounded up Australian technician who runs radio station (he
                            unfortunately is half-stoned) and also Australian DCM. With concurrence
                            Australian Ambassador, I am sending a joint US-Australian Task Force of
                            about 6 men to cut a wire leading from radio station studios to
                            transmitters, thus putting radio off the air. They have instructions to
                            do this only if they can avoid confrontation with military.</p>
                        <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0359"/>
                        <p>Once we have silenced radio station, I hope we can send Bounleut and his
                            boy scouts back to their marshmallows.</p>
                        <p>I have talked with <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> by
                            telephone and am reasonably confident he is not personally directing
                            this operation. However, he is fairly lathering to take advantage of
                            anything that develops. Both Souvanna and General <persName corresp="#p_OR1">Ouane</persName> are in King's palace compound
                            where I have not been able to reach them by telephone. Three members of
                            Cabinet are holed up in [garble—hospital?] (where we were having dinner
                            and where my wife is now plying them with cognac to quell their
                            trepidations).</p>
                        <p>In general, it seems to be a normal Sunday evening in Vientiane.</p>

                        <p>1166. ANZUS Task Force has cut wires, putting radio off air. I have sent
                            two officers from Military Attache's office to roadblock controlled by
                            Bounleut's troops to tell them coup has failed and to advise them head
                            for the hills. To best our knowledge, only casualties are two soldiers
                            from Chinaimo who were killed while attempting run Bounleut roadblock. I
                            am off to see Souvanna at palace if I can get through.</p>

                        <p>1167. I have just come from seeing Souvanna, who is holed up in King's
                            compound with most of General Staff and with those Cabinet officers who
                            not at my house. He was delighted know we had cut radio and seems to
                            feel that effort will fizzle.</p>
                        <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0360"/>
                        <p>According his information there are two colonels involved: Bounleut
                            Saycocie and Khamchan Souvouovong. They dispose at most of two companies
                            of men. Their chances for success seem nil. He asked if we could assist
                            in disposing their men.</p>
                        <p>We sent Assistant Military Attaché to camp which Bounleut allegedly was
                            using as command post but have not been able find him. We are now
                            sending same officer to seek him out at roadblock en route Camp
                            Chinaimo.</p>
                        <p>In meantime, I am sending General Sang (PsyWar Chief) who still drinking
                            my brandy at my residence, in company with EmbOff to get message from
                            Souvanna to broadcast on his Armed Forces Radio Station. Sang seems
                            somewhat reluctant, but he is being transported bodily to palace at this
                            moment. Assuming broadcast calms population and troops disperse, I think
                            we may be out of woods by morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d162fn2">On

                            directed an intensive artillery barrage on the headquarters camp of

                        <p>To assess the significance of recent Communist military force deployments
                            in Laos, North Vietnam, and South China, and to estimate the scope and
                            timing of Communist military operations in Laos and South Vietnam over
                            the next four or five months.</p>
                        <p rend="center">The Estimate</p>
                        <p>1. The Present Situation. A gradual buildup over several years has given
                            the forces of Communist China, North Vietnam, the Pathet Lao, <pb n="331" xml:id="pg_331" facs="0363"/>and the Viet Cong potent
                            military capabilities in and near Laos and South Vietnam, including
                            offensive capabilities as yet unused and defensive capabilities as yet
                            untested. Since the Tonkin Gulf incidents of August 1964, various
                            Communist moves and force deployments have noticeably improved some of
                            these capabilities, particularly the air defense of South China and
                            North Vietnam. During the same period, deployments of Communist forces
                            in some parts of Laos have augmented capabilities already in being.
                            There has also been a steady improvement in the capabilities of Viet
                            Cong forces in South Vietnam. Some of this improvement results from
                            stepped up North Vietnamese support, though detailed judgments are
                            complicated by the spotty and frequently ambiguous nature of the
                            evidence available.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">The details of Communist
                                deployments are given in the <gloss target="#t_USIB1">USIB</gloss>

                                channels). [Footnote in the source text. The memorandum was not
                                found.]</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. We believe that these new deployments have the immediate purpose of
                            improving the military capabilities of Communist forces in those areas
                            where US and US-supported pressure against them has been increased,
                            e.g., in the Laos panhandle, where T–28 and <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> ground operations are taking place, and in the air over
                            North Vietnam, where reconnaissance is flown and where further air
                            strikes are feared. The Communists probably also hope that these
                            deployments will help deter the US from expanding the war to North
                            Vietnam. The addition of air strength to the already formidable ground
                            strength in the China/Indochina border area is also intended to
                            strengthen Chinese/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> defenses against
                            the contingency that the US might ignore Communist warnings and take the
                            war to North Vietnam and even to China.</p>
                        <p>3. The deployments we have observed do not now appear to be of the nature
                            or scope that we would expect to precede a major change in the nature of
                            Communist military activity in Laos or Vietnam such as an overt
                            offensive. We have seen no significant increases of ground force
                            strength in South China or the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; the
                            net increase in Communist ground strength in Laos is estimated to be no
                            more than a few thousand at the most; and no large organized military
                            units are known to have moved into South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Peiping has recently extended by one year the terms of service for all
                            its armed forces. This is probably designed to improve capabilities by
                            retaining trained personnel, and it may result in a very substantial
                            increase in the size of the armed forces. We believe that this, along
                            with the program for development and production of more modern weapons
                            systems, is part of Peiping's longstanding effort to strengthen its
                            military establishment rather than an indication of an immediate Chinese
                            intention to mount offensive activity in Indochina.</p>
                        <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0364"/>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Increased Air Defense Capabilities</hi>. The
                            introduction of 50-odd jet fighters into North Vietnam and the increase
                            of Chinese air strength in the border area from 150 jet fighters to
                            about 350 appears to be responsive to a similar buildup of US air
                            strength in the area. This move gives the Communists a limited
                            capability to conduct surprise raids against Laos or the northern parts
                            of South Vietnam, especially for psychological effect. We do not believe
                            they will do so, however, because of the high risk of major US
                            retaliation and the consequent danger of air conflict with the US, a
                            form of hostilities most disadvantageous to the North Vietnamese and the
                            Chinese. Thus far, the Communists have not used aircraft to defend
                            forces in Laos against damaging T–28 attacks. We believe they will rely
                            on anti-aircraft artillery, ground fire, and passive defense in Laos.
                            However, they would certainly attempt to use fighters against air
                            strikes on North Vietnam, and would certainly do so in the case of an
                            attack on China.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Offensive Potential in Laos</hi>. The recent troop
                            reinforcements from North Vietnam have also somewhat increased Communist
                            offensive capabilities in Laos. In each spring since 1962, the
                            Communists have launched some ground activity designed to improve their
                            position during the dry season. We consider this sort of action likely
                            again this year.</p>
                        <p>7. A likely Communist move would be an attempt to recapture the junction
                            of Routes 7 and 13, lost to rightist forces last summer. The Communists
                            might estimate that they could attempt this without risking serious
                            escalation of the war. The Communists might also move against <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>'s position near Muong Soui. In
                            the panhandle, the Communists are likely to try to push the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> out of positions it has recently taken
                            along Route 9 in Operation “Victorious Arrow.” Though they are capable
                            of seizing any of the Mekong towns (e.g., Thakhek or Savannakhet) or
                            Seno, we do not believe they will attempt to do so, since they would
                            consider it involved undue risk of enlarged US counteraction.</p>
                        <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Military Portents in South Vietnam</hi>. In the past
                            year, the Communists have appreciably augmented the size, armament, and
                            general capabilities of Viet Cong (<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>)
                            forces with particular emphasis on their regular (“Main Force”) units.
                            Recent battles (e.g., Binh Gia) indicate that when the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> consider the circumstances favorable they
                            are willing to initiate battles with sizable <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> regular units. They have not yet willingly engaged
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> regular units except when they
                            outnumbered them at the point of attack. More probes and actions on the
                            order of Binh Gia are probable. We consider, however, that unless <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> military capabilities deteriorate
                            sharply, the chances are less than even that the next four or five
                            months will see prolonged offensives employing larger units.</p>
                        <p>9. The <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> military campaign will certainly
                            be carefully tailored to exploit and increase South Vietnam's political
                            and morale problems. For reasons of psychological warfare, the
                            Communists—unless and until <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0365"/>convinced that such actions carry unacceptable risks—will probably
                            essay further attacks against US facilities and personnel. The
                            Communists will also continue to improve their conventional capabilities
                            so that, if discord should split the GVN's military establishment, they
                            could, if they chose, take full military advantage of the situation.</p>
                        <p>10. Although Hanoi and Peiping are still apprehensive about the
                            possibility of US attacks on North Vietnam they are probably less so
                            than they were in the late autumn of 1964. For example, while the attack
                            in August on a De Soto patrol met with instant retaliation, US warships
                            later suspended these patrols. Communist action against Bien Hoa in
                            November and the bombing of the Brink BOQ in December did not produce
                            any military rejoinder. The Communists appear prepared to accept present
                            levels of US and US-sponsored activity and even to run the risk of some
                            escalation. Influential voices in the US opposing extension of the war
                            may have persuaded the Communists that the US is not disposed to
                            undertake major escalation.</p>
                        <p>11. In these circumstances, we believe that Hanoi and Peiping are
                            determined to continue their present policies in Laos and South Vietnam.
                            While the Communists are probably not yet ready to embark on a general
                            military offensive, it is almost certain that they will continue their
                            support of insurrectionary forces and will prepare to exploit any new
                            opportunities which arise in either Laos or South Vietnam.</p>

                            projected visit to North Vietnam carries forward the trend of increasing
                            Soviet involvement in this area which began directly after the fall of
                            Khrushchev. The new leaders apparently believe that Khrushchev erred in
                            leaving a dangerous situation largely in the hands of Peiping and that
                            his limited responses in past incidents may have encouraged the US to be
                            more aggressive. We believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> now hopes to rebuild influence in Hanoi and to deter
                            the US from expanding the scope of hostilities. To this end, the Soviets
                            will probably increase their military and economic assistance to North
                            Vietnam to include additional air defense equipment and perhaps jet
                            fighters and surface-to-air missiles. They will probably also offer a
                            full line of equipment for use in insurgency and subversion. But we
                            doubt that the Soviets will undertake the military defense of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> or run very high risks to protect
                            it.</p>
                        <p>13. The Soviets almost certainly hope that North Vietnam will avoid
                            actions which might provoke US reprisals and produce further escalation.
                            Kosygin will probably urge this point of view in Hanoi, but the
                            intricacy of Sino-Soviet-North Vietnamese relations will require him to
                            maneuver carefully lest the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> seem
                            to be lacking enthusiasm for the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            cause.</p>
                        <p>14. Less Likely Contingencies. Our estimate of what the Communists
                            probably will do militarily in the near-term future falls far short of
                            our <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0366"/>appreciation of what they
                            could do against indigenous forces if the latter were not reinforced
                            from the outside. Using only forces already in Laos, the Communists
                            almost certainly have the capability to carry out actions such as the
                            following: to recapture the junction of Routes 7 and 13 in Laos and to
                            launch a subsequent drive on both Vientiane and Luang Prabang; to
                            capture Thakhek and Attopeu and to harass both Seno and Savanna-khet. At
                            the same time, the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> could be augmented
                            by some of the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces now in the
                            panhandle of Laos for a drive against the northern provinces of South
                            Vietnam. However, such moves are not likely unless Hanoi and Peiping are
                            willing to take the risk of direct and punishing attacks on at least
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> territory—or unless Hanoi and
                            Peiping should come to believe that Free World persuasion coupled with
                            internal US pressures would be strong enough to prevent such retaliation
                            and force the US to a negotiated settlement.</p>

                        <p>665. Although events have certainly not run their course, we are assuming
                            at this juncture that <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> have been eliminated for
                            foreseeable future from any effective role in Laos. Their departure from
                            the scene plainly changes situation drastically and we await with
                            interest your analysis of implications for US policy.</p>
                        <p>We here are very much in doubt as to the effects. We would of course
                            agree with Australian Ambassador's view (Embtel 1219)<note n="2" xml:id="d166fn2">Dated February 4. (Ibid.)</note> that departure of
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> removes disruptive elements but we
                            wonder whether he has given adequate weight to dangers which have
                            simultaneously been enhanced. While we are far from concluding that it
                            is inevitable, it is certainly possible that the Sananikones and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, seeing their
                            opposition evaporate, may move swiftly to undermine Souvanna, the <gloss target="#t_GNU1">GNU</gloss> and the Geneva settlement and to
                            establish undivided control of legitimate and illegitimate business in
                            Vientiane. A second danger, <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0367"/>related to the first, is that the leaders in southern Laos may refuse
                            to cooperate with Vientiane and/or fragment after failing to find a
                            rallying point to replace <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>,
                            with all that this would mean in terms of resist-ance to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and our support for it. A third element
                            in the equation is the reaction of Vang Pao to what has transpired.</p>
                        <p>While we shall no doubt have to leave the working out of these affairs to
                            the Lao and especially to Souvanna, US influence on developments will be
                            substantial. It is therefore important that we come to a common
                            assessment of the situation and agreed broad lines of action as soon as
                            possible.</p>

                        <p>1237. Since occidental mind persists in illusion that we can explain
                            things that happen in Laos, I will attempt in this message to
                            reconstruct some sort of explanation for events of past week. I will
                            also speculate somewhat on probable events for next week. However, in
                            general, I feel it unproductive to consider things Laotian in time span

                        <p>It now seems clear in retrospect that Bounleut action which began January
                            31 was protest action mounted quite independently of <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> coup effort. Bounleut, who is fairly decent type,
                            but not too bright, had for some time past indicated his desire to break
                            out of vicious circle of power politics and corruption afflicting
                            army-police relationships in Vientiane (<gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> CX–13).<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2">Dated January 8.

                            saw in Bounleut's action an opportunity to precipitate his plans. His
                            basic miscalculations were twofold: (1) he did not have adequate forces
                            loyal to him and (2) he underestimated willingness of ability of
                                <persName corresp="#p_OR1">Ouane</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> forces to fight when

                            independent position, hoping to move in after <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> forces had exhausted each other or
                            stalemated. He was, however, frustrated in this purpose by fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, who has long borne
                            unyielding enmity towards <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>,
                            chose to shove <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>'s forces into
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s arms and take care of
                            both of them simultaneously. Despite callous unconcern for civilian
                            population in which <persName corresp="#p_OR1">Ouane</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>
                            forces carried this out, one has to admit that their tactics were sound
                            and their forces surprisingly effective.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna, ever since April 19, has had to balance himself between
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>'s forces
                            representing the Sananikones and <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>'s forces, representing an unknown and volatile
                            quantity, constantly susceptible to <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s intrigue. In his actions during late December
                            and January, culminating in military conference at Luang Prabang January
                            13–14, Souvanna clearly chose to throw in his lot with <persName corresp="#p_OR1">Ouane</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, obviously choosing the devil he knew rather
                            than chance his future in collaboration with <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>. The firmness of the resolve is indicated by the
                            grim tenacity with which Souvanna pursued and directed the annihilation
                            of <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> forces during the fighting February
                            3.</p>
                        <p>Immediate military problem now is to assure that organization which
                            Souvanna endorses under leadership <persName corresp="#p_OR1">Ouane</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> can indeed assert its authority over <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> officers, most of whom derived their
                            original strength from <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>.
                            Even such patriotic professionals as Phasouk and Vang Pao retain
                            sentimental attachment to <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            and have expressed reluctance submit themselves “to <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>.” Unless Souvanna can
                            completely isolate <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> from
                            contact with these men he will continue to have trouble within his
                            military structure. Most serious kernel of trouble still unresolved on
                            military side is problem of Kham-khong, who with his region II forces in
                            immediate vicinity Vientiane, remains a critical threat to this capital.
                            Souvanna has asked our assist-ance in treating with this problem and we
                            are providing it in low key. A long trip abroad for Khamkhong is one
                            solution under consideration.</p>
                        <p>Immediate political problem for Souvanna consists of need for
                            reconstituting conservative political wing. This has always been a
                            coalition <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0369"/>of families, regions
                            and military forces. Its strength in the south can still be centered on
                            Prince Boun Oum. Its strength in the center is now very largely in the
                            hands of the Sananikones. Souvanna says he will attempt to bring Boun
                            Oum into government. I thoroughly doubt Boun Oum will accept any such
                            subordinate position. However he may designate some representative such
                            as Leuam Insisiengmay to handle his interests and be his spokesman in
                            coalition with the Sananikones. It will be recalled (Embtel 965)<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">Dated December 29. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, POL 15–1 LAOS)</note> that <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui Sananikone</persName> gave me his solemn assurance that the

                            and ask that he use his influence with <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> to establish similar moderation in
                                <persName>Sananikone</persName> dominance of armed forces. <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> is already showing signs that
                            he recognizes need for this moderation, at least tactically and for the
                            time being. Nevertheless, he is an ambitious young man and we will have
                            a constant problem reining in his future ambitions.</p>
                        <p>As I said at the outset of this message, I do not intend look beyond next
                            Sunday in prognosis for things to come. However, I would venture the
                            estimate that this coming week will be somewhat calmer than the week
                            just past.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to include armed route
                            reconnaissance and low/medium level photography, I wish enter note of
                            caution insofar as his proposal may be interpreted as desire extend
                            current Barrel Roll and Yankee Team operations from Laos into <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. I have discussed this matter with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and have
                            advised him of my intention write this message. I think he and I are in
                            agreement on this subject but do not presume speak for him in this
                            message. He will doubtless wish comment separately.</p>
                        <p>Problem in brief is as follows: Laos, unlike South Vietnam, is incapable
                            protecting itself against ground action by <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and does not have US commitment assure such protection.
                            It therefore becomes highly important to Souvanna to be able to state
                            that his territory and air space are not being used for actions against
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. If he can maintain this
                            posture, he believes he will have continuing general support from Soviet
                            Union and its support will provide check against overt DRV incursions
                            into Laos. Fragile as this belief may be, we must accept it as basic
                            element Souvanna's outlook and respect it if we are to expect his
                            continued cooperation in other enterprises this area.</p>
                        <p>He has no objection to massive US punishment of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> within <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> itself. He
                            has no objection to clandestine US punishment of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Pathet Lao within Laos. However, he strictly
                            insists two must be kept separate so that he can maintain aforementioned
                            sophistry of innocence in his international dealings, particularly with
                            Soviets. This is a very tricky balance, but one which I think we can
                            respect with a little extra effort on our part.</p>
                        <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>To maintain this respect, I would therefore take exception to concept of
                            extending Barrel Roll and Yankee Team into <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. These two programs were developed for operations
                            exclusively in Laos, and I believe tricky nature our operations require
                            them to stay (however artificially) in that same compartment. If armed
                            recce and low/medium level photography programs established for DRV, I
                            believe they should be separate from Lao programs and not ignore
                            international boundary between Laos and <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Partly because of need preserve this artificial distinction as well as
                            because of material advantages to be gained, I have welcomed <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> proposals establish Yankee Team out
                            of Udorn. It seems to me that this small group of aircraft and pilots,
                            operating exclusively over Laos, will develop special skills which will
                            materially improve the quality of intelligence we accumulate here.</p>
                        <p>The thought arises, although I will not advance it here, that there might
                            be some prospect for compartmentalizing and specializing Barrel Roll in
                            this same manner. Especially as Rolling Thunder program gains momentum
                            and occupies both Second Air Divison and Fleet air assets, it may be of
                            some value to designate some separate unit, to be based in Thailand, for
                            specific purpose conducting our relatively modest Barrel Roll program.
                            As layman, I have been impressed with capabilities of A–1–H aircraft in
                            Barrel Roll operations, and particularly with their ability (relative to
                            jets) to absorb anti-aircraft damage. This factor is of significant
                            concern to us in connection with our <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss>
                            responsibilities, which we take very seriously. I won't ask in this
                            message whether there would be an A–1–H equipped marine air unit
                            available for such duty, since I feel this would be unwarranted
                            intrusion into the very complex problem of US air dispositions in this
                            overall theater, something well beyond our perspective as we peer out
                            from the jungle canopy of Laos. However, from our very limited
                            perspective, such a disposition would have its attractions.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary said he would like to make some comment today as part of a
                            review of questions of mutual interest, perhaps the first of a series of
                            sessions. He recalled that he and Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had discussed a number of
                            matters in their five meetings last fall.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">Apparent reference to meetings between <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> at the United Nations during the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly session,
                                November–December 1964.</note> We continue to be interested in
                            possibilities for the improvement of relations between our two
                            countries. We do believe that we two have heavy responsibilities in
                            world affairs and that we must be very attentive to how we exercise
                            these responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wished to turn to the situation in Southeast Asia
                            and to comment in part on the history of the past four years. When
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> became
                            President (and, he noted, Mr. <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0375"/>became Vice President) he
                            looked at the situation in Southeast Asia and felt that here the largest
                            interests of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. need not be in conflict, and that
                            both therefore should try to find ways to help bring peace and security
                            to the area. When this was discussed with Mr. Khrushchev at Vienna, it
                            seemed to us that there was mutual agreement that Laos should not be a
                            bone of contention. This agreement opened the way for negotiations on
                            Laos, and the Geneva Accords of 1962 underlined the concept that if
                            everyone left Laos alone Laos could develop peaceably and independently.
                            This was an understanding of major significance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in reaching that agreement (1962 Geneva Accords)
                            the United States had made some important concessions to views not held
                            previously, namely we (1) accepted Souvanna as Prime Minister and (2)
                            accepted the idea of a government of national union. Subsequently we
                            took various steps to reinforce the agreements. Last year we supported
                            Prime Minister Souvanna fully when he was opposed by rightist groups and
                            helped him restore stability. We supported Souvanna again when he
                            encountered difficulties with Generals <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and Siho and the police forces.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that as we understand the significance of our
                            information: (1) North Vietnamese military personnel in Laos never
                            dropped below six thousand; (2) continuously since 1962 Laos has been
                            used by North Vietnam for infiltration into South Vietnam—this directly
                            contrary to the agreement; (3) the Pathet Lao last year moved against
                            the neutralist elements on the Plaine des Jarres forcing us to take
                            action. “Let's find a common basis of facts.” We believed in 1962 that
                            we had an agreement. This was a very important development, a way by
                            which we could find a basis of mutual interest. The actions of Hanoi and
                            the Pathet Lao have prevented this.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had talked with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in December<note n="3" xml:id="d170fn3">See <ref target="#d149">Document 149</ref>.</note> concerning some way to
                            return to the agreement. One question was that of further talks between
                            the three Laotian factions—with the obstacle that the Pathet Lao
                            suggested Souvanna not go (to talks) as Prime Minister but rather as
                            chairman of the three factions. Souvanna has tried to have contact for
                            talks with Prince <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> but without success. The Secretary
                            wondered what the Soviets might think about the prospect for talks
                            between Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that under the 1962 Accords (Article 19 to be
                            specific) the co-chairmen have the responsibility for reporting by July
                            1 of this year with regard to the effectiveness of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. The British Government is aware of
                            this. Perhaps the two co-chairmen may wish to consult <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0376"/>with each other, with members of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and, possibly, with some of the
                            other signatories. This might open the way for a constructive process
                            leading to a return to the '62 Accords. The Secretary stressed that our
                            sole logic is capital and meticulous compliance with the '62 Accords
                            and, as far as we are concerned, we will do everything to bring this
                            about.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that a big problem with regard to a conference is
                            whether it would begin where the last one ended or where the last one
                            began. There would be no prospects for success if we had to start all
                            over again from the beginning. On the other hand, we've never seen any
                            evidence that the Pathet Lao (or Hanoi) ever really adhered to the
                            agreements. The Secretary hoped that our two governments can find ways
                            to limit the causes of tension. Noting that during the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>-<persName>Johnson</persName>
                            period the 1962 Accords and the Test Ban Treaty were seen as two
                            important ways to reach accord and reduce tensions, the Secretary said
                            it is important for us to find ways these two agreements can be made
                            effective and carried out.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the situation in South Vietnam where there has been no
                            bilateral agreement comparable to the one achieved on Laos in Vienna in
                            1961, we have no doubts whatsoever concerning the facts of North
                            Vietnamese infiltration, the introduction of arms, personnel and units
                            into South Vietnam. The Secretary stressed that we have made it clear
                            many times that if South Vietnam were left free of efforts to bring it
                            down from the outside we would be perfectly willing to pull out and go
                            home. However, we have very serious commitments there to the South
                            Vietnamese government and people, commitments which we intend to honor.
                            We do not accept the view that what is happening in Vietnam is
                            indigenous. It is no more indigenous than the conflict in Korea was
                            indigenous. (At Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s request the Secretary explained the meaning
                            of the word indigenous.) Neither we nor the South Vietnamese can accept
                            that the supplying of arms and intrusion from the North is merely part
                            of a “civil struggle”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that more talks are needed to clarify the issues and
                            to improve our understanding of one another in the interest of peace in
                            Southeast Asia. The United States does not want any larger or expanded
                            conflict in the area but we do consider the safety and the security of
                            the people of South Vietnam to be most important. We cannot sit by and
                            allow them to become innocent victims. The Secretary said that for
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>'s private
                            information we have had a number of contacts with Peiping along the way
                            and, indirectly, also with Hanoi. Despite these and other channels of
                            communication we have not seen any indication that Hanoi is prepared to
                            stop what it is doing in South Vietnam. This is a key point, a central
                            point. (Asked if the Soviets had received any such indication from
                            Hanoi, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> was
                            evasive.) Our going home is an idea which we might entertain if Hanoi
                                <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0377"/>would actually stop doing
                            what it is doing in South Vietnam. We are not going to pull out and
                            leave South Vietnam to be overrun by North Vietnam. The Secretary asked
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> inform
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> of this firm U.S.
                            position. The Secretary said that if there continued to be disagreement
                            as to the facts of the situation in Vietnam it is important that the
                            matter be discussed further at the Ambassador's earliest convenience in
                            an effort to make progress toward mutual understanding.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows discussion on the Geneva Disarmament Conference, East-West
                            trade, and the German question.]</p>
                        <p>Presented the opportunity to address himself to the Secretary's remarks,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the
                            Soviet positions on developments in Southeast Asia are very well known
                            and that consequently he would not review them in detail. As for
                            speaking about the improvement in our bilateral relations, these depend
                            very much on the previously mentioned developments in Southeast Asia. In
                            other words, when you Americans bomb North Vietnam we are very concerned
                            that if you continue the bombing and military intervention in North
                            Vietnam this can cause a spreading of the conflict into one of a larger
                            scale. This creates an immediate and important danger. (The Ambassador
                            avoided answering a question by the Secretary as to the Soviet attitude
                            with regard to stopping what is going on in South Vietnam.) Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> then compared the
                            scope of the U.S. military effort in Vietnam to the assistance granted
                            the Viet Cong by the North Vietnamese. Who can believe that in addition
                            to 300,000 South Vietnamese troops, the mighty U.S. with many aircraft,
                            25,000 troops, missiles and so forth is not capable of crushing the few
                            men with limited equipment who come in from North Vietnam? In other
                            words, even if one accepted the figures of the State Department's White
                            Paper with regard to the scale of North Vietnamese assistance this
                            assistance is very small compared to the scale of opposing U.S.
                            assistance. The only answer is that the peoples of South Vietnam do not
                            support the U.S. effort. The Soviet Union cannot accept the logic that
                            military failures in South Vietnam justify U.S. attacks on North
                            Vietnam. Just as in the fighting against the French, the majority of the
                            Vietnamese are now fighting the U.S. There was a discussion of guerrilla
                            warfare techniques and whether or not they can be effective without
                            truly popular support.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> continued that
                            the U.S. has started a new policy. At first it ostensibly was a policy
                            of reprisal, bombing North Vietnam because of actions against Americans
                            in South Vietnam. He asked what the policy was today? Things have been
                            quiet in Vietnam and now the Americans bomb the North without any claims
                            that this is reprisal action. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that the Soviet Union wants better
                            relations, but that they are convinced that what the U.S. is now doing
                                <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0378"/>cannot lead to any peaceful
                            solution in the area. He ignored a question from the Secretary as to
                            what his people think about Hanoi's activity and whether that activity
                            can lead to a peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> stressed the
                            importance of stopping the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam as the first
                            imperative if there is going to be any search for peaceful solutions. He
                            asked where does one go from there if the bombing is not stopped. The
                            Secretary said that one place to start would be a return to the 1962
                            agreements on Laos. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> repeated that bombardment does not lead to
                            peaceful solutions. The Secretary responded with a reference to the
                            apparent Soviet desire that we desert the South Vietnamese, leaving them
                            in the position of a petrified rabbit waiting for a snake. In another
                            vein, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>
                            deplored some talk that he has heard around Washington which supports
                            strong U.S. measures as necessary to prove that the U.S. is not
                            frightened. He said that this is ridiculous, that the U.S. is mighty and
                            powerful and “nobody thinks you are scared”. The Secretary said we
                            weren't.</p>
                        <p>As to a resumption of the Geneva disarmament talks Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName>, speaking personally, asked
                            what kind of an atmosphere would it be to sit down and talk in Geneva at
                            the very same time as the U.S. is bombing North Vietnam. He said that
                            the suggestion seem inconsistent or at least unrealistic to completely
                            divorce the actions in Vietnam from other questions. The Secretary
                            commented that disarmament is a long-term problem and one we should
                            continue to work despite disagreements elsewhere. He asked if the matter
                            of the arms race in the Near East might not also be a problem which
                            could be usefully considered in the Geneva context. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> reaffirmed his personal
                            feeling that U.S. actions in North Vietnam created an atmosphere which
                            is not conducive to talks on disarmament and related matters.</p>
                        <p>As the conversation concluded, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> said that he would report everything that the
                            Secretary had said to his government and again stated that the Soviet
                            Union was greatly concerned over the dangerous situation in Vietnam. The
                            Secretary responded that the situation would be much less dangerous if
                            everyone stayed behind his own frontiers.</p>

                                    Bundy</persName> asked for <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s “personal judgement” as to Souvanna's
                                reaction to an increased Barrel Roll program as a “useful added
                                signal to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.” If <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> thought additional
                                operations desirable, he should specify the types and objectives.
                                (Ibid.)</note> It is difficult assess from here exactly what signal
                            Hanoi has received from Barrel Roll operations in Laos. My personal
                            judgment would be that it has probably to date been somewhat scattered,
                            largely because program itself has been scattered.</p>
                        <p>Our primary concern at current moment is to reshape this program into
                            more systematic operation, which will then perhaps produce better
                            defined and more clearly understood signal to Hanoi. In my view, this
                            reshaping does not involve increase in scale and only partly involves
                            increase in frequency.</p>
                        <p>Structure of program we seek will be built around two general features:
                            (a) establishment and re-seeding of choke points which will enhance
                            interdiction of routes primarily used for DRV infiltration and supplies,
                            and (b) constant, random armed reconnaissance of those routes,
                            especially at night, by a group of pilots who have learned the terrain
                            and can fly these programs with assurance.</p>
                        <p>If we have four choke points established, and re-seed these every week,
                            we will, of course, have four operations per week pre-empted for these
                            purposes. If we wish keep saturation armed recce on four principal
                            routes, we will also have three or four operations per week on that
                            account. In general, therefore, there would seem some value in
                            considering the prospect of a systematic (but not spectacular) program
                            on a seven day per week basis.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the most important recommendation I could make is to have this
                            program run by one special contingent of planes and pilots who become
                            experts in the field. I feel this is most critical if we are to avoid
                            the political hoorah which eventuates when a mission somehow goes astray
                            (e.g. Barrel Roll 39). I also feel it important in terms of safety for
                            the pilots themselves who are required to fly with minimum navigation
                            over some pretty horrendous terrain.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason that I recently floated idea (Embtel 1365)<note n="3" xml:id="d171fn3">
                                <ref target="#d168">Document 168</ref>.</note> of a Thai-based unit
                            to carry out strike, seeding and recce missions involved <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0380"/>in Barrel Roll. I discussed these
                            thoughts with General Hunter Harris at Udorn Monday<note n="4" xml:id="d171fn4">March 2.</note> and found him very much in
                            agreement. Only exception he took to my views was his prejudice in favor
                            of jet aircraft to do the strike and rescap [?] jobs. (I don't want to
                            get involved in middle of service and equipment scrap on which I have no
                            qualifications whatsoever, but I feel I should report that junior
                            operational air officers involved in these programs show a distinct
                            preference for the A–1–H, which has longer time on target, more
                            capability to absorb flak, less likelihood of smacking into a mountain
                            at high speed, and more ability to stay with and protect choppers on
                                <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> missions.)</p>
                        <p>In sum, I believe a program systematically geared to interdiction of
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> routes into Laos, flown with
                            limited number specialized planes and pilots based in Thailand, and
                            continuously applied over a considerable stretch of time will get a
                            clearly audible signal to Hanoi. I do not rule out occasional
                            spectacular strikes, but, except for Ban Ken Bridge, believe they have
                            to date created more diversion than destruction.</p>
                        <p>As far as Souvanna is concerned, I believe program laid out above fits
                            precisely with his line of thinking and, indeed, needs no further
                            discussion with him. The only thing that gives him trouble is the
                            occasional big show in which we lose aircraft and provoke loud Communist
                            propaganda reaction.</p>

                            on Laos, <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and Thailand are
                            inseparable parts. Thai accordingly would not be able to see how new
                            initiatives now for multi-nation conference on Laos could avoid
                            encouraging demand for similar conferences on <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> with all its disadvantages or, even more importantly,
                            how talk of conference could avoid undermining position of strength we
                            are now painstakingly building up step by step in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and Laos.</p>
                        <p>We recognize risks French and Communists will attempt to shake faith in
                            US on part of Souvanna and other <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            leaders by suggesting US interested in Laos only in relation to <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss>. We are not persuaded, however, that only
                            way to convince Souvanna otherwise is to arrange separate negotiations
                            on Laos. Without publicly subscribing to French view, we find
                            considerable validity in Millet's statement to <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> (Vientiane's 1397 to

                        <p>Thai position has been made known to us whenever question of conference
                            has come up in connection with Laos, Vietnam or Cambodia and was
                            recently made explicit in authoritative article by diplomatic
                            correspondent close to FonMin (Emb A–668).<note n="5" xml:id="d172fn5">Dated March 5. (Ibid., POL 1 ASIA SE–US)</note> In discussing US

                            receptivity to conference at proper time, they have also indicated that
                            they do not believe that this time is at hand. They have made abundantly
                            clear in relation to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam that premature
                            conference or talk of conference on any one of these countries will have
                            adverse repercussions on our position in others. News article did not
                            even recognize any possibility of negotiation at present.</p>
                        <p>Although we believe we are today completely on same wave length with
                            Thai, should we encourage Souvanna to press for resumption of talks or
                            associate ourselves with co-chairmen dialogue, we are likely once again
                            to undermine Thai confidence. Top Thai officials have regretted damage
                            in this regard caused by columnists and others critical of our present
                            policy. Thanat has also expressed concern about ability of Souvanna to
                            continue to maintain his position in much narrowed political framework
                            of Vientiane; but we defer to Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s judgment (Vientiane's 1408) as to possibility
                            of greater internal pressures on Souvanna should he now attempt to
                            promote further negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Re last para ref Deptel, we are frankly puzzled. We have worked hard here
                            to get Thai to support Souvanna's authority as PriMin and as head of
                            coalition government. We had thought Souvanna also saw importance of
                            consistency in maintenance this position. If this is so, do not
                            understand what more we expect Souvanna to do in handling this problem
                            should Communists insist on right of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            to speak independently or should they challenge Souvanna's right to
                            speak for <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> without tripartite
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>We had thought from our reading on traffic re <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> approach on Article 19, that we were disinclined to see

                            consultation. Unless there is more to it than meets the eye, strongly
                            urge we do not sacrifice vital store of confidence in us built up at
                            considerable cost in <gloss target="#t_VN1">VN</gloss> and Thailand for

                            systematic operation built around two general features of (1)
                            chokepoints and (2) armed reconnaissance <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0383"/>of key routes with latter including secondary targets
                            of fixed installations, having in mind difficulties involved in shifting
                            targets without adequate preparation.</p>
                        <p>We also share your view that this reshaping should not involve increase
                            in scale and only partly increase in frequency. These considerations
                            important of course, as pointed out Embtel 1416, connection continued
                            acceptability of entire program to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            and specifically Souvanna. From Embtel 1393 we gather that you consider
                            schedule of four chokepoint-reseeding operations per week plus three (to
                            four) armed reconnaissance operations per week or a total of seven
                            operations per week as about right for systematic non-spectacular
                            program.</p>
                        <p>However pressures are developing to shape program into more than this by
                            increasing not only frequency of operations significantly but their
                            scale as well. Up until now we have been holding firm on four strike
                            aircraft for day armed reconnaissance missions and two to four strike
                            aircraft for night missions. In case of chokepoint or other special
                            missions strike aircraft have been kept to maximum of sixteen and flak
                            suppression aircraft to maximum of twelve (with exception reseeding
                            missions which are no more than twelve and twelve). Moreover there has
                            been 48-hour sterile period between day missions and 36 hours between
                            day and night missions, with special exception made in case of
                            chokepoint missions which exempt from sterile period injunction.</p>

                            standard armed recce missions reduced to 24 hours. If these new terms of
                            reference are accepted it seems to us that scale and frequency of Barrel
                            Roll operations will be in excess of non-spectacular program envisaged
                            Embtel 1393. Proposed chokepoint operations in Sam Neua (approved by
                            Vientiane) calling for four <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> operations
                            on consecutive days (one of which will have target 3 nm from Sam Neua
                            town) is another example of trend toward increase in scale and frequency
                            of <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> operations. These proposed
                            chokepoint operations, whether conducted on same day as <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> recommends or on consecutive
                            days as you prefer, would be significant departure from pattern and
                            scale of <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> program to date. With one
                            armed recce <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> per day and one chokepoint
                            reseeding <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> mission per day (given total
                            eight chokepoints) likely we could have two Barrel Roll missions any

                            to have in any 24-hour period a re-seeding mission, one or more route

                        </p>
                        <p>(A) Before I consult with Souvanna and prior receipt anticipated <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> message re Steel Tiger,<note n="3" xml:id="d175fn3">See <ref target="#d174fn4">footnote 4, Document
                                    174</ref>.</note> I should like to make a few observations and
                            pose one or two questions on this program.</p>
                        <p>(1) It should be recognized that our air operations in Laos are entirely
                            dependent upon the political authority granted us by Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. The fact
                            that this card carrying neutralist permits US aircraft to conduct combat
                            missions against enemy targets on Laotian soil is the result of very
                            carefully nourished relations which my predecessor skillfully began and
                            which I have attempted perpetuate. It bespeaks not only Souvanna's total
                            disgust with North Vietnamese but also his remarkable confidence in
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>(2) This confidence in US was not always present in Souvanna's
                            calculations. Our policy in 1960–61 evaporated it in his mind almost to
                            vanishing point. Even today, it is constantly under attack especially by
                            such “friendly” elements as the French.</p>
                        <p>(3) To my mind, the continued nourishment of Souvanna's confidence in US
                            requires several things:</p>
                        <p>(a) Absolute frankness with him;</p>
                        <p>(b) Correlation US operations with Laotian national interests;</p>
                        <p>(c) Assurance that US air operations will be conducted in meticulously
                            careful manner, aborting missions when there exists any question of
                            damage to friendly villagers;</p>
                        <p>(d) Close and careful coordination with Royal Lao forces;</p>
                        <p>(e) Careful observance of conditions stipulated by Souvanna (e.g.
                            publicity).</p>
                        <p>(4) While, in this catalogue all elements are important, 3 (c) is perhaps
                            the single point on which I would bear down most heavily. Laos is not
                            North Vietnam. It is not even Viet Cong held territory in South Vietnam.
                            Laos is a friendly country and the villagers are a considerable asset to
                            us. The Viet Minh (even to a large extent the Pathet Lao) are an enemy
                            expeditionary force operating in territory which is hostile to them. The
                                <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0387"/>guerrillas in this country
                            are not only friendly to us, they are our guerrillas. This mission is
                            not only their paymaster and their quartermaster; we give them their
                            orders and direct their operations; it is therefore highly important
                            that any air operations conducted in Laos be carefully mindful of our
                            valuable assets here.</p>
                        <p>This means, in my opinion, that we must bend over backwards in executing
                            our military missions so that we maintain this unique and essential
                            political foundation for our operations. It means that we must sometimes
                            sacrifice maximum military opportunities, in order to temper them to the
                            political climate. For example, we have, since beginning of this
                            program, denied ourselves use of napalm “until it is absolutely required
                            for significant military reasons in highly critical situation.” This
                            sort of situation is unlikely arise in purely interdictory-type missions
                            and we must therefore maintain this self-abnegation until it does.</p>
                        <p>(5) In elaborating on point 3 (d) I would like to correct the apparently
                            erroneous assumption in reftel that there is “boundary” between US and
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> operations in Panhandle. This
                            is not so. <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> is free to operate
                            anywhere in Panhandle. There is, however, unilateral restriction against
                            US operations along and west of Route 23, south of Route 9. But it must
                            be borne in mind that <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>, which takes
                            highly deserved pride in its own operations, reserves its priority to
                            strike targets anywhere in Laos. In principle, our operations have to be
                            fitted around theirs. In practice, careful handling of General Ma
                            reduces this problem to manageable proportions.</p>
                        <p>(B) Having recited this preamble, I wish to say that I welcome concept of
                            dividing our air missions into “Barrel Roll” and “Steel Tiger”
                            categories. I think operations can be managed somewhat more effectively
                            if they are so configured. I would warn, however, against any
                            indications to Lao, or others, that we are making this distinction. In
                            order have full support and coordination, we need preserve identity Lao
                            national interests with all we do.</p>
                        <p>There follow certain questions and suggestions which flow from proposed
                            program:</p>
                        <p>(1) How would geographic boundary between Barrel Roll and Steel Tiger be
                            defined? I would suggest Routes 6, 7 and 8 fall within Barrel Roll;
                            Routes 12, 9, 23 and trail complex south of Route 9 within Steel
                            Tiger.</p>
                        <p>(2) How would <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> for Steel Tiger be
                            managed? I would suggest <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> assume
                            primary operational responsibility from Nakorn Phanom, supplemented by
                            Air America, <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> and other in-country
                            assets as necessary.</p>
                        <p>(3) How would Barrel Roll be managed to be “solely responsive to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> requirements” as defined by this
                            Embassy? I would renew my suggestion that special unit of aircraft and
                            pilots be stationed Thailand <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0388"/>(preferable Udorn) to carry out bread-and-butter portion Barrel Roll,
                            supplemented as needed from time to time by <gloss target="#t_PACFLT1">PACFLT</gloss> and Second Air Division assets for bigger
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>(C) Foregoing questions, plus several other features Steel Tiger program,
                            would seem to require conference among principal responsible elements to
                            achieve closer understandings than we can accomplish by exchange cables.
                            I would therefore propose meeting appropriate author-ities at Udorn
                            sometime later this week (perhaps Saturday, March 27). Believe this
                            should involve senior reps from Embassies Bangkok and Vientiane, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CINCPACAF1">CINCPACAF</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CINCPACFLT1">CINCPACFLT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>

                        <p>Fully agree with reftel A that in proceeding with our air activities in

                            therefore that we continue to take necessary steps to ensure retention
                            Souvanna's confidence. This requires, as you state, absolute frankness
                            with him and for this reason we indicated in Deptel 809 that you should
                            consult with Souvanna, as you considered necessary, re decision to
                            intensify certain air operations in Laos. We also agree with other
                            considerations (B–E of subparagraph A, 3) which you consider important
                            for this purpose and especially 3 (C).</p>
                        <p>There no misunderstanding over restriction on US operations in area

                        <p>Agree that division we have made into Barrel Roll and Steel Tiger

                        <p>1. Barrel Roll and Steel Tiger have been separated in order to increase
                            operational effectiveness of interdiction of infiltration routes into
                            South Vietnam. Thus decision to place Route 8 (<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> 7624, DTG 231953Z)<note n="7" xml:id="d176fn7">Dated
                                March 23. (Ibid.)</note> under Steel Tiger has been made on
                            functional basis.</p>
                        <p>2. It envisaged that <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> operations would
                            continue as at present. However you may wish to discuss this subject at
                            proposed meeting and submit any comments or recommendations which may
                            develop.</p>
                        <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0390"/>
                        <p>3. Assumption with respect to new Barrel Roll is that, by being
                            exclusively based on your requests, these missions will be more
                            responsive to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> requirements.
                            Concerning your suggestion on special unit based in Thailand, suggest
                            this be discussed with military representatives at conference as to
                            feasibility and desirability. Assume that in recommending Udorn you have
                            considered likelihood that publicity problem would be much more
                            difficult to handle there than at other base in Thailand such as
                            Takhli.</p>

                            provide the neutralist and rightist elements a new opportunity to press
                            for full implementation of the 1962 Accords.<note n="3" xml:id="d177fn3">In Secto 8 from Tehran, April 6, <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that he thought the Department of State should

                                would provide an opportunity for building a record of insistence on
                                compliance with already signed agreements of 1962. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> thought such an approach would
                                dispell international confusion on U.S. policy toward Laos.
                                (Ibid.)</note> Whether or not the Pathet Lao proved less
                            intransigent than in the past, we would have a further opportunity to
                            build a record on our side that all we want is assured compliance with
                            solemn agreements already reached. This record could be important for
                            the communists and for those non-communist countries which are confused
                            about the real issues. In speaking to Souvanna along these lines, you
                            may wish to recall for him the Secretary's letter of November 30 (Deptel

                        <p>1712. For <persName>Bundy</persName>. During <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting participants were briefed by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> on <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposals for extensive new U.S. troop deployments
                            Southeast Asia. Since I believe execution of these proposals would have
                            widespread reactions in all countries this region, you may find it of
                            some use to have my judgment re probable Lao reactions to these
                            deployments.</p>
                        <p>First, as I have reported, Lao believe our methodical bombardment of
                            North Vietnam is correct and will produce results. They are perhaps more
                            optimistic than we that in reasonable period of time <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Viet Cong morale will collapse and
                            they will sue for peace on terms acceptable to us. They have taken great
                            heart from our actions and have gained a new confidence in their own
                            future.</p>
                        <p>If we, by proposed deployments, indicate we, on other hand, have lost
                            confidence in prospect that bombardment will produce results, Lao will
                            rethink their own estimates. They will probably interpret our
                            deployments as evidence of panic and this atmosphere can be very
                            infectious.</p>
                        <p>Second, despite many earlier misgivings and in the face of Communist and
                            French propaganda to contrary, Lao accept idea that we have no colonial
                            or neo-colonial ambitions here. A massive occupation of South Vietnam by
                            U.S. forces except in extremis would also cause this assumption to be
                            re-examined.</p>
                        <p>Net result of these two factors would, in my judgment, be considerable
                            diminution in Lao confidence re U.S. objectives and capabilities.
                            Practical consequences would probably include much less active
                            cooperation with us in our current military operations and a rather
                            headlong rush to embrace French policy of “negotiated neutrality” for
                            Southeast Asia.</p>

                                Vientaine, was sent to the Department as telegram 3464, April 21. It
                                contained an account of the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meetings of April 20–21. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, DEF 1 ASIA SE)</note> During recent <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting Saigon, participants
                            discussed proposed cross border operations into Laos. Focus of
                            discussion was Ref B, in which <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            laid out three phase concept of operations. It was noted that Ref B was
                            based on, but departed from, initial operating concepts laid out in Ref
                            A, which had been approved by earlier <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting last September. It was further noted that
                            none of cross border operations authorized in that earlier message had
                            been executed as yet.</p>
                        <p>After considerable discussion, we reached a meeting of minds on steps to
                            be taken and I agreed reduce this to writing in form of comment on Ref
                            B. This message represents that comment and indicates action in which I
                            would be prepared concur.</p>
                        <p>(A) I would agree that all actions contemplated paras 2 A through 2 D of
                            Ref A could be carried out as previously programmed. That is to say that
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> assets could operate in all
                            three zones in accordance with their capabilities and
                            characteristics.</p>
                        <p>(B) I would be prepared modify Vientiane position reflected para 2 E Ref
                            A to the extent that I would agree to presence U.S. advisors
                            accompanying ground units infiltrated overland in two southern zones of
                            operation, provided it is clear that they will penetrate only up to an
                            eventual depth of 20 kms and provided they will remain in penetration
                            areas no longer than ten days. I do not concur in presence U.S. advisors
                            introduced by paradrop or by helicopter, or by light aircraft. I further
                            do not concur in presence U.S. advisors with any <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> teams which may be introduced (a la
                            Leaping Lena) in northern region around Route 9. After some experience
                            with overland operations in two southern areas, I would be prepared
                            consider possibility linking up these two zones or otherwise expanding
                            operations with U.S. advisors in shallow penetration overland operations
                            in this sparsely occupied area of Panhandle. I would wish to consider
                            this request, however, in the light of some established <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0393"/>operational experience. All other
                            provisions Ref A would continue apply.</p>
                        <p>(C) As for region in vicinity Route 9, I am convinced it is so sensitive
                            and so well guarded that introduction any assets there runs high risk
                            capture. However, if <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss> wishes
                            introduce AVRN agents in same manner and under same ground rules as 34 A
                            assets in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, I would not object. To
                            send Americans would, in my view, be suicide and would also be
                            politically counterproductive.</p>
                        <p>(D) As for follow-on phases in proposed concept, I wish to reserve all
                            judgment pending some operational experience in Phase I. I see no need
                            make commitments to entire three phase concept at this time.</p>
                        <p>(E) The rather wistful expansion of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s concept proposed in <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s message (Ref C) strikes me as an old White Star
                            ghost pulling my leg. It is, in my view, totally unrealistic to think in
                            these terms under today's circumstances. In fact, I have some doubts it
                            has ever been or would ever be realistic. The hill areas of the
                            Panhandle accessible from the Bolovens are very sparsely populated
                            (perhaps 15,000 people at most). These are the most primitive tribes,
                            civilizations removed from the Meo or the Rhade, or the Jurai. They do
                            not ordinarily hunt with firearms but with crossbows, etc. The firearms
                            which an earlier White Star generation gave them were turned in (and
                            collected by) the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> because the Lao
                            did not consider it safe to have them loose in the hills. It is, in my
                            view, far-fetched to think of storming the Ho Chi Minh Trail with a bare
                            bottomed bunch of these boys.</p>
                        <p>(F) In the final analysis, my feeling is that in the Laos Panhandle a
                            little intelligence scouting, with luck a little sabotage, and maybe
                            even a little interception can be done by assets foreseeable available
                            to be spared from the counterinsurgency effort in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. This could be all accomplished in
                            southern reaches of Panhandle. But if there is any serious intent to
                            break up the real marrow of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the area where the
                            Viets truly protect it by organic battalions, we had better start
                            thinking in terms of regiments and divisions, and not tribal assets.</p>
                        <p>(G) Finally, I hope <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss> will be fully
                            briefed on <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operations which we are
                            already running and expanding in the Panhandle. These, it seems to me,
                            have the best chance of being profitable. An <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss> visit to 333 Headquarters in Udorn might be useful.</p>

                            request for suggestions as to what we might do in regard to future
                            diplomatic invitations. Most of what I would suggest could be used
                            whether or not the Cambodian conference fails.<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">On March 15 the Cambodian Government requested that
                                the Geneva Co-Chairmen convoke a meeting of the participants of the
                                1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to consider the question of the
                                neutrality and territorial integrity of Cambodia. The text of the
                                message is in American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965, pp.
                                715–716.</note> Some of it should be given a harder push if we don't
                            get the Cambodian conference.</p>
                        <p>1. Actual negotiations on any subject. I do not believe we should
                            specifically call for a conference on Viet-Nam itself unless and until
                            we have some real sign of “give” from Hanoi. My best guess is that we
                            will not get such a sign in the near future, and to propose a conference
                            in the absence of it would have demoralizing effects in Saigon and might
                            build up tremendous pressures for us to stop bombing.</p>
                        <p>This leaves the possibility of negotiation on Laos. Both the Soviets and
                            Hanoi called for a Laos conference in their recent communiqué.<note n="4" xml:id="d180fn4">Reference is to the joint <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> communiqué of April 17, issued at the end of a

                                pp. 855–856.</note> We have never been against such a conference in
                            principle, but have fully supported <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> in insisting that the Communist side must first
                            recognize Souvanna's own position and be prepared to permit the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to operate in the Communist areas
                            (including the infiltration routes). Last spring, Souvanna, with our
                            support, also insisted that the Communist side withdraw from the
                            territory it had taken over in its military offensive last May; however,
                            the subsequent Government gains north of Vientiane pretty well canceled
                            this out and we would not need to insist on this precondition now.
                            However, the other two conditions do <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0395"/>remain important, the Communist side has shown no signs
                            of yielding on them, and to go ahead on a conference without satisfying
                            them would run serious risks of undermining Souvanna's internal
                            political position with his generals and others potentially opposed to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>The present state of the bidding is that preliminary talks are under way
                            in Laos simply to fix on an agreed site, also in Laos, for further
                            talks. Although the Communists are hurting in Laos, there is as yet no
                            clear sign that they really want to accept even the political and <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> provisions of the 1962 Accord, much
                            less permit the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to do a job in the
                            infiltration areas.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, if the Cambodian conference fell through, we have one avenue
                            for discussion on Laos that avoids the tricky problem of Souvanna's
                            conditions. The British, on February 2, proposed to the Soviets that the
                            two co-chairmen get together to discuss the continuation and functions
                            of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>. This approach was in
                            accordance with Article 19 of the 1962 agreements, which provides
                            specifically for such co-chairman action prior to July 1965, when the
                                <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> technically expires. The Soviets
                            have not replied to the British initiative. Since we believe they really
                            meant it about the Cambodian conference, they might be prepared to pick
                            up the Laos gambit if the Cambodian conference falls through. (I doubt
                            it otherwise.)</p>
                        <p>This would mean, not an immediate conference, but a meeting of the
                            co-chairmen in the first place, possibly with invitations to the members
                            of the 1962 conference to come and express their views. We could get
                            some sort of informal gathering, at first, which might develop into a
                            full-scale conference or not, but which would at least show that we were
                            still working for discussions. The gathering would also provide
                            opportunity for the same sort of corridor contacts we have envisaged as
                            possible in the Cambodian conference—even though we do not now think the
                            Communist side would be taking advantage of them.</p>

                        <p>982. With prospective Cambodia conference pretty well out of the window,
                            we are giving thought once again to possibility of Laos conference.
                            Although British have not yet mentioned this to us, we suspect they will
                            soon be reviving idea. We recognize of course that ChiComs, and perhaps
                            DRV, may be as interested in sabotaging a conference on Laos as one on
                            Cambodia. (Of course <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> did favor Laos
                            conference in communiqué with Soviets, but even adverse attitudes would
                            not be completely negative factor.)</p>
                        <p>There is still a need from our point of view to keep some sort of
                            diplomatic track open in Southeast Asia. Laos conference would be an
                            attractive vehicle in some ways for doing this. We would be on a much
                            better wicket substantively than in the Cambodian conference and should
                            be able to press effectively for full implementation of the 1962 Accords
                            by the Communists. A second advantage would be that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s expected firmness
                            regarding the composition of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            delegation at such a conference might make it more difficult for Commies
                            to press for representation of NFLSVN. In any case <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> as principal interested party would
                            certainly itself oppose Front representation.</p>
                        <p>At same time we sense from Souvanna's ready agreement to Cambodian
                            conference and from Laotian situation and his attitude generally that
                            Laotian conference would be manageable for him domestically. Specific
                            condition of neutralizing <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> might well
                            not be necessary now in view consolidated <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> hold on compensating areas—though of course <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and we could point to Communist
                            aggression in <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> as one matter
                            requiring redress.</p>
                        <p>Similarly for <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>, it would appear from reactions to
                            Cambodian conference that US interest in Laos conference would not in
                            present circumstances be taken as sign of weakness.</p>
                        <p>In short it would appear that we have good deal to gain and little or
                            nothing to lose by encouraging conference on Laos at this time, either
                            through Article 19 route or otherwise. If Communists block meeting, we
                            have scored significant propaganda point. If meeting takes place, we are
                            in sound position to push for implementation of 1962 Accords and to <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0397"/>profit by any Communist
                            interest in corridor talks on Vietnam which might develop.</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate thoughts of addressees on the above.<note n="2" xml:id="d181fn2">The Embassy in Bangkok vigorously opposed a Laos

                        </p>
                        <p>We have come a long way from the day when our only transgression of the
                            1962 Geneva Accords was the covert direction of Air America operations.
                            We now conduct an average of fifty combat air sorties daily by U.S.
                            aircraft against targets on Laos territory; we maintain, encadre, and
                            direct a clandestine guerrilla force of 20,000 men which inflicts daily
                            casualties <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0398"/>on the enemy; we
                            have installed, we supply, and we advise a Thai artillery battalion at a
                            critical point on Laos soil; we operate a fleet of about fifty aircraft
                            primarily engaged in paramilitary activity; and we conduct a clandestine
                            military aid program here on a fifty million dollar a year scale.</p>
                        <p>We get away with all this by elaborate precautions of dissimulation,
                            tight discipline over loose talk, and a sprightly collusion with our Lao
                            hosts. However, the enemy is fully aware of what we are doing and would
                            lose no opportunity in a conference to expose us. Once we became
                            exposed, it would be inevitable that many of our activities would have
                            to be suspended. Those of us who conduct these operations harbor the
                            illusion that they are of some value to the United States and cause some
                            annoyance to our enemies. On the basis of this assumption, we require
                            scores of Americans to risk their lives every day and a few every month
                            to give their lives in an effort to carry out this program.</p>
                        <p>If we are willing to jeopardize and probably dismantle all the operations
                            listed above because of a desire to experiment with a new “diplomatic
                            track”, that is a decision which can only be made in Washington and
                            will, of course, be accepted here. However, let us not make the decision
                            on the illusory grounds that we would be more comfortable sitting in a
                            Laos conference than we would in a Cambodian conference. The oratory
                            from Cambodia might be more painful than from Laos, but the practical
                            damage to our own interests would be nil. I know from personal
                            experience in Geneva that one can get surprisingly immune to oratory,
                            particularly of the Communist variety. And I'm sure Averell <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> has been insulted by better

                            concerned about the effect which our present activities in Laos would

                                expressed was not about the “effect our activities in Laos would
                                have on a Laotian conference but rather the effect a conference
                                would have on our activities.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                                POL 27 LAOS)</note> The elementary fact is that we were in near
                            complete and meticulous compliance with the 1962 Accord whereas the
                            other side always had several thousand North Vietnamese in Laos contrary
                            to the agreements and never seriously interrupted the use of Laotian
                            corridors to South Viet-Nam contrary to the agreement. At a Laotian
                            conference what we are doing would constitute a major card to play in
                            obtaining serious compliance by the other side. Surely our posture would
                            simply be “we support the 1962 Accords, and are in favor of complete
                            supervised compliance with those accords by all parties.”</p>

                            who signed off on a circular on May 10th (attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d184fn2">It was not a circular, but a multiple addressees

                            which he concluded that since a Cambodia conference was “pretty well out
                            the window”, we might turn our attention to a Laos conference in order
                            to maintain some sort of diplomatic track in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>The responses to this cable have been fairly negative for differing
                            reasons—most cogently, because certain addressee posts disagreed that a
                            Cambodia conference was dead. Since then, as you know, the Cambodia
                            business has shown new signs of life.</p>

                            the back burner and brings the Cambodia one up forward once again.<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Circular telegram 2236, May 15. (Department

                        <p>H: Politically it would unstick the situation. I urged the whole thing be
                            dropped and concentrate on the other country or some other way of
                            getting it started. It was amazing to see the Secretary's message.<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">

                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> said something about
                            entering the picture through Article 19. It would not have anything to
                            do with the conference. He said absolutely essential there be such
                            talks. Something on a six-nation basis that gives some entrance
                            wedge.</p>
                        <p>H: I think Bill is right. We are going to get into terrible trouble. Even
                            a six-nation [conference] … the whole thing is fraught with danger. The
                            whole point is to have private conversations. This is a silly
                            performance. It would just open the door. All these facts come out; just
                            couldn't help it. What is our answer?</p>
                        <p>U: Just haven't got answer for some of the points Bill raising.</p>
                        <p>H: Cambodia thing quite different. In other [Laos conference] these facts
                            would unquestionably come out in the talks. How could you prevent it? I
                            think the whole thing is absolutely unthinkable. I have been against it.
                            Souvanna doesn't want it. It would unstick the rather tenuous situation
                            that exists. Article 19 relates to co-chairmen talk, consulting with the
                            whole range of conferees, particularly with the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> countries and the Lao themselves. We are out of that.
                            Article 19 doesn't do us any good because we want to be in place where
                            we can have corridor talks, they call them after session talks. Here
                            there would be the most violent attacks against us which we couldn't
                            answer. It's just a pipe dream. Everything they could get hold of they
                            would throw at us. I think it is just borrowing trouble.</p>

                        <p>1899. On eve Souvanna's departure for brief vacation in Thailand, I had
                            fairly detailed discussion with him re future of our bombing program in
                            Laos. I told him that our military men felt that great deal of dam <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0402"/>age could be done to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> if we
                            could make systematic attacks against their depots and storage areas. I
                            then gave him a map which we have worked up locally showing our estimate
                            of depot locations throughout <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> territory.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna, said that, in principle, he was agreed to program of
                            destroying logistics depots and wished to push ahead with planning for
                            such action. Problem, as he saw it, was fact that <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> very often used
                            civilian population centers as their principal warehouse areas,
                            deliberately seeking the protection of innocent villagers as a deterrent
                            against air raids. He said that he and members of General Staff had
                            discussed this specific problem in meeting they held day before
                            yesterday with <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> at Savannakhet. They were examining
                            ways of flushing out civilians before action began.</p>
                        <p>However, if we could (by infra-red or other means) spot areas which were
                            clearly military concentration points away from civilian population
                            centers, he would be willing see them subjected to systematic strikes.
                            He asked that I have my people discuss these matters in detail with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and General Staff. He
                            would instruct his people accordingly.</p>
                        <p>I then turned to our evaluation of probable heavy use of river
                            transportation by enemy on Nam Hou and Se Kong Rivers, and asked his
                            views re strikes against waterborne traffic. He said it was impossible
                            from the air to distinguish between a native boat and a <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> boat.
                            In fact, most boats used by <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> were merely local native boats dragooned
                            into service. He therefore could not authorize strikes against river
                            craft. He asked that we stick to land traffic portaging goods up to
                            river embarkation points.</p>
                        <p>We will follow up on this conversation in military channels locally.
                            Would welcome comments or suggestions from addressees.</p>

                        <p>2054. In company with Air Attaché, I spent all day Sunday with <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> Commander General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>. He first viewed with us (at his
                            Savannakhet Headquarters) action which he has undertaken in course past
                            month meticulously tracing out routes which he believes <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> is using to support 325th Division now
                            located south of 17th parallel. This has involved literally hundreds of
                            sorties, flown mostly at tree-top level, to determine roads, waystations
                            and truck parks. He now believes he has a fairly good fix on two
                            principal routes, generally moving eastward from Muong Nong (XD 6110) to
                            the <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> frontier. He has occasionally
                            flushed out convoys on these routes and has succeeded in destroying
                            several trucks.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, all our Yankee Team photo recce missions over this area
                            have failed to turn up a decent trace of a recognizable route. Moreover,
                            there have been two occasions during past week when General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> has called for U.S. jet strikes
                            (Bango mission) on these routes and jets, upon arrival at scene, have
                            not been able to find the road, or their target. In part, this has been
                            due to dicey weather, but in even greater measure, it has, I am sure,
                            been due to impenetrable tree canopy which high speed, high flying jets
                            literally can not see through.</p>
                        <p>In order to demonstrate significance this latter point General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and Colonel <persName corresp="#p_NC1">Nouphet</persName>, commanding <gloss target="#t_GM1">GM</gloss> 18, took us by helicopter to some forward
                            territory recently captured from Pathet Lao, which straddles a section
                            of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Both Air Attaché and I, despite our several
                            years experience in this part of the world, were astounded by what we
                            found. The “trail,” even in this rainy season, was a thoroughly passable
                            road. We drove two jeeps over it for more than a mile. It would have
                            easily accommodated 4x4 trucks.</p>
                        <p>Yet nowhere on this road, except for two very limited areas, was it open
                            to the sky. Even flying over it slowly with a helicopter, road was not
                            discernible from above. Air Attaché took several photographs
                            demonstrating canopy which he will submit through his channels.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear to me, from this experience, that significant quantities
                            of logistics can still be moving over routes which General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and his men have so meticulously
                            plotted out for us but which our strike aircraft <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0404"/>are unable to discern. This obviously
                            poses a number of military problems, but it also involves some fairly
                            basic political decisions. Among them are questions of massive
                            employment of defoliants, bombing on infra-red rather than visual
                            controls, using saturation bombing tactics to create major choke points,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>Any decisions on these matters, I realize, will require Washington
                            discussion at high levels, and will doubtless demand more detailed
                            information than I have provided in this message. By same token, if
                            Souvanna sticks to original Algiers schedule, he will be leaving here
                            tomorrow morning and will, in any event, be leaving in near future. I
                            have undertaken no significant military departures since I have been
                            here without full and frank discussion with Souvanna. This is, in my
                            opinion, sound practice both with respect U.S. and <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> interests. Therefore, if there is to be
                            any Washington inclination to move toward tactics suggested in preceding
                            paragraph, I believe I should have some guidelines soonest, so that I
                            can at least be prepared to discuss this matter in principle with Prime
                            Minister before his imminent departure.<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">The

                        <p>You will recall that the Soviet airlift, begun in December 1960 to
                                neutralist/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces, was terminated
                            in October–November 1962. The Soviets <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0405"/>withdrew from the scene, transferring most of their
                            transport aircraft involved in the airlift to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. We have had no reports of any covert
                            Soviet air activity over Laos since that time.</p>
                        <p>From time to time since the fall of 1962, we have received low-level
                            reports regarding isolated unidentified transport-type aircraft
                            overflying Laos. However, there had been no reliable intelligence that
                            the enemy was conducting air resupply of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN forces on any kind of regular basis until early
                            April 1965.</p>
                        <p>Starting in early April, we have been receiving an increasing number of
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> reports strongly suggesting that
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN forces in the Xieng
                            Khouang/Sam Neua area are receiving supplies by air drop. (On one
                            occasion two transport-type aircraft were observed on Sam Neua
                            airfield.) Embassy Vientiane has reported that on the basis of reports
                            from ground observers (the above <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            reports) and other intelligence (presumably including radar trackings by
                            Udorn) there now appears to be a more or less regular pattern of air
                            resupply activity taking place during twilight hours in the Xieng
                            Khouang/Sam Neua area and involving at least 1–2 unidentified transport
                            aircraft on most occasions.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the first reports in early April, we informed Vientiane
                            that higher authority had directed that US forces intercept and destroy
                            hostile aircraft engaged in the air resupply of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN forces in northern Laos. In view of the obvious
                            political and other risks involved, the instructions cautioned that any
                            intercept effort should be based on reliable intelligence that the
                            aircraft was or were in fact hostile and engaged in air resupply. Hot
                            pursuit into NVN was also authorized, as necessary.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador was also instructed to consult <persName>Prince</persName>
                            Souvanna. Souvanna, after considerable deliberation, agreed in principle
                            that we should attempt to intercept and destroy any hostile aircraft
                            engaged in air resupply but indicated this should be done only in
                            flagrante with full assurance that the aircraft was parachuting or
                            dropping supplies to the enemy. Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> acknowledged that this operation would be
                            tricky.</p>
                        <p>To date there has been no intercept attempt. Second Air Division has now
                            concluded, and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> concurs,
                            that intercept operations are not justified since the probability of
                            success is reduced as a result of the need to limit the hours during
                            which an intercept attempt can be made. This is in order to permit
                            normal Air America and other resupply activities in the area to take
                            place without interruption.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> now proposes
                            that two <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> T–28's with AA pilots,
                            and three <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> ground support
                            personnel, be repositioned on alert at Site 98<note n="2" xml:id="d188fn2">Site 98 was Long Thienh (Chien), Meo (Hmong) leader
                                Vang Pao's headquarters.</note> to accomplish the intercept mission
                                (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 2079).<note n="3" xml:id="d188fn3">Dated June 25. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            requested our approval. We recommend that this proposal be disapproved.
                            We are already stretching our luck, it seems to us, in using AA pilots
                            on T–28's on <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> missions. So far our
                            luck has held out but we question the desirability of running the added
                            risks involved in intercept missions. We assume Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> did not suggest the use of Lao
                            or Thai pilots because of the problems of positive identification that
                            the aircraft is hostile and engaged in flagrante in air resupply (and
                            not one of ours), and the language barrier (the <gloss target="#t_AOC1">AOC</gloss> Vientiane would make the final identification
                            decision).</p>
                        <p>In view of the earlier personal involvement of the President in directing
                            that these hostile aircraft be intercepted and destroyed, perhaps we
                            should explore the possibility of using Lao or Thai pilots on T–28's for
                            this mission before deciding to cancel this project. There should be at
                            least two pilots whom our people know well enough to have confidence in
                            their pilot proficiency, judgment and reliability. They could be given
                            intensive aircraft identification indoctrination. The language problem
                            could be overcome by having an interpreter at the <gloss target="#t_AOC1">AOC</gloss> to pass the final authorization, etc.
                            It is possible that the need to use Site 98 may make this suggestion
                            impractical. However, we think it is worth putting to Vientiane.
                            Otherwise we recommend that Project “Duck Soup” be dropped.<note n="4" xml:id="d188fn4">

                                stated it was not prepared to run the risk of having Air America or

                                except for search and rescue operations. The Department suggested
                                that the Embassy explore the possibility of using specially trained
                                Lao or Thai pilots for Operation Duck Soup. (Ibid.)</note>

                            son intended join him in New Delhi to proceed Vientiane.</p>
                        <p>Main points of conversation:</p>
                        <p>1. I expressed our admiration for leadership and courage shown by
                                <persName>Prince</persName> in dealing with difficult problems faced
                            by his country and assured him continued support and cooperation of U.S.
                            in difficult task preserving Laos independence. Added that we respected
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military effort and particularly
                            performance of officer cadets in defeating <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/DRVN attacks. <persName>Prince</persName> expressed
                            appreciation for U.S. support and indicated his determination to
                            continue on same course.</p>
                        <p>2. I stressed our continued support for 1962 Geneva Agreements and noted
                            importance <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> maintaining strong
                            position by making clear responsibility for any breach lay with <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and Communist side.
                                <persName>Prince</persName> fully agreed noting that after coming
                            elections he intended reappoint <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            ministers to their present posts, knowing of course they would not
                            occupy them. In this connection, <persName>Prince</persName> said that
                            every effort must be made not to embarrass Soviets and to make it easier
                            for them to support <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, with which I
                            expressed full agreement.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName>Prince</persName> said he attached great importance to
                            persuading <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, as co-chairmen 1962 agreements, to
                            reconvene the conference of 1954. He noted that this much more
                            satisfactory to him than reconvening conference on 1962 agreements since
                            he had laid down a prior condition to latter, namely, that all <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> troops be withdrawn from the Plaine des
                            Jarres; reconvening 1954 conference would permit participation Laos
                            without fulfillment such precondition and would permit discussion of any
                            aspect problems of three countries former Indochina. He said he had <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0408"/>expressed his desire that 1954
                            conference be reconvened to Soviet and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            Ambassadors prior his departure to Vientiane and they had referred to
                            govts. He intended press matter both in London and Moscow during
                            upcoming visits. I assured him such proposal had our full support but
                            stressed importance his presenting idea purely as his own.
                                <persName>Prince</persName> indicated full agreement and
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>4. On Viet Nam, I pointed out President had made clear willingness have
                            discussions without preconditions but in light Communist rejection all
                            proposals for talks, determination to continue defend South Viet Nam
                            including bombing. <persName>Prince</persName> replied he happy our
                            policy in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> so firm and agreed bombing
                            should continue, noting that bombing of routes from North Viet Nam into
                            Laos had already made it impossible for Communists to launch planned
                            spring offensive and permitted <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            establish control in large areas.</p>
                        <p>5. Indicating I assumed <persName>Prince</persName> would continue head
                            government for some time even beyond the five years he had undertaken, I
                            asked if younger men were being developed and showing promise. In reply
                            he stated only that he thought <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> showed greatest promise among younger men. In
                            this connection, it was noted that all <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> ministers would be back in Vientiane for elections.</p>
                        <p>6. Referring to President's <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>

                                Documents, 1965, pp. 696–698.</note> I said we hoped
                                <persName>Prince</persName> would show active interest in such
                            program as it must have broad Asian sponsorship.
                                <persName>Prince</persName> replied he thought establishment of
                            Asian Bank highly important and that he would of course support all
                            development efforts in area. He indicated particular interest in Nam
                            Ngum Dam project, noting with appreciation that he understood U.S.
                            expert had just recommended planning capacity should be increased to
                            80,000 kw and that U.S. support be augmented; added he thought we wise
                            to try to obtain participation as many other countries as possible in
                            development Laos and SEA. In this connection, he said he intended ask
                            Soviets in Moscow to contribute to program, pointing out that <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> supported Soviets claim to be Asian
                            power and that Soviets should prove they truly Asian by supporting
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> development. I assured him we
                            would welcome Soviet participation in this effort.</p>
                        <p>7. With particular reference India, <persName>Prince</persName> said he
                            disappointed in their performance as far back as first Bandung
                            conference when Nehru showed he dominated by Chou En-lai; he still
                            disappointed but considered it essential India remain as Chairman <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> and that it adopt more realistic
                            attitude toward Asian problems. I commented that we were helping Indian
                            military build-up against possible future ChiCom ag <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0409"/>gression but we concerned that Shastri,

                            privately, publicly called for cessation our bombardments; said I
                            thought Indians might be better advised to call for cessation of
                            hostilities by both sides. <persName>Prince</persName> said
                            disappointment with India had led him make strong effort increase roles
                            both Soviets and Japan in this area.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>Strong coup rumors with more than the usual substance are again
                            circulating in Laos; a move is reportedly planned prior to the National
                            Assembly election on July 18. Several key military and civilian figures
                            are said to be involved, including Air Force Chief General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>, second military region commander
                            General <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> (the Meo leader),
                            and possibly neutralist leader <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong
                                Le</persName>. The reason for their unrest is the increasing
                            military and political dominance of the
                                <persName>Sananikone</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> faction in Vientiane. They charge this
                            faction with neglecting the legitimate needs of military commands
                            outside the capital, flagrant misappropriation of U.S. aid, and a
                            failure to prosecute a vigorous campaign <pb n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0410"/>against the Pathet Lao. They also decry Souvanna's lack
                            of energetic leadership.</p>
                        <p>The coup group reportedly plans to depose Souvanna while he is in Europe,
                            relieve key Vientiane-based generals from their General Staff positions,
                            initially establish military committee rule, and invite a representative
                            of the Royal Family to lead the government.</p>
                        <p>The coup rumors reflect the continuing family and factional rivalries
                            which have long plagued Laotian politics. The chances for a successful
                            coup depend upon a number of variables, the cohesiveness of the plotters
                            and the loyalties of commanders and units. Of critical importance, as it
                            has been in the past, will be the degree and timeliness of U.S. pressure
                            upon the disaffected leaders, as well as simultaneous efforts to
                            persuade the Vientiane group to open up the supply channels to the
                            provinces and to permit non-Vientiane elements (notably General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>) a greater role in the
                            military establishment. Some of these pressures, specifically
                            reaffirmation of full U.S. support for Souvanna, are being brought to
                            bear. Should these pressures fail the combined forces of the dissidents,
                            backed by General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>'s T–28's,
                            could pose a formidable threat to the Vientiane forces.</p>

                                    Barbis</persName>, The Director, Mr. FitzGerald, Mr. DeSilva,
                                Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName>
                            </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. After a preliminary discussion, the Director outlined his plans to
                            augment <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s effort in Southeast Asia
                            as a whole and his assignment of Mr. DeSilva as a Special Assistant for
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stated that
                            Laos is handled as a part of the Southeast Asia total problem through
                            the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meetings and <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0411"/>through exchanging intel. He
                            then outlined his own thinking that Laos is a holding operation whose
                            future depends upon South Vietnam. However, he pointed out that the two
                            areas must be treated differently, both publicly and in the style of
                            operations. He pointed out that most American operations in Laos are
                            clandestine in nature and that no admission is made of American
                            participation. Mr. FitzGerald mentioned the possibilities of more formal
                            and overt U.S. military activity as a result of alleged “intelligence
                            gaps” appearing in South Laos. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> said he was aware of this but that it is his
                            intention to carry on along his basic line. He particularly pointed out
                            the problem of defining what is meant by “interdiction”, which would
                            call for large numbers of troops, and “harassment” which would probably
                            end our intelligence coverage. He indicated that the same problem arises
                            over the military's ideas as to operations into the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. His line there was that it would be
                            immoral to encourage “resistance” of any size in the DRV if we were not
                            willing to follow it up and support it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> indicated that we had some problems in carrying
                            out the intelligence operations authorized by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> if we were not able to develop
                            at least a popular base of opinion and some armament to protect the
                            teams. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> was
                            not convinced of this and maintained his position that the intelligence
                            effort should be handled as a small team effort only. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> indicated that he
                            was prepared to encourage the use of overt U.S. or Vietnamese force
                            Westwards along Route 9, gradually extending the <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> border, while publicly denying that the troops were in
                            Laos, all the way to Tchepone if necessary. On the other hand, he said
                            that the use of Thai rangers in this area as suggested by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> seemed to him
                            impractical as they would inevitably be too overt and too well
                            known.</p>
                        <p>3. On the political side Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> indicated some satisfaction with the situation
                            in that the “corrupt gang” around <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> is out and Souvanna had developed an heir

                            intending to increase its effort in the Southeast Asian area but that he
                            was convinced that the problem there must be approached from a total
                            point of view rather than as specific and limited items. He told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that he was
                            recommending establishment of a national planning task group to carry

                        <p rend="center">Scope Note</p>
                        <p>Laos continues to lie as a secondary theater in the shadow of Vietnam.
                            This estimate surveys the local Lao scene and evaluates the prospects
                            for serious trouble arising from local political or military
                            developments during the next few months. Extension of major ground
                            operations of the Vietnam conflict into Lao territory would, of course,
                            create a fundamentally new situation.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Summary</p>
                        <p>A. During the next month or so, the formation of a new government will
                            create a period of some tension in Vientiane and will present problems
                            in relations with the Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>).
                            Although the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> will launch propaganda
                            attacks on any new arrangements made as a result of the recent
                            elections, we believe the chances are better than even that they will
                            not set up a rival government. Considering the characteristic volatility
                            of Lao politics, a coup is an ever-present possibility, but we see no
                            major threat at this time to Souvanna's continuance in office.</p>
                        <p>B. Whereas we are fairly confident in our judgment that the Communists
                            probably do not intend to initiate any major military action in Laos in
                            the next few months, we are certain that they would react vigorously to
                            any offensive in Laos which they felt seriously threatened the
                            infiltration route to the Viet Cong or moved into the territories
                            bordering on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Communist
                            China. Despite some improvement in the Lao army in the past year or so,
                            we believe that any major Lao offensive into these sensitive areas would
                            be repulsed with great damage and a severe setback to general military
                            morale.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Political Situation and Prospects</p>
                        <p>1. In 1962, the neutralist <persName>Prince</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> was made premier
                            of the tripartite regime established as a result of the 14-nation
                            conference <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0413"/>at Geneva. Two
                            deputy premiers, <persName>Prince</persName>
                            <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi Nosavan</persName>, represented
                            the pro-Communist and rightist factions respectively. Pro-Communist
                            participation in the government practically ended in the spring of 1963
                            when Prince <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> and one of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> ministers left Vientiane for Communist territory.
                            Although some cabinet posts are still held open for the pro-Communists,
                            the government has since been in effect a neutralist-rightist coalition,
                            with rightist influence growing. Souvanna himself has become
                            increasingly anti-Communist.</p>
                        <p>2. The flight of <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi Nosavan</persName>
                            from Laos after his attempted coup last February eliminated one
                            important source of political instability and strengthened <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s position. Souvanna
                            has some degree of backing from most of the non-Communist political
                            factions in Laos. The King has supported him increasingly, and even such
                            powerful conservatives as the <persName>Sananikone</persName> family,
                            whose position was also strengthened by <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s departure, have been generally content to work
                            with him as premier. Most Lao politicians consider it useful to continue
                            him in office because he symbolizes the Geneva legitimacy of the Lao
                            Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>). Nevertheless,
                            dissensions among military leaders, although more related to rivalries
                            between the general staff and the field officers than to Souvanna's
                            role, could erupt in a manner that would threaten or destroy
                            stability.</p>
                        <p>3. Although Souvanna keeps tight control of foreign affairs and has
                            increased his command of the sources of power in the government
                            (patronage and money), he has tended to leave a large part of the
                            everyday management of government affairs to others. A number of
                            relatively young civil servants and junior cabinet officers have
                            recently come into prominence, of whom the most important is <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk na Champassak</persName>. By Lao standards
                            they are a hard-working and generally honest group. A few have already
                            been accused of lining their pockets, however, and we cannot be
                            confident that increased authority or frustration will not incline them
                            toward the corrupt ways of their elders. Souvanna has been promoting the
                            cause of <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> in a way that
                            indicates he sees him as a possible successor to the premiership, but,
                            as <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> himself recognizes, he
                            has not yet acquired the necessary maturity and prestige for that
                            difficult job.</p>
                        <p>4. The approach of the National Assembly elections of 18 July stimulated
                            some uncertainty and considerable activity, including threats and
                            bribery, among the various factions, for whom seats in this largely
                            rubber-stamp body represent at least accretions of prestige and
                            political influence. The electorate, restricted to about 20,000 military
                            officers, government functionaries, and teachers returned an Assembly
                            generally younger and more energetic and capable than its predecessor
                            and one accordingly that is likely to seek a more active role in the
                            government.</p>
                        <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>5. The outcome of the election was favorable for the preservation of
                            stability. No group won such complete dominance that others would feel
                            driven to overthrow it, and no group was so badly defeated that it would
                            feel a coup was required for self-preservation. On the whole, the chief
                            gainers were the “Young Nationalists,” who line up with <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk na Champassak</persName>. Since the election
                            enough of the successful candidates have gravitated to <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> to give him a majority, which he
                            can be expected to use in support of Souvanna. The chief losers were the
                                <persName>Sananikone</persName> family, but even they won about 10
                            of the 50 seats. The leading Sananikones, former Premier <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName>, and his nephew, General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, commander of the military
                            region which includes Vientiane, have both expressed satisfaction with
                            the outcome.</p>
                        <p>6. During the election campaign, rumors of coups were rife in Vientiane.
                                [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            There will always be a threat to stability, however, as long as command
                            relationships remain in contention and distrust persists among the
                            military leaders, particularly between Vientiane and the field
                            commanders. However, we believe the chances are better than even that
                            the legal government will survive these dangers and that Souvanna will
                            continue as premier.</p>
                        <p>7. The ambitious General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>,
                            now in exile in Thailand, poses little present threat. Although he still
                            retains some following, particularly among middle ranks in the military,
                            he has little chance of recouping his position as long as the present
                            balance prevails in Laos. His diminished standing with the Thai was
                            further lowered by his ill advised play for power early this year; the
                            Thai leaders are willing to let him remain in Thailand as a refugee, but
                            they almost certainly have no intention of backing <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> in an attempt to return to power.
                            Although the Thai leaders do not much care for some of the present Lao
                            leaders, they are willing to accept them or any other non-leftist group
                            that appears able to provide a modicum of stability in a non-Communist
                            Laos. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> would remain
                            available for the Thai to back should the situation in Vientiane
                            collapse into chaos.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Military Situation and Prospects</p>
                        <p>8. At present the Lao Government forces (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>) have about 54,000 men (including about 1,000 in the
                            Air Force and 450 in the River Flotilla). The Royal Lao Air Force
                                (<gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>), under the leadership of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>, has available about 45
                            propeller-driven fighter-bombers (T–28s), and its pilots have shown
                            commendable courage and skill in close air support action and in
                            harassing enemy movements and supply. Last summer's successful clearing
                            operation around the junction of routes 7 and 13, this spring's
                            successful defense of Dong Hene against an attack by North Vietnamese
                            troops, the absence of a Communist offensive before this year's monsoon,
                            and, perhaps most important, the increased ground attack capability of
                            the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> (plus US air action in Laos)
                            have combined to <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0415"/>give the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> improved morale and confidence.
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> capabilities are probably the
                            best they have been, but this still leaves it as a third-rate fighting
                            force with little capability against determined opposition.</p>
                        <p>9. A significant element on the anti-Communist side is the large number
                            of tribal irregulars who continue to put up vigorous defense of their
                            mountain-top home areas and have provided some effective harassment of
                            enemy supply lines. The neutralist forces commanded by General <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> should also be counted on the
                            anti-Communist side, but these largely demoralized 8,000 or so men have
                            a very limited military capability.</p>
                        <p>10. The Communist forces in Laos are estimated to include about
                            22,000–25,000 Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>) and about
                            9,000 North Vietnamese troops (<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>),

                                substantially reduced <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces
                                in Laos to lessen the monsoon supply problem, and it may have done
                                so this year. The 9,000 figure does not take into account this
                                possible reduction; neither does it take into account <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> troops in transit through Laos
                                into Vietnam. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> There are also
                            about 2,600 rather ineffectual dissident neutralists under the commands
                            of Colonel Deuane and General Khamouane Boupha. The Deuanists, like
                            their counterparts under <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>,
                            are of wavering loyalty, even though encadred with <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>. It is unlikely that there are any
                            organized Chinese military units in Laos, although detachments of armed
                            guards have probably at times accompanied Chinese road-building crews
                            and supply convoys in Phong Saly and Nam Tha provinces.</p>
                        <p>11. The Communist forces—particularly the <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>—are generally more effective than the non-Communist
                            Lao forces and retain the capability of rapidly seizing such exposed
                            places as Thakhek or Luang Prabang. The interior southern towns of
                            Saravane and Attopeu are especially vulnerable to Communist attack and
                            could be seized by small forces. They could not overrun <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>-held territory quite so swiftly and
                            easily as they might have in the past, however, because of the
                            improvement of the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and especially
                            because of the effect of air attack on their forces and supply lines.
                            Seizure of Vientiane, Pakse, or Savannakhet would almost certainly
                            require the introduction of substantial additional <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>12. The Communists give no sign of wanting to stir up the military
                            situation in Laos. They already control those parts of Laos which are
                            most important to them: the areas adjacent to China and North Vietnam
                            and the part of the panhandle used as a supply and infiltration route
                            into South Vietnam. Not since 1962 have they moved to take an important
                            town from the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>, and this year they
                            have even passed up the usual pre-monsoon offensive against the
                            neutralists. They have conducted some fairly vigorous clearing actions
                            against the anti-Communist irregulars <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0416"/>along their supply lines in Sam Neua province, and they
                            are currently increasing pressure on the anti-Communist irregulars in
                            the region where Luang Prabang, Phong Saly, and Nam Tha provinces come
                            together. These efforts have resulted in some improvement of the
                            security of their supply lines, but much of the rugged country outside
                            the roads and strong points remains in the hands of the tribal
                            irregulars. The results have shown that Communists also find it
                            difficult and costly to suppress guerrillas. In addition, air action has
                            complicated their supply problem and lowered morale.</p>
                        <p>13. Whereas we are fairly confident in our judgment that the Communists
                            probably do not intend to initiate any major military action in Laos in
                            the next few months, we are certain that they would react vigorously to
                            any offensive in Laos which they felt seriously threatened the
                            infiltration route to the Viet Cong or moved into the territories
                            bordering on the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Communist
                            China. Any <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> offensive into these
                            sensitive areas would be repulsed with great damage to the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> forces involved and a severe setback to
                            general <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> morale.</p>

                            Staff, indicated concurrence with the concept for cross-border
                            operations and initiation of Phase I, subject to the following
                            modifications:</p>
                        <p>a. Initial introduction of teams accompanied by US advisors into Laos to
                            be by ground infiltration.</p>
                        <p>b. Subsequent resupply, reinforcement, or evacuation by air from South
                            Vietnam to be permitted.</p>
                        <p>c. Air strikes on possible targets developed to be flown as approved and
                            conducted through the Bango system only, not to include strike aircraft
                            from South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>d. Elimination of the ten-day restriction on the length of stay.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) With regard to subparagraph 2 c,
                            above, air strikes on targets developed by cross-border teams would be
                            conducted through the Bango alert system, which employs strip alert US
                            aircraft based in Thailand. This system requires that air strike
                            requests be passed to the Air Support Operations Center (<gloss target="#t_ASOC1">ASOC</gloss>), Udorn, and thence to the Air
                            Attache (<gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss>), Vientiane, for
                            approval. Upon approval, attack aircraft are scrambled from Ubon and a
                            T–28 air coordinator from Udorn. If the aircraft in Ubon are
                            unavailable, the Bango system draws on Whiplash aircraft at Korat and
                            Takli, which are up to 380 nautical miles from the target area. The
                            original concept envisioned that all strike requests would be passed
                            immediately to an <gloss target="#t_ASOC1">ASOC</gloss> in the RVN. The
                                <gloss target="#t_ASOC1">ASOC</gloss> would launch A–1 aircraft on
                            ground alert at RVN bases less than 90 miles from the target area. An
                            air coordinator would not be required and US team members trained as
                            Forward Air Controllers would control air strikes. <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> has pointed out problem
                            areas involved in using the Bango system for this particular operation.
                            However, in the interest of obtaining early approval to initiate
                            operations, <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> recommend acceptance of the
                            Bango system with necessary adjustments to be made if the responsiveness
                            of the system is not satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, on 27 July 1965, recommended acceptance of the
                            other modifications listed in paragraph 2, above, for initiation of
                            Phase I operations.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Costs incident to <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 cross-border funding requirements
                            have been refined by <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>a. Dollar funding requirement—$191,000.</p>
                        <p>(1) Individual equipment for approximately 80 personnel— $20,000.</p>
                        <p>(2) Organizational equipment including communications— $100,000.</p>
                        <p>(3) Personnel and organizational equipment replacement and additional
                            communication requirements—$25,000.</p>
                        <p>(4) TDY funds to support US augmentation personnel—$46,000.</p>
                        <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0418"/>
                        <p>b. Piastre funding requirements totaling $125,000 will be made available
                            through <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> approved budget.</p>
                        <p>c. If special paramilitary forces are required for subsequent operations
                            visualized for Phases II and III, additional funds will be required.</p>
                        <p>6. (TS) The Joint Chiefs of Staff are of the view that <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 costs for specialized equipments and
                            support of indigenous personnel which cannot be allocated through normal
                            timely mechanisms be provided from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            contingency funds. In this connection, responsibility for planning and
                            conducting cross-border operations has been assigned by <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> to the Military Assistance
                            Command Studies and Observation Group which currently is responsible for
                            OPLAN 34A operations against the NVN. Therefore, the funding mechanism
                            developed for cross-border forces should be additive or compatible to
                            that utilized for OPLAN 34A, in order to avoid layering two methods of
                            accountability on the field agency responsible for operations. Further,
                            with regard to the <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            estimate for TDY funds to support US augmentation personnel
                            ($46,000—item 5a(4), above), it is considered that such costs should be
                            borne by the Services involved as a normal obligation as in the case of
                            other TDY personnel ordered to forward stations. Therefore, the dollar
                            funding requirement summarized in paragraph 5, above, for <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966 DOD contingency funds should be
                            $145,000.</p>
                        <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff recommend, in lieu of paragraph 8 of JCSM–475–65, that:</p>
                        <p>a. The cross-border concept contained in JCSM–475–65, as modified by
                            paragraph 2, above, be approved.</p>
                        <p>b. Phase I, as modified by paragraph 2, above, be approved for
                            execution.</p>

                            operations in the amount of $145,000 be funded from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> contingency funds in a manner similar
                            to that employed for OPLAN 34A funding.</p>

                        <p>142. 1. During my recent peregrinations in Saigon, Washington, Honolulu
                            and Bangkok, I had numerous discussions with interested officials
                            concerning Lao corridor. Because these talks covered various aspects of
                            the problem at various stops, I consider it might be useful to record in
                            one message the view which I have expressed orally.</p>
                        <p>2. First of apb, [all?] I have indicated some concern that we define our
                            objectives as best we can in the various categories of interdiction,
                            harassment and intelligence. Any actions we would intend to take towards
                            any one of these ultimate objectives will have its effect on each of the
                            other two.</p>
                        <p>3. Starting with interdiction, which would be the ideal end result, I
                            think it has to be conceded from the start that we do not have adequate
                            resources in Laos to accomplish true interdiction against a determined
                            Viet Minh effort to keep the corridor open. Similarly, it is most
                            improbable that we could interdict by air action alone. Therefore, if we
                            really intend to interdict, we have to think in terms of large numbers
                            of ground forces moving into Lao territory from Vietnam in order to
                            occupy the terrain. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            estimated these numbers at approximately two U.S. divisions.</p>
                        <p>4. In considering such an enterprise, the probable military results have
                            to be measured against the predictable political costs. These costs,
                            which would involve the overt violation of the 1962 agreements on Laos,
                            would involve far more than just a question of principle. There would be
                            very real practical consequences as well. These could develop in either
                            of two directions:</p>
                        <p>A. Our invasion would have to be done contrary to Souvanna's wishes.
                            (This would be most likely circumstance.) In this case, we would have to
                            decide to defy him, to establish a puppet government with military
                            backing, and take the consequences. In effect, we would have to repeat
                            the 1961 scenario. It is doubtful that the outcome would be any more
                            satisfactory this time around.</p>
                        <p>B. Our action could be undertaken with Souvanna's blessing but at the
                            price of assuring him protection by U.S. resources against the
                            consequent Viet Minh reaction. This would engage considerable numbers of
                            U.S. and probably Thai forces to protect the Mekong River Valley and
                            associated areas of Laos. In short, we could not confine our Laotian
                            military undertaking to the corridor alone.</p>
                        <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0420"/>
                        <p>5. I encountered no strong disposition, at any of my stops, to propose
                            interdictory action at the political and military costs outlined above.
                            I also found a general understanding that, in greater or less degree,
                            these same considerations applied to all measures proposed against the
                            corridor which entailed overt, conspicuous violation of Lao territory
                            and the 1962 agreements. Thus, certain of the contingency plans
                            discussed under agenda item 1 (c) of the most recent <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d194fn2">Apparent reference to the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting of July 23–24
                                held at Bangkok. Item C discussed at this meeting was plans
                                presented by COMUSMACTHAI for Thai/U.S. Special Forces operations in
                                the Laos corridor. At the meeting it was agreed that the planning
                                should go forward on a stand-by basis even if it proved unnecessary
                                to use the forces. (Telegram 149 from Bangkok, July 24; ibid., DEF 1
                                ASIA SE)</note> which would involve forces that could not, because
                            of their nature and numbers, remain clandestine, have to be measured in
                            this same general scale of military results versus political costs.</p>
                        <p>6. This brings us to harassment. It will be recognized that we already
                            engage in some harassment against the corridor. This is in the form of
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> air action, Steel Tiger,
                            Bango/Whiplash, and finally the clandestine SGU operations on the
                            ground. We are attempting to enhance all of these, and, given certain
                            technical breakthroughs, ought to be able to be more effective,
                            particularly with our air actions. We should not overlook the
                            possibility of more effective exploitation of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>'s potential in the southern corridor area, the
                            provinces of Attopeu and Saravane. We have certain advantages here,
                            including a competent commander, which should permit some modest
                            advances along the fringes of the corridor, giving us better jumping-off
                            bases for intelligence and harassment.</p>
                        <p>7. A special case in point is Shining Brass. I had useful talks both in
                            Saigon and Honolulu on this subject. Colonel Blackburn, the new <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss> Chief, has a very realistic approach to
                            this enterprise and is quite willing to try a start under the ground
                            rules now in effect. In comment on these ground rules, I should like to
                            stress that these are intended to fix practical operating conditions
                            which minimize the risk of a large political ruckus, but which will
                            provide an experience factor against which we can explore modifications
                            as time goes on.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, in Saigon, we agreed that <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss>
                            would begin its operations by overland penetration in the two authorized
                            areas, using small teams accompanied by U.S. personnel. Although I have
                            no reason, from Vientiane perspective, to insist on ten day limit for
                            operations, Colonel Blackburn seemed to feel that was reasonable from
                            viewpoint human endurance in this terrain. If he wishes extend that
                            period, I would not object.</p>
                        <p>As for air support, I would naturally concur in emergency extraction by
                            air if the team were in trouble. It seems to me that this would fall <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0421"/>into category of <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> effort. On aerial resupply, this would
                            seem to be one of the matters where experience factor should be
                            examined, especially in determining whether teams wish to jeopardize the
                            secrecy of their locations by conspicuous airlifts. With respect air
                            strikes, these can be accomplished with Bango/Whiplash framework if
                            strikes are really desired. It is important that we use this procedure
                            in order to have effective double check against possibility striking
                            other friendly clandestine units operating in corridor under Vientiane
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Finally, on question aerial introduction of teams, I continue negative
                            insofar as it concerns initial penetration. Nothing could be more
                            reckless than to drop some boys (a la Leaping Lena) into an unknown area
                            where they are almost certain to be caught. Whether we would ultimately
                            wish rotate personnel by air is question on which I feel we should again
                            reserve judgment, as in case aerial resupply, until experience factors
                            can be measured.</p>
                        <p>In short, I feel the most fruitful course of action on Shining Brass is
                            to begin modestly under rules currently approved and then examine the
                            operations as they proceed to determine where and how they can be
                            successfully improved.</p>
                        <p>8. This brings us to intelligence, and especially to the inherent
                            conflict between harassment actions and intelligence efforts. It has
                            been our experience that, whenever we convert some of our passive
                            intelligence assets into positive harassment teams, we produce a
                            reaction which eventually degrades our intelligence capabilities. For
                            example, when a guerilla team, based on intelligence supplied by one of
                            our road watch teams, conducts a harassment, the Viets invariably react
                            by launching a sweep which clears all of our road watch teams off that
                            section of the road.</p>
                        <p>This relationship is one which will have to be examined in the conduct of
                            all our operations in the corridor. I discussed it with General Carroll,
                            during his recent visit, and with Admiral Sharp at Honolulu. It will
                            have particular pertinence to Shining Brass and will, in large measure,
                            determine operational features of that program. Similarly, with our SGU
                            teams, our Kha assets, and other in-country efforts, objectives have to
                            be fixed in the light of this equation.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, there is the question of the degree to which the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> should be or would wish to be privy to
                            all our activity. Much of what we are now doing in the corridor is known
                            only in vague outline to Souvanna and I'm sure he prefers it that way.
                            Some of our future operations may involve such political risk that it
                            would be prudent to have fairly clear understandings with Souvanna. This
                            is something else we'll have to keep under constant examination.</p>
                        <p>10. In summary, there are vomiting considerations to all the actions
                            which may be proposed in the corridor. We will have to weigh these in
                                <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0422"/>the balance each time. The
                            essential consideration is that we must be sure, in each instance, that
                            the objective we seek is worth the price we will have to pay.</p>

                        <p>1. My political reservations about certain features of Shining Brass have
                            always been associated with prospect that U.S. military personnel would
                            be captured during these operations and would be paraded as flagrant
                            violators of 1962 Geneva Accords. Our experience with <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> personnel captured during Leaping Lena
                            indicates that Vietnamese elements of these teams will readily reveal
                            all features of operations during interrogation. We could therefore
                            expect details of these operations to be thoroughly exposed.</p>
                        <p>2. An exposure in this form would not only prove highly embarrassing to
                            U.S., but also to Lao Government. Since it is currently contemplated
                            that Shining Brass should proceed without knowledge of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, this embarrassment might produce
                            strong reaction from Souvanna, and jeopardize most of our other
                            operations in this country.</p>
                        <p>3. It has always seemed to me that U.S. and <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> personnel who are introduced into Laos by ground
                            infiltration can claim either that (A) <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0423"/>they were captured on Vietnam side of border, or (B)
                            they did not know where border was. Hence, any chances of violating Laos
                            territory could be anticipated and neutralized by a claim that U.S.
                            personnel had been captured by Viet units in Vietnam and dragged across
                            border into Laos.</p>
                        <p>4. On other hand, units introduced by air, with virtual certainty that
                            operational details would be disclosed to enemy (para 1) if captured,
                            would leave us with much egg on face. Therefore, I decidedly feel that
                            we should reserve any authorization for use of air reinforcement or
                            resupply until experience factor in Shining Brass gives us grounds on
                            which to make a political judgment. It may be that Shining Brass
                            operators themselves will decide, for military reasons, that they do not
                            wish aerial resupply and reinforcement because such conspicuous activity
                            would compromise their locations. However, if, for military reasons,
                            they wish (after gaining experience factor) to recommend aerial resupply
                            or reinforcement, then, at that stage, we will have to get a political
                            judgment at fairly high levels. One element in that judgment will be
                            decision whether we will wish to clear entire operation with
                            Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>5. As previously stated (Ref B) I would have no objection to emergency
                            aerial extraction, since I would regard this as an <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> action, similar to those we conduct
                            regularly for downed airmen. Aerial extraction as a routine operation
                            measure would, however, fall into same general caveats stipulated in
                            para 4 above.</p>
                        <p>6. I note that no mention is made in Ref A concerning proposal in Ref C
                            that certain selected teams be launched into corridor from Laos. I
                            assume therefore, that this feature is not authorized. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate Communist and other international reaction to US moves to
                            establish a barrier across Communist supply lines in the Lao
                            panhandle.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Assumption</p>
                        <p>A US force of three divisions moves into Laos along Route 9 from Thailand
                            and South Vietnam to seize and hold terrain along the route with the
                            purpose of blocking Communist troop and supply movements.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. The international reaction to the US action would be generally
                            unfavorable particularly if the action were not undertaken with the
                            approval of Premier <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>. We believe, however, that the chances are less
                            than even that Souvanna could be persuaded to make such a request. He
                            would recognize that the US action would be a clear and conspicuous
                            violation of the 1962 Geneva accords upon which the legitimacy of his
                            government rests. He would see few advantages to Laos and many dangers
                            in such a deployment. He would fear that Laos would become a major
                            battleground for the powers involved in Vietnam, that the Communists
                            would retaliate against his forces in other parts of Laos, and that the
                            Chinese Communists might occupy the northern provinces. Souvanna has
                            approved of US escalation of air activity and he would probably prefer
                            to see this course fully exploited, including the destruction of Hanoi
                            before considering involvement of Laos in a US-Communist ground war.</p>
                        <p>2. If the US pressed for a Lao Government request in the face of
                            Souvanna's opposition, he might be led to resign and return to France as
                            he has so often threatened to do. While most other Lao leaders including
                            the King would be likely to share Souvanna's misgivings, Souvanna <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0425"/>could probably be removed by a
                            coalition of conservative forces. Under such circumstances, however, any
                            successor government would be seen by most of the world as a US
                            puppet.</p>
                        <p>3. If Souvanna could be persuaded to call for the US divisions, his
                            assent would almost certainly be conditioned on explicit US guarantees
                            of protection against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> and Chinese
                            counteraction in northern and central Laos. He might not request
                            immediate deployment of US forces into these areas, lest this
                            precipitate the very attacks he wished to prevent, but he would almost
                            certainly demand some tangible evidence that substantial US forces would
                            indeed be available quickly if needed. This would be equally true of any
                            successor government.</p>
                        <p>4. The Thai would be concerned about having such a larger foreign
                            presence in their country as the assumed action implies, but their major
                            concern would be that the action might bring Communist, particularly
                            Chinese, attacks against Thailand. We believe that the Thai would
                            cooperate with the US plan if given specific commitments on defense
                            measures to protect Thailand in such a contingency. The Thai leaders
                            would also almost certainly seek a substantial increase in US aid. At
                            least sporadic sabotage efforts against the lines of communication
                            across Thailand to the Route 9 region of Laos would be likely, and their
                            protection would require a fairly large-scale Thai or US effort. In
                            short, the US would almost certainly be called on to provide substantial
                            forces, in Thailand as in Laos, over and above those which would be
                            required to seal off the Communist supply route through Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. In Cambodia, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName>'s
                            fear of US-supported attacks from South Vietnam or Laos would probably
                            be increased. He would vociferously condemn the US action and would
                            probably reiterate in some form his demands for international guarantees
                            of his borders. At the same time, however, he would probably be
                            impressed with this new evidence of US determination not to be driven
                            out of Southeast Asia. Until he had some clearer view of the outcome of
                            the US effort, he would probably be reluctant to see any expansion in
                            the use of Cambodia as a supply route and safe-haven for Communist
                            forces in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>6. The North Vietnamese would almost certainly learn that a major US
                            operation was being planned; they already seem to suspect that something
                            of the sort may be under consideration. As US intentions became clearer,
                            Hanoi and the Pathet Lao would seek to discourage Souvanna's concurrence
                            and to deter the US action by propaganda and by actions designed to
                            demonstrate their ability to threaten areas about which the Lao and Thai
                            governments are sensitive, e.g., by troop movements in the north and
                            central areas. At the same time they would send some reinforcements into
                            southern Laos and attempt to stockpile supplies. As the dimensions of
                            the US build-up in northeast Thailand became more apparent, Hanoi might
                            undertake limited offensives to bring <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>
                            <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0426"/>forces close to the Mekong
                            along the Thai frontier. All this would be accompanied by a vigorous
                            propaganda campaign designed to heighten fears in Laos and abroad of an
                            ever-expanding conflict.</p>
                        <p>7. Once the US operation was under way, the North Vietnamese might choose
                            to engage US forces at specific points where the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> units would have
                            local advantage, but the normal pattern probably would be vigorous
                            harassment and ambush. Though the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> would probably
                            exert strong pressures in north and central Laos, we believe the chances
                            are less than even that they would launch a major counter-offensive
                            against the US forces in the south. For at least some time, the
                            Communists would be likely to feel that they could maintain the
                            insurrection in South Vietnam, even if the US interdiction reduced the
                            levels of activity. Hanoi and the Pathet Lao would call for condemnation
                            of the US action under the Geneva agreement. The North Vietnamese might
                            set up a rival Lao “government of National Union,” particularly if
                            Souvanna were no longer in power. They would at least withdraw their
                            diplomatic representation from Vientiane, have the Pathet Lao sever all
                            contacts with the Lao government, and threaten to renounce the Geneva
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>8. Even after the US forces had occupied the length of Route 9, we
                            believe that the North Vietnamese would continue efforts to infiltrate
                            some cadres through Laos. At the same time, Hanoi would increase its
                            reliance on sea routes directly to South Vietnam or via Cambodia, at
                            least for arms, equipment, and supplies. If the US effort, including not
                            only the action assumed here but other actions against Communist lines
                            of communications, succeeded in seriously restricting the supply of men
                            and materiel to the insurrection in South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese
                            would have to decide whether to reduce sharply the level of that
                            insurrection, to seek a respite through political means, or to attempt
                            to break the blockade through military action against the US forces in
                            Laos or elsewhere. Which course they would choose would depend on a
                            number of circumstances of the moment, such as conditions in North
                            Vietnam, Chinese pressures, Hanoi's reading of the US domestic
                            situation, and, probably most important, the strength of the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> and the state of its morale.</p>
                        <p>9. The Chinese Communists, as well as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, have been anticipating US intervention in the corridor
                            and have already made propaganda attacks and threats aimed at blocking
                            such action, including private warnings that they might have to send
                            troops into Laos if the US commitment in Vietnam were greatly increased.
                            We believe, however, that so long as the US forces had not crossed the
                            Laotian frontier in strength, Peking probably would not for its part
                            send Chinese combat forces in any strength into Laos, although it might
                            order threatening troop movements along the border. It might also
                            increase its assistance to the Pathet <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0427"/>Lao in northern Laos by introducing some specialized
                            personnel to support the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>. At a minimum, Peking would increase
                            its propaganda attacks and threats of intervention, and step up aid and
                            commitments of support to the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>10. However, once the US had crossed into southern Laos in force, the
                            Chinese Communists almost certainly would counter in the northwest by
                            supplying personnel and equipment to augment Communist capabilities
                            there and expand Communist control into areas close to the Thai
                                border.<note n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">The Director of Intelligence and
                                Research believes that the estimate should state specifically that
                                “personnel” probably would include some regular Chinese Communist
                                combat units, since “personnel” can be interpreted as meaning only
                                limited numbers of specialized cadre. [Footnote in the source
                                text.]</note> This would be designed to facilitate infiltration of
                            Thailand, to intimidate Lao and Thai leaders, and to raise international
                            and domestic pressures on the US Government to avoid expanding the
                            war.</p>
                        <p>11. As long as the Chinese Communist leaders estimated that the US forces
                            would remain in the Route 9 area of south Laos, large-scale intervention
                            by Chinese forces would be unlikely. However, an imminent Communist move
                            against north Laos would lead the Lao government to demand US forces for
                            protection of this area. If the US responded by introducing US ground
                            forces into northern Laos—e.g., the royal capital at Luang Prabang—this
                            would in itself sharply increase the risk of Chinese entry.</p>
                        <p>12. The principal Soviet reactions would be political. In the initial
                            stages of the US deployment, Moscow would probably use its position as
                            Geneva co-chairman to reinforce other diplomatic and propaganda efforts
                            to block the US action or cause abandonment of the project. Moscow
                            almost certainly would like to see another international conference on
                            Laos. However, its actions would be strongly influenced by the course of
                            events and by the positions of Hanoi and Peking. For example, if Hanoi
                            and Peking recognized a Communist-dominated government in Laos, Moscow
                            would probably do so as well. At some stage, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> might renounce its role as
                            co-chairman, on the grounds that the US had destroyed the 1962 Geneva
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>13. On the military plane, the Soviets would avoid a direct commitment of
                            forces, but they might provide logistical and material support to
                            Communist operations in Laos as they did in 1961. This would require
                            Peking's cooperation, however, and the US action in Laos would probably
                            not cause the Chinese to drop their opposition to any significant Soviet
                            role in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>14. US-Soviet tensions would sharpen, both because the Soviets would be
                            under heavy pressure from the Asian Communists, and because the Soviets
                            would regard the US action as a repudiation of agreements <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0428"/>worked out with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1961 and 1962. The Soviets might
                            increase their own defense spending and even abrogate some US-Soviet
                            agreements or understandings. We doubt that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would retaliate against the US in Berlin simply as a
                            response to the US action in Laos. Some carefully controlled harassments
                            in Berlin are, of course, possible in any case.</p>
                        <p>15. The British, too, would be faced with difficult problems. As one of
                            the two co-chairmen of the Geneva conference on Laos, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would find it somewhat awkward, though of
                            course not impossible, to support US violation of the accords.
                            Furthermore, US policy in Vietnam is not popular with the British
                            public, and a major extension of the Vietnam conflict into Laos would
                            excite considerable opposition. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_WDM1">Wilson</persName> would be under severe attack
                            from his own left wing and from much of the public and press.
                            Nevertheless, he would not want openly to oppose the US on this issue.
                            Although he might be restrained from strong public support, he would
                            probably give private assurances and try to avoid public criticism of
                            the US action.</p>
                        <p>16. France would see the US action as a major extension of erroneous US
                            policy in Vietnam, and would strongly condemn it. Even if the action had
                            the blessing of Souvanna's government, the French reactions would be
                            severely negative; in this case, Paris might cut off its remaining
                            economic aid and political support for Souvanna's regime. If another
                            regime had replaced Souvanna's, it would be condemned by France, almost
                            as strongly as by the Communist powers, as a US puppet. We do not
                            believe, however, that France would initiate action against the US in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and we cannot see much that
                            France could do to make its opposition felt practically.</p>
                        <p>17. The reaction of other members of the world community would generally
                            follow predictable lines (e.g., approval from Taipei and condemnation
                            from Djakarta), with an increased amount of unfavorable reaction. If the
                            action had Souvanna's support, reactions would be somewhat less
                            unfavorable than otherwise. The success of the US action would also have
                            an important effect on world reactions; if the three divisions did not
                            result in speedy and pronounced lessening of hostilities in South
                            Vietnam, criticisms would be harsher and endorsements less enthusiastic.
                            Even though Hanoi and Peking have categorically denied that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has any jurisdiction in the Vietnam
                            conflict, sympathizers might move for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> condemnation of the US action. The likelihood of such an
                            effort would be greater, of course, if the US action were taken over
                            Souvanna's opposition.</p>

                        <p>1. I understand that Al Friedman will be calling you again on this
                                subject.<note n="2" xml:id="d197fn2">On September 10 Friedman sent
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName> a copy of a September 7 memorandum
                                from <persName corresp="#p_BRAFJ1">Blouin</persName> to him,
                                recommending that a <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal to
                                give <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> authority to
                                execute Duck Soup without recourse to Washington be approved by the
                                Department of State. Also attached to this memorandum was an undated
                                note from <persName>Bundy</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_TWC1">Trueheart</persName>, stating that <persName>Bundy</persName>
                                told Friedman that the Department of State “must stick to our guns.”
                                (Ibid.)</note> We have been informed that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>
                            are taking the matter up with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. Al's call may be a final attempt to reverse
                            our position before approaching the Secretary of Defense. The paragraphs
                            which follow explain the position we have taken on this matter and the
                            rationale.</p>
                        <p>2. Souvanna's Position. When Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> sought <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Prince
                                Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s views regarding this US-proposed
                            operation, Souvanna replied “with considerable deliberation” that in
                            principle he wished such enemy aircraft destroyed, but also in principle
                            he would prefer that it be done by <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            T–28's (Vientiane's 1802 of May 4).<note n="3" xml:id="d197fn3">Not
                                printed. (Ibid., Central Files, POL 27 VIET <gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>a. Caveats. Souvanna recognized, however, that in practice it seemed
                            doubtful that his T–28's could do the job. Since the alternative was US
                            aircraft, he carefully spelled out the terms of reference which would
                            have to be followed:</p>
                        <p>(1) Extreme care must be taken to avoid giving the Communists a big
                            propaganda play;</p>
                        <p>(2) Aircraft must not be struck on the ground;</p>
                        <p>(3) Aircraft must not be hit during casual flight; in other words,</p>
                        <p>(4) The enemy aircraft must be intercepted in the air while it is engaged
                            in the act of parachuting or dropping supplies to enemy ground
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>(5) Souvanna's approval of an intercept with these caveats pertains only
                            to operations in Sam Neua Province.</p>
                        <p>3. Department caveat. In addition to Souvanna's caveats, the Department
                            in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1121<note n="4" xml:id="d197fn4">Dated June 20. (Ibid., POL 27 LAOS)</note> said
                            that only North Vietnamese aircraft could be <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0430"/>intercepted in this fashion. If there is uncertainty
                            about the identity of the aircraft, it should not be attacked. This
                            point was made because of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>'s great concern that we not shoot down a Soviet
                            plane.</p>
                        <p>4. Evidence. The evidence of continuing enemy air drops is quite
                            intermittent and seldom confirmed. Reports during the past five months
                            concerning unidentified aircraft in Laos refer to sightings in other
                            provinces as well as Sam Neua. Few actual sightings of drops have been
                            reported and the reports are mostly by small friendly units. All recent
                            reports indicate enemy aircraft activities have been at night—therefore
                            not subject to attack under the restrictions outlined above.</p>
                        <p>5. Absence of Lao Request. During this entire 5-month period, neither the
                            Lao armed forces nor <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> has raised this subject with U.S. officials.
                            Presumably, if the volume of air drops to enemy troops in Sam Neua was
                            sufficiently great to affect the struggle there, the Lao themselves
                            would have attempted an intercept or request the U.S. to intervene.</p>
                        <p>6. T–28 Pilots. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> suggested making the intercept with T–28's
                            flown by Air America pilots. The Department so far has refused to give
                            this authorization and suggested, instead, that Lao [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] pilots be
                            selected and perhaps trained in T–28's for this operation (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1121). Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> replied that no such Lao [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            pilots are proficient enough to perform the task.</p>
                        <p>a. L/<gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> has reminded us that civilians who
                            engage in hostilities are usually treated as “unprivileged belligerents”
                            or possibly even as spies. Thus, if Air America pilots flying T–28's on
                            combat missions were shot down or otherwise fell into enemy hands, we
                            might have no legal basis for claiming for them treatment as prisoners
                            of war in accordance with <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>
                            conventions or accepted international law practice. Moreover, in such an
                            event, this evidence would give confirmation to Communist charges
                            regarding the para-military character of Air America and undermine our
                            position with respect to Air America, <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s and support for the Geneva
                            Agreements.</p>
                        <p>7. As matters stand, there have been no recent reports of daylight air
                            drops in the Sam Neua area and Bill <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> agrees that we would not be warranted in
                            keeping planes on alert to intercept. He has requested instead authority
                            to institute such an alert with Air America manned <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s and to carry out interception when
                            and if daylight air drops are resumed.</p>
                        <p>8. Our position is that the political risks are sufficiently great and
                            involve factors (e.g. US-Soviet relations) beyond the purview of
                            Vientiane, that the decision to intercept made last April should be
                            reviewed in the light of circumstances prevailing when flights are next
                            reported. This <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0431"/>position is
                            reflected in the attached draft telegram which Defense has thus far
                            refused to clear.<note n="5" xml:id="d197fn5">Attached was a draft

                        <p>1. Ref F proposed solutions for conduct of Duck Soup operations which is
                            concurred in by Amembassy Vientiane (Ref A). It is agreed that this
                            solution would constitute an acceptable basis for conducting such
                            operations at an appropriate time. However, in absence recent reports of
                            daylight air drops in Sam Neua area, we agree that you would not be
                            warranted in keeping planes on alert to intercept.</p>
                        <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0432"/>
                        <p>2. We have carefully considered your request for discretionary authority
                            to mount intercept operation when and as sightings and other conditions
                            so warrant. Conclusion is that political risks are sufficiently great
                            and involve factors (e.g., US/Soviet relations) beyond purview of
                            Vientiane, that decision to intercept made last April should be reviewed
                            in Washington in light of circumstances prevailing when flights are next
                            reported. Considerations underlying this decision are outlined in
                            paragraphs which follow.</p>
                        <p>3. When consulted regarding proposed operation in May, Souvanna concurred
                            but only subject to restrictions which would require that enemy aircraft
                            be attacked in flight and while actually engaged in dropping supplies to
                            enemy forces. Even under these conditions, Souvanna's concurrence
                            pertained only to operations in Sam Neua province (Ref D).</p>
                        <p>4. In Ref B Department laid down additional condition that only North
                            Vietnamese aircraft could be intercepted.</p>
                        <p>5. Operationally, above factors require that intercept be carried out in
                            daylight and by American pilots.</p>
                        <p>6. Reports of enemy air drops in Laos are quite intermittent and seldom
                            confirmed. Few actual sightings of drops have in fact been reported and
                            all recent reports of enemy aircraft activity have been at night.</p>
                        <p>7. During the last five months neither the Lao Armed Forces nor Souvanna
                            Phouma has raised this subject with U.S. officials, as they might have
                            been expected to do if air drops were materially affecting operations in
                            the Sam Neua area.</p>
                        <p>8. Use of Air America pilots in armed <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>s poses problem of permitting U.S. civilians to engage
                            in hostilities under conditions in which they might be treated legally
                            as “unprivileged belligerents” if they fell into enemy hands. Not only
                            would it be difficult to claim rights <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss> treatment for them in accordance with international law
                            and practice, but communists would be given confirmation of their
                            charges of paramilitary character of Air America. We have accepted these
                            risks in connection with <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> operations
                            but are more reluctant to do so in this case in absence stronger showing
                            military advantages. Emphasize that we are not ruling out use of Air
                            America pilots; we simply wish to review question of their use in total
                            context prevailing at time air drops are next reported.</p>
                        <p>9. Any recommendation to mount Duck Soup operation will be acted on
                            promptly.</p>

                            and political situation had ameliorated. Military officers had a greater
                            appreciation of their roles. Political leaders understood the situation,
                            as well as each other, better. Leadership was more cohesive; they now
                            cooperated. They understood the need for solidarity. During the last six
                            months the military situation had improved. Officers had a good hold on
                            the Army: discipline had improved. Armed Forces had been reorganized.
                            Officers had a full understanding of their roles. Many areas had been
                            seized from the Pathet Lao. Resupply from North Vietnam of the Pathet
                            Lao was more difficult to accomplish. As a matter of fact, the Pathet
                            Lao had not been able to mount their usual monsoon offensive.</p>

                            sent into combat against the enemy. In addition, approximately three to
                            four companies of former Pathet Lao are now in training.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President expressed appreciation for those improvements in the
                            situation. They had been well reported by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> complimented
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>. He said it
                            would take several more months to consolidate several recaptured areas.
                            Toward the effort the highway between Luang Prabang and Vientiane would
                            be repaired. Work would commence early in November. Road building
                            equipment was being placed halfway between the two cities and work would
                            then progress at the same time in both directions.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President wanted to assure the Prime Minister of two things.
                            First, U.S. economic, technical and military assistance will continue as
                            long as it was effective and so long as the Prime Minister's policies
                                <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0435"/>continued. The President
                            had been encouraged by the cooperation that existed in the field of
                            foreign assistance between of Governments of Laos and the United States.
                            The Congress supported the program. Secondly, the U.S. Government was
                            determined to resist aggression in Southeast Asia. We wanted stability
                            and peace in the area. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> saw Southeast Asia as an entire region. Our
                            assistance to Laos was related to all other U.S. assistance in Southeast
                            Asia. We intended to establish peace in the area until a Regional
                            Development Authority could do its work.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had outlined his
                            plans for assistance in the economic development of the area in his
                            address at Johns Hopkins.<note n="3" xml:id="d200fn3">For text, see
                                American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1965, pp.
                                696–698.</note> That speech attempted to sketch the beginning of his
                            hopes for Southeast Asia. Laos was an important part of that
                            development. The Nam Ngum Dam Project in Laos, it was hoped, would be
                            the first, or one of the first development projects.</p>
                        <p>The United States did not want war in the area. It sought peace. It would
                            remove its military as soon as conditions permitted. The United States
                            wanted each state to be free to work out its own destiny, to develop its
                            resources and people in its own way.</p>
                        <p>Close to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s heart
                            was assistance in the field of education. He had spoken his feelings in
                            his recent address upon the centennial of the Smithsonian Institution.
                            To succeed in the peaceful development of the region, all nations needed
                            the kind of courageous leadership the Prime Minister was giving Laos.
                            Observing the effectiveness and spirit of that leadership made us in
                            America want to do a better job.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> wanted the Prime
                            Minister to know of his deep intent to assist in the building of a
                            prosperous region. For South Vietnam we were recruiting doctors, nurses
                            and technicians to go to South Vietnam and to build hospitals and
                            dispensaries. This was the kind of peaceful project that the President
                            wanted for peaceful nations. He wanted peace, not war. At the same time,
                            the United States intended to do whatever might be required to defend
                            South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister was happy to receive assurances of the intention of
                            the U.S. to continue assisting Laos. His country needed economic
                            assistance to develop its resources. Laos had been at war for more than
                            twenty years, actually since 1939 and the Japanese invasion. Laos had
                            borne a heavy burden. It was difficult to improve life while surviving
                            the attacks of the Vietnamese and Chinese. If Laos were to survive, it
                            would need help.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister appreciated the adherence of the United States to the
                            provisions of the Geneva Convention, but Laos needed weapons <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0436"/>and firepower at least equal to that of
                            the enemy. Now, Laos suffered a disadvantage. The Pathet Lao and
                            Vietnamese had Russian and Chinese automatic weapons, while Laos had
                            single-shot carbines. His army knew the terrain better. That was why
                            several spectacular victories had been won. There had been the victory
                            by the Cadet School over the Pathet Lao and People's Army of Vietnam
                                (<gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss>)—where Vietnamese soldiers
                            were captured. There was also the victory at the village of Hua Muong,
                            twenty-five miles north of Luang Prabang which had been recaptured.</p>
                        <p>These engagements demonstrated, as he had told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, the need for helicopters. The
                            height of the mountains and the distance between objectives required
                            that air transport was necessary if soldiers were to move more than a
                            few miles on foot each day.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President presumed that the Departments of State and Defense
                            were looking into the problem.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stated that they
                            were.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said his National Armed Forces had only one helicopter
                            for the North and one for the South. When Hua Muong was retaken only one
                            helicopter transported one infantry company and cannons.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said we would be glad to look into it.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister repeated that the Force Armee Royale (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>) had only two helicopters.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President laughed, indicating he had well understood the Prime
                            Minister's point.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> smiled and said
                            Laos needed ten helicopters.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said that resistance to Communist aggression was a
                            basic part of our response in Southeast Asia. While mindful of each
                            other's needs, we must be sufficiently ingenious so that we all could
                            work as a team. Laos was independent. Thailand was independent. Each
                            needed the cooperation of the other. The U.S. wanted to help each state
                            to cooperate with the other. In any case, we would look into the Prime
                            Minister's suggestion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> said that he
                            explained to Bangkok officials his understanding that Laos needed a free
                            Thailand. Internal trouble in Thailand acted against the interests of
                            both countries. Laos was the first line of defense for Thailand. We
                            should do all we can to prevent the spread of difficulty. He had
                            explained this to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and asked him to explain all this clearly to
                            Thailand. Many lower level officials in Thailand still sympathize with
                            General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and act against the
                            interests of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said his Government was aware of the problem and
                            understood the Prime Minister's concern.</p>
                        <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0437"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> said he would
                            stop in Bangkok to achieve greater cooperation between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President said it would also help for Southeast Asian
                            responsible leaders to state publicly upon occasion that they knew the
                            U.S. desired peace. Our country was subjected to propaganda to undermine
                            the confidence others had in our peaceful intentions. The Prime Minister
                            had witnessed demonstrations here against our policy in South Vietnam.
                            These demonstrations were meaningless as far as changing our policy was
                            concerned. They were well organized by forces that attempt to subvert
                            Laos and elsewhere. He had no doubt the organizing capacities of
                            Communist Parties around the world were at work in New York and Saigon.
                            The people know President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            understands strategic warfare; the President wants to keep conflict
                            limited. Only one-tenth of our demonstrators knew what they were doing.
                            The rest just were demonstrating because they are young. We believe in
                            free speech and assembly. The U.S. was in South Vietnam to stay.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President and the U.S. would be honored if the Prime Minister
                            were to act as our spokesman of our peaceful intentions.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister knew the position of the United States. He appreciated
                            its intentions.</p>

                        <p>1. After greeting the Prime Minister and his party, the Secretary said
                            that he would be interested in hearing the Prime Minister's views on the
                            situation in Southeast Asia. The Prime Minister said that he had
                            relatively little information regarding the situation in North Viet-Nam,
                            but it is generally believed in Laos that there are serious difficulties
                            in North Viet-Nam which have been increased as a result of US air
                            activities. These bombings, he said, are having an effect in Laos, since
                            it is quite clear that very small amounts of supplies are now coming
                            into Laos for the Pathet Lao from North Viet-Nam. In particular, the
                            bombing of roads leading into Laos made it extremely difficult, in the
                            Prime Minister's opinion, for the North Vietnamese to send men and
                            supplies into Laos. He admitted, of course, that it is impossible to say
                            what might happen when one was dealing with the North Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>2. The Secretary asked what Pathet Lao intentions might be for the
                            future. He believed that the Pathet Lao could not fail to see that, with
                            the US commitment in Southeast Asia and the deployment of US forces
                            there, a dark road was ahead for them if they were to try to achieve
                            their objectives. The Secretary wondered whether the Pathet Lao leaders
                            might not come around to the realization that the time had come to stop
                            their aggressive activities. The Prime Minister replied that the Pathet
                            Lao were the prisoners of Hanoi in the same manner that North Viet-Nam
                            was a prisoner of Peiping. Hanoi could do nothing against Peiping's
                            will, although it might realize that as a result increased suffering was
                            being inflicted on the population. He commented that Peiping would fight
                            to the last North Vietnamese just as North Viet-Nam would fight to the
                            last Pathet Lao. Until a solution was found to the Viet-Nam problem,
                            Hanoi would not allow the Pathet Lao to return to the national
                            community, since such a return would mean government control of Pathet
                            Lao-held areas, thus preventing infiltration through Laos from North
                            Viet-Nam into South Viet-Nam.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to the Secretary's question, the Prime Minister said that
                            there had never been good faith on the part of Hanoi or Peiping during
                            the Geneva conference or subsequently. Only a few technicians were
                            withdrawn from Laos following the conclusion of the 1962 Agreements, and
                            North Vietnamese troops have remained in force in Laos since that time.
                            As proof of this, the Prime Minister showed interrogation reports of
                            North Vietnamese prisoners who have been captured in Laos during the
                            past year. Although the Communist <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            members (i.e. the Poles) were fully aware of the illegal presence of
                            North Vietnamese troops in Laos, they would not admit it officially.</p>
                        <p>4. The Secretary then asked the Prime Minister whether he anticipated any
                            changes in Laos in the next several months and whether developments in
                            Laos depended solely on the situation in Viet-Nam. The Prime Minister
                            replied that, although the situation in Laos was largely <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0439"/>affected by developments in Viet-Nam,
                            at the same time there had been improvement in the military situation
                            over the past ten months.</p>
                        <p>5. The Prime Minister said that for the past four months, the Lao
                            Government was making efforts to move the population out of the areas in
                            south Laos where the Lao Air Force was bombing North Vietnamese
                            infiltration activities and facilities. Aside from humanitarian
                            considerations, this program was part of the government's strategy to
                            turn the area in which the North Vietnamese were moving into a desert so
                            that they could not rely on the local population for food and
                            transportation. He also mentioned that Lao guerrilla groups were
                            operating behind enemy lines to interdict Pathet Lao/North Vietnamese
                            movements.</p>
                        <p>6. The Secretary pointed out that an important aspect of US foreign
                            policy that was not always understood abroad was that the United States
                            had no ambition to impose its presence or seek advantages in other
                            countries. On the other hand, people should know that Peiping wants to
                            dominate their countries and advocates a doctrine of world revolution.
                            The Prime Minister responded that he fully realized the danger which
                            Pei-ping constituted for Laos. At the same time, however, Laos was
                            fated, because of its geographic proximity, to have to live with the
                            Chinese.</p>
                        <p>7. The Secretary expressed the bitter disappointment of the United States
                            that the 1962 Agreements had not succeeded. At the time, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> had hoped that all
                            countries would get out and leave Laos alone. This was to be a very
                            important first step towards peace in Southeast Asia. However, Hanoi had
                            not lived up to its commitment and continued to interfere in Laos,
                            including its infiltration into South Viet-Nam. The Prime Minister said
                            that the failure of the Agreements had also been a source of
                            disappointment for Laos. He had gone to Hanoi and Peiping in early 1964
                            in an effort to find a solution. Peiping told him to talk to the leaders
                            in Hanoi. In his talks with Tran Van Do, Ho Chi Minh and Giap, he was
                            told that North Viet-Nam would not leave Laos as long as the South
                            Vietnamese problem was not settled. Following this trip and the events
                            of the April 19 coup, the Pathet Lao Ministers, claiming that their
                            safety was in danger, left for the Plain of Jars.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to the Secretary's query about General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>, the Prime Minister mentioned
                            recent talks with Thai Government officials in Bangkok in which he had
                            underscored the importance of political tranquility in Laos so that
                            necessary efforts could be concentrated on facing the enemies from the
                            east. He said that <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            continued to be active against the interests of both Thailand and Laos
                            and he had told Marshal Thanom that since Laos was the first line of
                            Thailand's defense, the Thai Government should do everything in its
                            power to curb the activities of those elements in Thailand which
                            sympathized with <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>. He
                            planned to discuss this matter with the Thai again on his return and
                            said that he had mentioned this matter to the Vice President during
                            their <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0440"/>meeting. The Secretary
                            commented that we had had a good response from the Thai officials on the
                            question of General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> from
                            which we were encouraged.</p>
                        <p>9. Turning to the subject of US aid to Laos, the Prime Minister said
                            there was a urgent need for increased US economic and military aid and
                            he had discussed this with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and, earlier in the day, with the Vice
                            President. He pointed out that Laos was experiencing some difficulties
                            as a result of recent changes in the United States import program
                            (USIP). He said it was vital that at least certain items relating to
                            construction projects be reinstated in the program, particularly since
                            construction activities were underway. He stated that it was important
                            that US economic aid be maintained at the same level as last year and
                            that support for the armed forces be increased. He specifically
                            mentioned the fact that, although our military assistance was based on a
                            Lao force level of 50,000 men, the Lao budget was supporting a force
                            level of about 75,000 and that the US should, therefore, raise its
                            support to the level of the actual strength of the Lao armed forces. The
                            Prime Minister also referred, as he had to the Vice President, to the
                            pressing need for more automatic weapons and ten helicopters. (On
                            October 19, during the military briefing which was given to the Vice
                            President by the Department of Defense, the Prime Minister referred to a
                            need for ten to fifteen helicopters in talking with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName>.) Helicopters, he said,
                            were badly needed for the movement of troops and equipment in areas
                            where there were no roads and the Lao at present only had two
                            helicopters.</p>
                        <p>10. The Secretary commented on the situation in Indonesia and said he
                            felt that <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> could
                            not fail to realize that Peiping had received a serious setback there
                            with a resulting reduction of its influence in Southeast Asia. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> also knew, as a result
                            of US efforts in Viet-Nam, that Peiping would not be permitted to
                            overrun Southeast Asia. Since <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince
                                Sihanouk</persName> might not want to be on the wrong side in
                            Southeast Asia, the Secretary wondered why he did not become a genuine
                            neutralist. The Prince Minister agreed that it was extremely difficult
                            to try to analyze <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince
                            Sihanouk</persName>'s motives. He said that Lao relations with Cambodia
                            were rather bad. The Prime Minister then went over some of the
                            developments in this respect. He said <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince
                                Sihanouk</persName> had thrown himself into the arms of Peiping in
                            order to maintain the integrity of his country. However, in the face of
                            the demonstration of US determination to resist Chinese aggression in
                            Southeast Asia, <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName>
                            might realize that he had been wrong in betting on Chinese victory and
                            non-intervention by the United States. The Prime Minister said he felt
                            that any change of mind on the part of <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Prince Sihanouk</persName> would bring about a loss of prestige for
                            him and that this prestige had already been badly shaken by the recent
                            Soviet refusal to receive him. Another factor, however, which might make
                            him change his mind would be the development <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0441"/>of internal pressures, should they occur, as a result
                            of a deterioration in the economic situation in Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>11. Commenting briefly on Indonesia, which he had visited last Spring,
                            the Prime Minister said that, in his view, the Indonesian army disliked
                            the Communists and was rather western-oriented, mainly because of the
                            large number of officers who had been trained in the United States.</p>
                        <p>12. The Secretary expressed the appreciation of the United States for
                            Laotian support to the total effort in Southeast Asia. He said that the
                            voice of the Prime Minister was helpful in the present situation, even
                            though our two countries could not consider ourselves as allies, since
                            Laos was neutral. Nevertheless, under the present difficult
                            circumstances, our two countries could have a common attitude with
                            regard to Hanoi. The Prime Minister commented that in the light of
                            information he had, North Viet-Nam could not hold out much longer. He
                            said that unless there was increased pressure on the US by Moscow, Hanoi
                            might be willing to accept proposals for negotiations in about four to
                            five months. The Secretary replied that the US was under no pressure
                            from Moscow, although he felt the Soviets were interested in a
                            conference on Viet-Nam. With respect to Laos, the Prime Minister said
                            that the Soviet Foreign Minister had told him that there was no change
                            in Moscow's position with regard to Laos, its neutrality or its Prime
                            Minister. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> had also
                            said he continued to believe in the need for strict compliance with the
                            Geneva Agreements. The Secretary commented that in our discussions with
                            the Soviets, we always made it clear that an agreement existed between
                            Washington and Moscow, at the highest level, guaranteeing the neutrality
                            of Laos. The Secretary added that the Soviet attitude toward Laos was a
                            factor of paramount importance in relations with the United States. At
                            the meeting in Vienna between President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman Khrushchev, Khrushchev said “we
                            agree on Laos” and this was something that the United States would not
                            let the Soviets forget.</p>
                        <p>13. In conclusion, the Secretary commented that the United States had
                            accepted Moscow's candidate for the post of Lao Prime Minister and we
                            had never regretted doing so. The Prime Minister stated that Moscow had
                            no influence on Hanoi which was under Peiping domination. However,
                            continued military action by the US might pull Hanoi away from
                                Peiping.<note n="2" xml:id="d201fn2">In a supplementary memorandum
                                of conversation, October 18, drafted separately because it was
                                classified Secret-Limdis, Souvanna stated that he was pleased that
                                all U.S. aid to the Meo (Hmong) was now going through his
                                government. He requested that U.S. assistance to other tribal groups
                                in Laos also go through the Royal Lao Government. Souvanna remarked
                                that relations with Vang Pao were excellent. As for his request for
                                additional helicopters, Souvanna stated that, if necessary, Thai
                                crews could operate them. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 7

                            non-project support which opponents have charged represents a reduction
                            in total U.S. economic aid. The Finance Minister is our principal
                            contact on foreign aid matters, upon whose collaboration we are heavily
                            dependent. He is one of the most important political leaders in Laos

                            when <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> returns to Laos in the
                            next day or so, he should be authorized to make the following public
                            statement:</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had advised him that the total
                            of U.S. aid to the economy of Laos will not be cut as has been charged,
                            but will be increased in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1966.</p>
                        <p>2. Even in the non-project area, which is the area of attack, aid to the
                            Lao economy will be larger than in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1965.</p>
                        <p>3. Furthermore, U.S. developmental aid to speed Lao progress and raise
                            living standards is being substantially increased, with major expansions
                            being planned in education, agriculture and rural development.</p>
                        <p>Such a statement, which would not contain specific amounts, would only
                            confirm publicly what we have for some time planned to do and what we
                            have privately indicated to the Lao Government. The non-project increase
                            results from the acceptance by all aid donors of major military and
                            civil service wage increases and our advocacy of expanded military and
                            civil operations by the Lao Government. The project aid increases were
                            implicitly promised by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> in his April 7 and subsequent speeches on
                            Southeast Asia development and in our testimony in support of the $89
                            million supplemental request to Congress for Southeast Asia. The three
                            fields specified are those in which the President has expressed strong
                            interest and in which concrete plans for expansions are well advanced
                            but not yet announced.</p>
                        <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0443"/>
                        <p>In order to maintain direct security operations, contribute to economic
                            stabilization and provide for a major developmental effort, the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> program in Laos will be $7–$10 million
                            larger than originally planned in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            1966. These additional funds will not be available until <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> appropriations are replenished for this
                            and other reasons in January.</p>
                        <p>I believe the statement we propose to authorize the Finance Minister to
                            make is not a new commitment in the narrow sense but rather the
                            confirmation of previously implied U.S. decisions in an ongoing
                            operation. However, I would appreciate your confirmation so that we may
                            proceed with giving Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> the authorization he urgently requests.</p>

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> came to Vientiane Sunday afternoon to
                            meet with Air Attaché and me concerning operations in Panhandle. As
                            result of meeting, I believe we have basis for satisfactory cooperative
                                U.S.-<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> air effort against
                            infiltration routes. However, in order implement fully, we will need
                            hold trilateral Vientiane-<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>-Saigon
                            reps meeting which I have proposed in other messages.</p>
                        <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0444"/>
                        <p>2. Substance of our preliminary understandings is that U.S. aircraft will
                            be able, subject to detailed arrangements to be worked out in aforesaid
                            trilateral meetings:</p>
                        <p>A. Fly night armed recce over currently restricted Steel Tiger routes
                            south of Route 9;</p>
                        <p>B. Share daytime recce over same route structure with <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> on basis system to be worked out at
                            meeting;</p>
                        <p>C. Share low-level, eyeball recce and <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>
                            functions with <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> in 0–1 type
                            aircraft. For this purpose General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> would like to accept <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s previous offer of ten 0–1 type aircraft;</p>
                        <p>D. Use Bango missions against any targets developed by actions cited
                            above.</p>
                        <p>3. We also skirted into question of operations in Shining Brass area, but
                            in absence <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> concurrence, I was
                            unable reveal to him fact that we were currently penetrating Lao
                            territory in this area. General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>
                            was somewhat cautious in reacting to this (perhaps because he knew I
                            wasn't leveling with him). He indicated his intention fly certain
                            missions in that general area himself. Therefore, unless we get this
                            straightened out soon, run risk of having some entanglement there. This
                            needs personal attention of Generals <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and Dupuy.</p>
                        <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> also said he wished
                            move his <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operational and staging
                            base closer to trail complex. For this purpose he needed some
                            improvements to Saravane Airfield over and above that work which we
                            currently have in progress there. This would not be costly, but might
                            involve a bureaucratic funding problem. I will look into it, but may end
                            up asking <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> to divert certain
                            service funds for this worthy cause. I suspect it will be less than
                            $100,000. You will note that he ran 45 T–28 sorties November 6 on Route
                            92 and estimates 200, mostly road workers, KIA as result his strikes.
                            These were staged from Pakse. He says he could double sorties if he
                            staged from Saravane.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, he offered help with some air infiltration of native agents
                            whom he had recruited into territory along Route 92. He required
                            supplies and communications support for this effort. I will work out
                            something on this with <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. In general, I think we have progress here and will need your closest
                            cooperation bring this into being. Please remember that the secret word
                            is “collaboration”. If Ma thinks we're trying to take over his
                            territory, he freezes. If he's permitted to play first string on the
                            first team, he's all American.</p>

                        <p>1. Recent U.S. aerial photography has revealed Pathet Lao/North
                            Vietnamese road construction and improvement activities along the
                            eastern part of southern Laos where infiltration routes into South Viet
                            Nam are located. Photography has specifically detected the construction
                            of an alternate route—Route 911—east of Route 23, south of Route 12 and
                            north of Tchepone. In addition, photography has revealed the use of
                            trellises to camouflage portions of this road, which is also covered by
                            heavy foliage. (Map attached.)<note n="2" xml:id="d204fn2">Not

                                (Ibid., POL 27–10 LAOS)</note> he also showed the Prime Minister
                            photographs of the trellissed road. Upon seeing these photographs the

                            matter to your attention since this would be the first use in our air
                            operations in Laos of defoliants. Pathet Lao propaganda has in the past
                            accused the United States of using defoliants, toxic chemicals and
                            napalm in its air operations in Laos. We can expect that the actual use
                            of defoliants will lead to a concerted Pathet Lao propaganda campaign to
                            highlight this development, which will be supported by Hanoi and
                            Peiping, as evidence of increased active US intervention and escalation
                            in Laos.</p>

                        <p>5. As you know, because of Lao sensitivities and our own considerations
                            with respect to the 1962 Geneva Agreements, we do not acknowledge or
                            otherwise comment on our air activities in Laos beyond acknowledging
                            that at the request of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> we have
                            been conducting air reconnaissance in Laos since May 1964, in the face

                        <p>535. 1. You should be aware that I am under considerable pressure from
                            Souvanna to concur in actions which it seems to me will escalate U.S.
                            operations on Laos to a point where we risk exposure to international
                            political criticism. So far, we have been able to avoid excessive
                            publicity and a major hassle, especially with Soviets, by judiciously
                            selecting our operations and handling them with maximum discretion.</p>
                        <p>2. The recent trend of events, including large-scale U.S. commitments to
                            Vietnam and Viet Minh attacks on Thakhet area, has apparently moved our
                            usually phlegmatic Prime Minister into a state of somewhat more reckless
                            endeavor. The joker in his attitude, however, is that no <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0447"/>matter how far we expose ourselves, he
                            insists that we still maintain our position of flatly denying that
                            anything is happening. In short, he has asked me to behave just like the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Ambassador and deny it all. In
                            the course of service to my country, I have become a fairly practiced
                            dissimulator, but I am not sure my talents in this direction extend
                            quite so far as Souvanna's desires.</p>
                        <p>3. The latest, most insistent plea, is for use of napalm by both U.S. and
                            Lao forces in country. I have stalled him regularly on this, and in
                            latest Thakhet operations have provided white phosphorus, which, in my
                            own layman's opinion, is better for flushing out caves anyway. However,
                            my own military, and particularly the Air Force pilots who have to risk
                            their necks daily over Laos, fervently endorse Souvanna's pleas.
                            Souvanna has yesterday specifically asked me to get a ruling from
                            Washington on this subject. I don't now whether this reflects the
                            possibility that someone in Washington encouraged him on this score, or
                            whether he is merely hoping for a better ruling there.</p>
                        <p>4. I can continue to take the heat in the local kitchen if that is the
                            preferred course. However, if Washington wishes to accede to Souvanna,
                            please let me know urgently. In any event, I would feel more content if
                            I could have a fairly detailed indication of your current thinking on
                            ground rules for napalm here.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Present Guidance</hi>—You will recall that the
                            question of possible use of napalm first came up in June 1964 in
                            connection with Phou Kout. <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0448"/>The
                            basic decision on the use of napalm in Laos, which is still in effect,
                            is contained in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1269 of June
                            29, 1964, Exdis.<note n="2" xml:id="d206fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.,
                                Central Files, POL 27–10 LAOS)</note> This joint State/Defense
                            message granted authority for the use of napalm in Laos by <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s whenever Prime Minister Souvanna,
                            with the Ambassador's consent, desired its use on military targets. You
                            were cautioned in this message to stress to Souvanna the necessity of
                            avoiding attacks with napalm even on military targets which are in close
                            proximity to areas inhabited by civilians.</p>
                        <p>2. You may also recall that this authority was never implemented because
                            of British concern over this proposed use of napalm in support of the
                            operations against Phou Kout. The British concern was based at the time
                            on the possible effect this action would have on the Polish proposal for
                            limited discussions on Laos. In informing Vientiane of these British
                            views and our decision not to use napalm at that time at Phou Kout, we
                            qualified the basic authority given in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1269 to prohibit the use of napalm without the prior
                            authority of Washington, except in a situation which the Ambassador
                            considered to be an emergency or a situation in which particular
                            offensive or defensive military action already undertaken would
                            otherwise fail. Souvanna's concurrence, of course, continued to be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Comments</hi>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in his telegram<note n="3" xml:id="d206fn3">
                                <ref target="#d205">Document 205</ref>.</note> has put his finger on
                            the main arguments for continuing our policy not to use napalm in Laos,
                            except what the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> can do under
                            specific conditions described under 2 above. These arguments are, of
                            course, first, the question of escalation and international reaction to
                            it and, second, whether it would be possible to hold the line publicly,
                            as Souvanna insists, on any comment as a result of pressures for
                            information on the subject. It seems to me that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> should be able to take the
                            heat in the local kitchen much more easily than he or we would be in a
                            position to take the heat from press queries and pressures, not to speak
                            of our allies and the Soviets. Despite all that we have done or are
                            doing in Laos, because of our restraint and the judicious application of
                            necessary actions to preserve the independence of Laos and hurt North
                            Vietnamese infiltration through Laos as much as we can, we are
                            nevertheless still in fairly strong international position. I have the
                            fear that with the intensification of our air operations and with the
                            authorization to use defoliants as two examples, to go this one step
                            further and to authorize the use of napalm by both US and <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> aircraft will very soon put us on the
                            road to destroying the good position we and the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> are in. Moreover, it does not seem to me that the level
                            of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> activity is such that the use of
                            napalm is critical (e.g., white phosphorus seems to be meeting immediate
                            tactical requirements <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0449"/>adequately). The use of napalm in US air operations against
                            infiltration also seems to me to be unnecessary at this stage and would
                            bring with it, should it be authorized, a whole series of problems
                            resulting from possible mistakes in hitting the right target and the
                            like (e.g., can you imagine what the reaction would have been had napalm
                            been used against the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> trucks west of
                            Muong Phalane, or in the mistake made in hitting BV–33?).</p>
                        <p>4. I hope we can continue to exercise the restraint which has really been
                            our strength in Laos in dealing with Souvanna's pressures for the use of
                                napalm.<note n="4" xml:id="d206fn4">In telegram 329 to Vientiane,

                                adhere to the present guidance on the use of napalm in Laos: napalm

                        <p>580. 1. I detect a recent tendency on part of press to zero in more
                            closely than usual upon possibility of U.S. air and ground operations in
                            Laos. This is a natural consequence of reports which indicate increased
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration through Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. It is disturbing, however, to note that responses to press inquiries
                            by senior officials are beginning to skirt away from our policy of
                            persistent prevarication and are running ever closer to the awful truth.
                            I recognize that, to the cognoscenti, such carefully worded statements
                            as those of <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Alex Johnson</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> are cleverly
                            constructed to avoid outright lies but also to avoid open admission of
                            our operations. Unfortunately most readers miss the nuances and there is
                            a natural tendency to conclude that we are admitting U.S. operations in
                            Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0450"/>
                        <p>3. British Ambassador, in capacity as co-chairman's representative, is
                            becoming most sensitive to recent press stories, especially because
                            Soviets are trying to get British to subscribe to condemnation of U.S.
                            actions. Brits will stoutly deny they are taking place; but will be hard
                            put to it if some official U.S. spokesman slips over the line and admits
                            what we are doing here.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore, I would urge once again that all responsible officials be
                            cautioned to be wary of press probing on U.S. operations in Laos and
                            that all consciences be collectively steeled against the continuing need
                            to dissemble.</p>

                                Developing Situation</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. The intensification of military activity in South Viet-Nam and the
                            evidence of the presence there of up to seven regiments of <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> forces has sharply heightened
                            interest in the passage of North Vietnamese men and supplies through
                            Laos. Although it still remains fundamentally true that the fight has to
                            be won in South Viet-Nam, there is a growing feeling that the support
                            which arrives via Laos can no longer be tolerated to the extent that it
                            was in a period when our involvement in South Viet-Nam was not so
                            deep.</p>
                        <p>2. Over recent months our efforts to interdict this traffic, both with
                            the Lao and with the South Vietnamese, have considerably expanded. We
                            are now carrying out the reconnaissance, intelligence and interdiction
                                <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0451"/>programs like Yankee Team,
                            Steel Tiger, Shining Brass and the Hard Nose and Kha intelligence
                            operations in the panhandle at an increasing tempo. There is in prospect
                            further expansion of these activities, for example, an increase in Steel
                            Tiger sorties from 3000 to 4500 per month. It is hoped also that Hard
                            Nose and Kha operations may move into harassment. These activities,
                            except for Yankee Team, remain covert and unacknowledged. Although the
                            air activity is rather widely known to be taking place, we have abided
                            by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                            Phouma</persName>'s stricture to refrain from any public acknowledgment
                            of these activities.</p>
                        <p>3. Quite recently there has been a tendency to speak more openly about
                            the problem of the corridor and, because of our deepening Viet-Nam
                            involvement, speakers have been impelled to approach closely to a
                            revelation of what we are doing. It may be that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, who appears to be
                            increasingly ready to charge the North Vietnamese publicly with what
                            they are doing in the Lao panhandle, may in due course be persuaded by
                            us to let the world know the actions we and the Lao are taking. If so,
                            this can be justified both as collective self-defense and as a response
                            to long-standing and repeated violations of the Geneva Accords by North
                            Viet-Nam. Unless Souvanna modifies his position, however, it is
                            essential that we honor our commitment to him, lest we suffer a set-back
                            in an ever-broadening cooperation which it is very much in our interest
                            to nurture. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s
                            most recent conversation with Souvanna<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">Not
                                further identified.</note> would appear to bear out Souvanna's
                            increasing readiness to face the facts squarely and it suggests that we
                            may be able to move more rapidly along the lines of para 2 above than we
                            had anticipated.</p>
                        <p>4. The infiltration problem has also occasioned a restudy of the various
                            proposals to draw a cordon sanitaire across the middle of Laos, roughly
                            along Route 9, as a means of sealing off the panhandle route. (This is
                            of course different from the spoiling thrust westward by <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> forces mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> by Souvanna.) This sealing-off
                            project, which would require the overt introduction of foreign forces in
                            violation of the Geneva Accords, might serve to seal off the Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail, although this remains a moot question from a military point of
                            view. Nevertheless it might relieve some of the heavy military pressure
                            in South Viet-Nam, even though leaving a substantial guerrilla and
                            insurgency problem still to be solved. However, we would inevitably be
                            trading that gain for the outbreak of a new war in Laos of a type at
                            least as intense as the war we were unwilling to fight in 1961. Can we
                            not assume that North Viet-Nam would throw itself into that fight at
                            least as hard as the one in the south, considering its long frontier
                            with Laos and commitment to the Pathet Lao as well as its apparent
                            determination to keep open an avenue to the south? It seems likely also
                            that Communist China would <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0452"/>feel
                            more threatened than at present and might feel the scales tipped in
                            favor of intervention, and there is no doubt that many nations, notably
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and including some of our
                            friends as well, would feel obliged to reach most adversely to our open
                            violation of an instrument they are party to.</p>
                        <p>5. If we reach a decision that the support from North Viet-Nam to the
                            south must at any cost be cut off, I suggest that we give consideration
                            also to the alternative of moving into the southern area of North
                            Viet-Nam up to approximately the 20th parallel (or if necessary up to
                            the Nape Pass as well) to cut off infiltration at the source. Such a
                            move obviously has the gravest implications such as the likelihood of
                            Chinese direct intervention, but I believe we should not minimize the
                            possibility of an equally strong Chinese reaction to our taking overt,
                            large-scale action in Laos to seal off the panhandle.</p>
                        <p>6. May I note in passing that current attention being given to the
                            panhandle problem threatens to revive some loose thinking and talk
                            which, if reported publicly, could do us incalculable damage. I have in
                            mind references to the possibility of our supporting Thailand in an
                            absorption of Laos or partition of the country between Thailand and
                            South Viet-Nam. Leaving aside the likelihood that an annexation by
                            Thailand in the context of the situation today would, in my opinion,
                            cure none of the military problems which Laos presents, we could also
                            count on a violent reaction by Communist China to any such move. We
                            would also see the disaffection of nine-tenths of those friends of ours
                            in Laos who have over recent years been prepared to cooperate with us
                            quite extensively on matters of common interest.</p>
                        <p>7. Our tentative view is that our military and intelligence programs in
                            Laos should be expanded as far as necessary and feasible to meet the
                            infiltration problem, remaining covert, however, except where Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> agrees
                            to public acknowledgment; and that a massive, overt military
                            intervention with the goal of sealing off the panhandle should not be
                            undertaken.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. This morning before his departure Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> told me he had had opportunity
                            inform Souvanna yesterday evening of his meeting December 3 with
                            Generals <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and Moore
                            (see reftel) and of increasing US concern over infiltration men and
                            supplies through Panhandle.</p>
                        <p>2. Souvanna told Ambassador US should employ whatever resources necessary
                            to counter infiltration but should in no event publicly admit conduct of
                            operations in Laos. We regard this as further striking confirmation of
                            PriMin's willingness play ball with us provided we can continue to avoid
                            publicity concerning operations in Laos. Latter is indeed crucial aspect
                            of our relations with PriMin on military questions, and we regard it as
                            of utmost importance that we continue maintain absolute silence about
                            what we are doing or plan to do.</p>
                        <p>3. Souvanna has approved installation of <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss>s in northern and southern Laos as navigational aids
                            to civil and military air operations those areas. Once problem of
                            manning these has been resolved (see paras 5, 6, and 7 of reftel) we
                            should be able to move ahead quickly with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> and 2nd Air Div to arrange for <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> installation. Recent serious
                            navigational errors in Panhandle make installation of <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss>s in our view both imperative and
                            urgent, and assurances to PriMin that we shall seek avoid further
                            strikes on friendly positions are not very meaningful unless we can foll
                            through with concrete actions. Team from mission will proceed Saravane
                            early next week to examine possible secure sites for <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> in that area and also to appraise
                            what improvements and facilities are needed to permit General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> to operate <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss>'s out of Saravane Airport. Will therefore appreciate
                            earliest reply of manning problem.</p>

                        <p>The substantial Communist effort over the past year to expand and improve
                            supply routes in the Laotian panhandle is now ready to show results. As
                            the attached memorandum notes, this effort has increased the Communist
                            capability to support an even greater level of fighting in South

                        <p rend="center">SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>The Communists have made a substantial effort over the past year to
                            expand and improve their supply routes in the Laotian panhandle. This
                            effort is clear evidence of Hanoi's determination to backstop the
                            Communist military campaign in South Vietnam. It increases the Communist
                            capability to support an even greater level of fighting there. It also
                            raises the prospect of stepped-up military activity inside Laos, which
                            might look attractive to Hanoi as a means of distracting our attention
                            from South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The program, which has involved upgrading existing roads and trails and
                            building new ones, is now ready to show results. With the re cent <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0455"/>advent of the dry season, a
                            road watch team positioned on Route 23, a key section of the supply
                            network, is already reporting trucks moving south in numbers comparable
                            to last season. The Communists should be able to do better this season.
                            By building a number of alternates and bypasses they have also reduced
                            the vulnerability of the supply system to interdiction by air
                            action.</p>
                        <p rend="center">COMMUNIST ROAD DEVELOPMENT IN LAOS</p>
                        <p>1. The Laotian panhandle for several years has provided Hanoi with a
                            primary avenue for supporting the war effort in South Vietnam. The
                            sequence of roads, rivers, trails, supply dumps, and base areas runs
                            through parts of Laos which have been in Communist hands for some four
                            years or even longer.</p>
                        <p>2. Over the last year, and especially in the past several months, the
                            Communists have been hard at work building additional truckable roads
                            which lead ultimately to the South Vietnamese border. The effort quite
                            obviously carries a high priority tag. One measure of this is that
                            Hanoi, despite a crying need at home, has sent mechanical earth-moving
                            equipment to the panhandle road program—a first in this remote part of
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. The program, pushed intensively right through the summer monsoon, is
                            now ready to show results. The North Vietnamese can now send trucks 100
                            miles farther south than they could before, all the way to the South
                            Vietnam border southeast of Da Nang. They have also made the system less
                            susceptible to outages in wet weather.</p>
                        <p>4. Moreover, by building a number of alternates and bypasses, the
                            Communists have reduced the vulnerability of their supply system to air
                            action. Aerial photography shows they have built an elaborate
                            vine-covered trellis over exposed parts of at least one section of new
                            road. Also, convoys now move almost exclusively at night.</p>
                        <p>5. A road watch team positioned on a key section of the supply network
                            reports that southbound truck convoys began moving about a month ago, a
                            month earlier than last year. In the past ten days an average of some 17
                            trucks per day have moved past this single observation point. Last year
                            the Communists averaged the same figure over the six-month dry season.
                            Recent evidence that the Communists are using fuel tanker trucks for the
                            first time indicates that they intend to do better this dry season.</p>
                        <p>6. We estimate that the Communists could theoretically deliver some 300
                            tons per day to South Vietnam during the six-month dry season, if they
                            used the road network to its maximum. To do so, however, the Communists
                            will have to move seven times as many trucks on the roads as they did
                            during the last season, a development which would in- crease their
                            exposure to air interdiction.</p>
                        <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0456"/>
                        <p>7. A force of at least 8,000 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese is ranged
                            along the road net. Additional troops may have been transferred into
                            this area recently. These forces, like Communist forces elsewhere in
                            Laos, are in position to launch attacks on government positions at any
                            time with little advance warning. At present, the prime task of these
                            forces is to prevent Souvanna's troops from moving eastward and
                            interfering with the movement of North Vietnamese troops and supplies
                            over the road and trail network to South Vietnam, where they are
                            pressing the guerrilla campaign against American and South Vietnamese
                            forces.</p>

                        <p>651. 1. I have spent most of my recent vacation worrying about the Ho Chi
                            Minh Trail. What concerns me is the prospect that any kind of direct
                            attack we may be able to mount against this skein of roads, paths,
                            rivers, streams and tunnels will fail in the ultimate necessity of
                            interdiction. Our air action currently harasses the routes and, as we
                            perfect our techniques, will make that harassment more severe. However,
                            we all conceded it cannot interdict. Shining Brass, even if stepped up
                            to air borne command proportions, could at best spasmodically harass.
                            Even the much discussed Route 9 invasion, either from Thailand or from
                            Vietnam, or both, would do nothing more than spread a thin picket of men
                            along horrendous terrain, and expose them in any one location to the
                            bloodletting of concentrated enemy attacks at places and times of the
                            enemy's choosing. None will assure interdiction.</p>
                        <p>2. As all our intelligence indicators suggest, we must, in the near
                            future, expect the movement of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            regular forces, perhaps in divisional strength, down the Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail. We must also expect the current <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0457"/>rather limited logistics operation to expand to
                            proportions more nearly comparable with the trail's capabilities. We
                            should therefore be searching to achieve maximum interdiction if we are
                            to have any hope of approaching isolation of the highlands battlefield
                            in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>3. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has told
                            me of his proposals re increased US forces for Vietnam. I assume these
                            are favorably under consideration in Washington now. We must assume, as
                            stated above, that their development will attract more <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> regulars and that the fighting will
                            assume ever greater conventional characteristics. So long as we are
                            unable to stem the flow through the Ho Chi Minh Trail, I wonder where we
                            believe this constant reciprocal escalation of manpower will lead
                            US.</p>
                        <p>4. My assumption is that Peking hopes it would lead us into two actions
                            which would have significantly deleterious political consequences for
                            the US. The first of these would be the bombing of population centers in
                            North Vietnam, which would achieve very little militarily, but which
                            would earn us all sorts of opprobrium in the Afro-Asian world and would
                            play clearly into Peking's racist propaganda, thus enabling them to
                            pursue their efforts to isolate US diplomatically among non-white
                            nations. It would also, of course, cause all sorts of trouble
                            domestically for the administration. The second action would be the
                            aforementioned Route 9 operation, which would also achieve much less
                            than is desirable militarily, but which would constitute a direct
                            provocation to the Soviets in Laos, bring Thailand irretrievably into
                            the war and generally follow the ChiCom desire to spread the conflict
                            geographically away from its concentration on North Vietnam, thus
                            diffusing the issues, increasing the opportunities for confusion, and
                            complicating our problems, both militarily and politically.</p>
                        <p>5. Before we start down these rocky roads, and while Washington is
                            presumably considering the deployment and commitment of considerable
                            number of troops, I would like to suggest an alternative mission for
                            these troops. At first blush, this proposal may appear radical or even
                            rash; but, balanced against the considerations adduced above, I am
                            convinced it would not only be more effective but actually more
                            conservative. My proposal is that we mount an amphibious invasion of
                            North Vietnam in the region of Vinh and that we cut the country in two
                            at the narrow waist which is not only the most defensible point, but
                            where interdiction of infiltration could genuinely be achieved.</p>
                        <p>6. This is not a new or an original suggestion. I recall first being
                            briefed on the Vinh concept by General Lemnitzer in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s office in 1962. At that
                            time, the number of troops involved seemed all out of proportion to the
                            problem we faced in Vietnam. Moreover, the political consequences
                            appeared to be so formidable that no one chose even to examine the
                            obvious military advantages seriously. Now, of course, the troop numbers
                            are very much within the framework of our <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0458"/>current consideration. Moreover (and this is what I
                            believe is new) I would further submit that the political consequences
                            of this proposal would be less drastic than that which would eventually
                            flow from apparently less radical measures.</p>
                        <p>7. The major question, of course and as always, would be the ChiCom
                            reaction. When I was in Hong Kong earlier this week. I threw the
                            question hypothetically to our senior China experts at the Consulate
                            General and got a curiously mixed measure of replies. Although more
                            thought this would trigger ChiCom military intervention than thought
                            otherwise, there were those who argued with much cogency that ChiCom
                            policy would still be to fight only to the last North Vietnamese.<note n="2" xml:id="d211fn2">In telegram 1179 from Hong Kong, May 21, Rice
                                reported that although his staff had mixed opinions as to the
                                Chinese reaction to U.S. ground operations against North Vietnam or
                                Laos to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the officers working most
                                closely on mainland China were of the opinion that the Chinese would
                                react militarily. (Ibid.)</note> Needless to say, they will continue
                            to study and discuss the issue.</p>
                        <p>8. To my mind, the ChiCom risk is more or less a constant, which we are
                            obviously, no matter what our course, going to have to approach more
                            closely in any event before we finish this business. The variables have
                            more to do and the choices more clearly lie (it seems to me) in the
                            realm of effectiveness of alternatives open to us and the constant
                            efforts to pinpoint, isolate, and concentrate on the immediate source of
                            decision in Hanoi.</p>
                        <p>9. One further element that appeals to me about the Vinh proposal is the
                            asset we would gain for bargaining in any political settlement. We have
                            earlier expected that, at any conference table, our bombing raids would
                            be the political equivalent of <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> terror
                            in the South. They may yet be, but we now (for “conference” proposes)
                            need a political equivalent of infiltration. By seizing and holding a
                            piece of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> territory, by emphasizing
                            that we are doing it in order to throttle infiltration, and by making
                            clear that we are willing to give it back when the eventual guaranteed
                            political settlement is reached, we would have our equivalent—in

                        <p>10. I could go on and argue this case for several more paragraphs but
                            feel I must have essentially made my point clear by now. Hence, I will
                            stop here. However, I am stopping only to elicit a response. If, as I
                            hope, others in Washington have already laid this issue out [for?]
                            discussion, I shall rest easy. If no such discussion is underway, I
                            would like to open it by a further, more detailed brief. Please let me
                            have reaction soonest.<note n="3" xml:id="d211fn3">In telegram 686 from

                            Thakhek area in November, largely as a result of <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> close air support, the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> is slowly re-establishing its defensive lines in the

                        <p> Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> have had to do
                            some work in countering criticisms and mild opposition that developed
                            and resulted from their absences from Laos. A special Assembly session
                            will take place in January. Originally it was intended to deal with
                            economic problems (i.e. criticism of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and US aid) but Souvanna and <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> have apparently succeeded in deflecting this and
                            the special session will be concerned officially with the <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> case, with economic problems to

                        <p>It looks like we will have trouble raising $16 million for <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss>. We have made our demarches here to

                            Canada and Germany next week). A wrinkle has developed over
                            implementation of the Nam Ngum project—the Lao want to manage the
                            project, with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> only managing
                            the funds. This, of course, is unacceptable to us and the Bank. A donors
                            meeting is scheduled in Washington December 22. We are still short of
                            the $26 million requirement. On the domestic economic side we are still
                            faced with the problem of local currency requirements for our aid
                            program, including Wapi expansion. (We have sufficient counterpart to
                            carry us through the fiscal year but will have a problem in early <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 67.) Vientiane is still calling for

                            about this project here and cannot give quick approval. There is also
                            the problem of new commitments.</p>

                        <p>During his recent Saigon trip, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> decided to authorize delivery to the Laos
                            Government of a total of 10 helicopters (in addition to the 2 they
                            already have) as rapidly as the necessary ground and air crews can be
                            found or trained. In fact, this will mean delivery of two additional
                            helicopters in January, with the remaining 8 to be phased over an
                            18-month period. <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has now
                            proposed a specific timetable to implement <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s decision.</p>
                        <p>In short, Souvanna will be getting what he wants as rapidly as the Lao
                            can operate the helicopters—which is probably somewhat less rapidly than
                            Souvanna hopes.</p>

                            and asked that we respond to these attacks by maximum air strikes.</p>
                        <p>3. I have undertaken obtain these strikes and have received allocation 36
                            sorties from Second Air Division for today's operations in this area.
                            Several forward positions (notably Site 58) have already fallen and we
                            anticipate heavy enemy pressure extending over several days which could
                            menace Nakhang (Site 36) and Tha Thom (Site 11) unless these attacks are
                            thwarted.</p>
                        <p>4. Realize that Vietnam stand down requires appearance of no hostile
                            activity originating from bases in Vietnam itself. However, with
                            suspension Rolling Thunder, there ought to be assets available from
                            Thailand and Seventh Fleet which could operate in Laos without press
                            detection.</p>
                        <p>5. Although I don't really see how Laos fits into <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> Christmas truce package, I would be willing concur in
                            suspension Barrel Roll-Steel Tiger normal operations. However, I can see
                            no way in which we can justify a suspension of Bango support for <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> units which, I am sure, will continue
                            to be under heavy <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> attack all during
                            Christmas period. <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> offer of truce
                            obviously does not apply to Laos, where Hanoi never admits they are
                            fighting in any event.</p>
                        <p>6. Please revise instructions soonest so that we can continue program
                            operations as needed.<note n="3" xml:id="d214fn3">In telegram 415 to

                        <p>As one example of an activity that has been remarkably effective in
                            reaching the rural population of Southeast Asia, you might be interested
                            in some details of our Village Health Program in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Through a chain of <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> supported
                            dispensaries in the rural areas, medical assistance to refugees in
                            northern Laos, and operation of emergency facilities in newly liberated
                            areas, we provide badly needed medical care and instruction in hygiene
                            to a broad cross section of the Laos population. We have found that
                            members of a family will travel more than 30 miles for medicines for a
                            sick person; thus our help and influence reaches far out into the
                            countryside, well beyond the areas considered secure for <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> or for the Lao Government.</p>
                        <p>Some statistics may serve to define the scale of this program:</p>
                        <p>—Support is given to 140 hospitals and dispensaries.</p>
                        <p>—150,000 patients are served each month.</p>
                        <p>—In the last fiscal year, 268 medics were trained.</p>
                        <p>This is accomplished by an American staff of only 5 doctors and
                            technicians. The facilities of Operation Brotherhood, a Philippine
                            organization supported in Laos by <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>,
                            are used for training. The most expensive part of the project is the
                            medicines and other commodity support, which costs $1.2 million out of
                            the current fiscal year total of $1.6 million.</p>
                        <p>The most interesting and unusual part of the project is in the hill tribe
                            areas of Laos. Most of the medical facilities throughout the refugee
                            areas are of primitive construction and are built of such local
                            materials as bamboo and thatch by the local people at little cost to the
                            U.S. and Lao Governments.</p>
                        <p>Paramedical personnel to staff these facilities have been obtained by
                            training local villagers who, in many instances, are totally illiterate.
                            Yet medical care is given to over 250,000 refugees, and approximately 80
                            percent <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0464"/>of the total war
                            casualties in Laos are given either complete or preliminary treatment
                            through this program.</p>

                        <p>703. For <persName>Bundy</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. Since I seem to sense increasing pressures on you from various
                            quarters to do something dramatic against Ho Chi Minh Trail in
                            southeastern Laos, I think it may be useful to provide you with more
                            detailed information concerning action already in progress so that you
                            can help whip some of these pressures into perspective.</p>
                        <p>2. As far as aerial operations are concerned, you should know that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has set up a special sub/command of
                            Second Air Division, called <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger
                                Hound</gloss>, which specifically concerns itself with infiltration
                            route. (I would add parenthetically that this organ was established at
                            my suggestion.)</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger Hound</gloss> has a mission and
                            an authority which essentially permits it to devastate all eastern
                            reaches of Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos, and to intercept all traffic
                            before it gets to south Viet Nam. This is accomplished as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. We have drawn a line from Laos, Cambodian, <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> tri-border point at YB 7535 to point on Lao-<gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> border approximately XD 9020. In the
                            area east of this line, <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger
                                Hound</gloss> operates O–1 observer and spotter aircraft with U.S.
                            airborne <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>'s, just as they do
                            in-country. Additionally, there is an Airborne Command Post C–130, with
                            two <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> officers <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0465"/>aboard, and instantaneous
                            communications with Savannakhet and Vientiane.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger Hound</gloss> has been running
                            from 100–200 sorties daily in this area since early December. My
                            impression is that this is a far more intense sortie rate than any
                            similar area in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> or than any
                            comparable area in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. There is, in
                            short, no limitation upon ability our air power strike this region
                            except limitations they impose upon sortie rate.</p>
                        <p>C. I might add that it had been my intention augment this ability by
                            recommending gradual extension <gloss target="#t_B52Statofortress1">B–52</gloss> raids to same area, but believe Air Force may have
                            jeopardized their own future here by inability keep their prowess from
                            the press.</p>
                        <p>D. Although it will be noted that the area given to our military to
                            strike covers the essential zone contiguous to <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, I have not precluded possibility that zone may be
                            somewhat further extended once operations in current area are perfected.
                            In my judgment, they are far from perfected as yet and could stand a
                            great deal of internal improvement on the U.S. side. Therefore, until
                            there is evidence that our people are really doing their job well in
                            this given area, I see no benefit to the home team in giving them more
                            to try to digest than they already have on their plate.</p>
                        <p>4. One other problem which probably is regularly dished up to you is
                            Shining Brass. I find the role I have to play in this exercise
                            particularly galling. This is essentially an Eagle Scout program devised
                            by some extremely well motivated and brave young men. However, except
                            for <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Max Taylor</persName>, nobody in the
                            U.S. military establishment has ever seemed willing to tell them that
                            the program is not militarily worth the price. The net result is that
                            all our military hierarchy stands aside and lets me shoot down these
                            schemes which responsible senior military men should never permit to
                            come to my attention.</p>
                        <p>5. This matter reached the height of absurdity last week when I was sent
                            photos of an area which Shining Brass wished to reconnoiter in order to
                            establish its military nature. It was clear to me from the photos that
                            the area was military and so I validated it forthwith as an air strike
                            target. The air strikes were carried out and secondary explosions
                            resulted. The target will be recycled as required.</p>
                        <p>6. Imagine my surprise when I got a complaint from the Shining Brass
                            people that I had given their target to the Air Force. This supposedly
                            would have been their objective in any event, so I can only assume I
                            deprived them of brownie points.</p>
                        <p>7. You will see from foregoing that, if our air program develops
                            properly, there should also develop an incompatibility between <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger Hound</gloss> and Shining Brass. We
                            cannot saturate an area with air attacks and still open it up for foot
                            soldiers to patrol through. I trust, therefore, you will be able hold
                            this one also in perspective.</p>

                        <p>713. 1. At Senator <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Symington</persName>'s
                            request, I met with him privately at Udorn January 4. In order preclude
                            possibility some aspects this conversation may be reported out of
                            context, I feel it prudent submit this summary record of our
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. Meeting opened with Senator asking for review recent U.S. air action
                            against infiltration routes in Laos. I showed him operational reports on
                            last three days' action and list of sorties scheduled for January 4.
                            There were 274 sorties for Steel Tiger areas fragged for that day
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>3. Senator pronounced this shocking waste of air power and said it was
                            crime to use high-priced, high-powered jets to “beat the bushes” in
                            southern Laos. He asked if I felt we were accomplishing interdiction by
                                <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0467"/>these air strikes. I said
                            that I did not and felt that at best we were causing enemy some
                            harassment. I pointed out that depots had been broken up into 5–10 ton
                            storages. Troop concentrations were limited to few hundred men each and
                            all were dispersed under the trees. There was very little that we saw
                            moving on the roads themselves.</p>
                        <p>4. Senator then said he understood it would take three divisions of U.S.
                            troops to try to interdict Ho Chi Minh Trail by land. He felt such
                            troops were not available, but wondered whether I thought they should be
                            asked for. I said I thought three division estimate was probably
                            conservative and doubted they could develop air tight plug anyway. I
                            went over with him nature of terrain, methods of infiltration, etc. I
                            doubted that ground troops constituted the answer.</p>
                        <p>5. Senator then asked whether I didn't feel air power, instead of
                            “beating bushes”, should be used to “knock out fuel storage areas, power
                            plants, port of Haiphong, and hit dams and levels which would flood
                            countryside in <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.” I suggested Senator
                            had better examine just how many such installations existed in North
                            Vietnam before he reached a judgment on that proposal. I recalled a
                            prime target list we worked up for <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            in late 1963 which had less than 100 targets altogether. It was my
                            impression greater part of these had already been hit and, although
                            certain significant areas remained unscathed, I wondered what practical
                            effect their destruction would have on continuing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> ability infiltrate troops into South
                            and maintain them in combat against U.S. forces there.</p>
                        <p>6. Our experience in Laos suggested that a fuel storage area, once
                            destroyed, would reappear in the form of 50-gallon drums scattered under
                            trees and in caves. It would cause <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            much more work, but would not seriously degrade their ability to get
                            fuel. Power plants would be either replaced by small generators or else
                            products they nourished would be provided by China and Russia. As for
                            dams, I doubted there were many available and busting levees on the Red
                            River would make sense only in July and August, when the river was in
                            flood. Breaking up Port of Haiphong would be a serious blow, but it
                            would just mean that cargo would come in by small coastal vessels
                            transshipping out of Port Wallut and elsewhere in south China. It would,
                            furthermore, place <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> completely in
                            ChiCom hands by excluding Soviet shipping. I felt that aspect had to be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>7. In short, I doubted efficacy of “strategic bombing campaign” in DRV,
                            and especially doubted that it would have any significant effect upon
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> infiltration into <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. My comments obviously pained the
                            Senator, who said that “everybody else” he had talked to on this trip
                            agreed with him that air strikes such as he proposed would “take DRV out
                            of the war.” I said I regretted being in such isolated minority but
                            thought I felt more comfortable in that position than I would be joining
                            those who stood elsewhere.</p>
                        <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>8. Senator then shifted discussion and said he understood I favored
                            amphibious operations at Vinh. I confirmed that I had submitted
                            recommendation for such operation and explained my reasoning for
                            recommendation. He then asked whether I felt such an operation should be
                            undertaken without air strikes against strategic targets he had
                            previously described. I said that I frankly did not know; that this
                            seemed to me a matter which military planners needed to study; and that
                            they should recommend what preparatory or supplementary air action was
                            required to make the invasion a success. The Senator asked whether he
                            could then say that I did favor bombing his strategic target list in
                            order to support “my invasion.” I reiterated my previous position about
                            military planners, etc., and we finished our meeting on this note.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: It might be helpful to give Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Symington</persName>, on his return to
                            Washington, some idea of the specific targets available for type of
                            campaign he envisages. Since he categorically says that he does not
                            favor “bombing <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> back to the stone
                            age”, he presumably proposes a fairly limited campaign, with, I fear,
                            limited results. I have the impression he intends propose this course of
                            action in public statements and in Armed Services Committee.</p>

                        <p>721. 1. Shining Brass operations in authorized areas of Laos Panhandle
                            along <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> border have been targeted
                            against “hard” objectives, which consist largely of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> storage depots, logistics points, and
                            troop concentration areas. With development of <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger Hound</gloss>, these objectives are
                            coming more and more under U.S. air attacks. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has therefore considered that Shining Brass ought to
                            be withdrawn from operations against these objectives, and moved instead
                            against relatively “soft” targets.</p>
                        <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0469"/>
                        <p>2. These “soft” targets have been defined to me as way stations;
                            porterage areas, etc., which are less likely to be heavily defended
                            strong points. Rather than having Shining Brass ferret these out for air
                            strikes, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> would propose that these
                            be made subject of harassment attacks by “exploitation forces”, which
                            would be larger in size and more extensive in operations than current 9
                            to 18 man intelligence probes.</p>
                        <p>3. Moreover, teams would be given task of operating in far more extensive
                            area than currently permitted. This area would, in <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s proposal, coincide with controlled
                            strike zone now utilized for <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger
                                Hound</gloss> air strikes. They would be introduced and extricated
                            by helicopter. They would be made up largely of Nung tribesmen encadred
                            by U.S. special forces.</p>
                        <p>4. In short, <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> suggestion would shift
                            Shining Brass from its original scouting and intelligence mission
                            against targets susceptible to air strike and would fashion it into
                            harassment mission against more fleeting or less tangible objectives.
                            This proposal has been put forward by MACV through military channels for
                            planning purposes and has been put to me informally to obtain political
                                judgment.<note n="2" xml:id="d218fn2">The proposal was formally
                                submitted by <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> in

                        <p>5. Department will appreciate, as consequence Souvanna's recent
                            statements to me that he could not take the international heat which
                            would accompany entry U.S. ground forces into Laos, that I could not
                            raise this proposition with him. He has, in effect, told me in advance
                            that the answer would be no. Therefore, chances of getting this approved
                            by him are in my opinion absolutely zero.</p>
                        <p>6. If need for operation is felt so compelling that it should be
                            undertaken without Souvanna's consent (and in the light of his known
                            objections) it would have to be done without consultation and we would
                            have to take the risks of those consequences which would flow from
                            possibilities of it becoming public knowledge either through enemy
                            capturing some of our American forces (there would be probably 30 or 40
                            Americans with each 540 man exploitation force) or through indiscretions
                            by friendly elements.</p>
                        <p>7. Viewed purely from subjective perspective, one immediate consequence
                            would be loss of my own credibility vis-a-vis Souvanna. I have taken
                            great care since I have been here to check out all our actions with him
                            and have never authorized anything which he has specifically
                            disapproved. I don't know what the consequences would entail if we
                            ignored him in this matter but would predict that it would make it more
                            difficult for me to obtain his concurrence in other programs of perhaps
                            greater significance than this one.</p>

                        <p>8. Ultimate judgment on these matters had perhaps better be made by
                            persons who will be more objective than those of us either in Vientiane
                            or Saigon. Balance of advantages and disadvantages can probably best be
                            seen from Washington. Would therefore appreciate Washington

                            and quarter in restricted conversation with Souvanna this morning and
                            two and one half hours of more casual luncheon talk. Present at first
                            meeting were Secretary General Lao FonOff, Cabinet Secretary, Fred Flott
                            (from Saigon) as interpreter, and myself. Present at lunch were Minister
                            Finance, three top generals of armed forces and members of U.S. mission.
                            Lao luncheon guests were obviously chosen to demonstrate unity of armed
                            forces with Souvanna-led government.</p>

                                one of the U.S. envoys in the “Peace Offensive” initiated by

                            visits had elicited from various governments and personalities. He
                            emphasized fact that, while President was sincere in his quest for
                            peace, this was not an effort to “save face” or abandon our commitments
                            to Vietnam. To underline these facts, he cited President's remarks on
                            Vietnam in today's State of Union address.<note n="3" xml:id="d219fn3">For text of the speech, January 12, see Public Papers of the

                        </p>
                        <p>3. Souvanna thanked <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> for
                            his exposition. He agreed with need for continuing pressure on Hanoi for
                            negotiations. He expressed view, however, that Chinese influence was
                            still very strong in Hanoi and that Chinese would do all in their power
                            to frustrate political settlement. He felt ChiComs must be faced
                            squarely at this time and be stopped before they develop an effective
                            nuclear force. He discussed subversive ChiCom activity in Thailand,
                            Burma and Cambodia, as well as Laos.</p>
                        <p>4. Souvanna then went on to say that he had just had a surprise visit
                            from Jerzy Michalowski, Secretary General of the Polish FonOff. Latter
                            was in transit through Laos on his way to Hanoi (our subsequent checks
                            with <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> manifests show that Michalowski
                            had just come from Hanoi and was en route to Bangkok). He had made
                            courtesy call and had discussed Vietnam and Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. Michalowski made two major points: (1) North Vietnamese considered
                            U.S. “peace offensive” was really an ultimatum. U.S. was, in effect,
                            saying that <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> must accept U.S.
                            position or be subject to new and more severe punishment; (2) it would
                            be “useful” for the United States to “accept the principle of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> four points”,<note n="4" xml:id="d219fn4">On April 8, 1965, <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong told the National
                                Assembly that it was the policy of the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> to respect the 1954 Geneva agreements on Vietnam
                                based on four points: (1) recognition of the rights of the people of
                                Vietnam and the withdrawal of the U.S. military from South Vietnam;
                                (2) no military alliance, bases, troops, or personnel in North and
                                South Vietnam; (3) settlement of the internal affairs of South
                                Vietnam without foreign interference and in accordance with the
                                program of the NFLSV; and (4) peaceful reunification of Vietnam
                                without foreign interference.</note> as a means of opening
                            discussions. Their substance could be thrashed out later. (Although we
                            attempted clarification of this rather vague formulation, Souvanna was
                            unable provide any further precision.)</p>
                        <p>6. Souvanna said he told Michalowski that Poles had placed things
                            backwards. If <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> wanted a détente, they
                            should show their intentions by action now. They must withdraw their
                            forces from Laos and they must cease violating Laotian territory by
                            sending forces down Ho Chi Minh Trail into South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>7. Michalowski had replied that Warsaw and Moscow both believed U.S. was
                            preparing to launch an offensive against <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> by sending troops from Thailand across Laos. Souvanna
                            had replied that, if <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> continued give
                            U.S. pretext by maintaining forces in Laos, there was <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0472"/>grave danger this would happen. He
                            therefore considered it all the more reason <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should withdraw its troops, in order eliminate this
                            pretext.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> expressed interest in
                            Michalowski visit and in his conversation with Souvanna. He recalled
                            that <persName corresp="#p_RA1">Rapacki</persName> had agreed make
                            contact with Hanoi and had said that it might require “unusual means to
                            reach them.” Perhaps Michalowski was the messenger. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> then discussed at some length
                            U.S. position re “four points” and our willingness talk about them with
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>; but said we could not accept
                            “the principle” of the four points if that meant, for example, agreeing
                            to the idea that the Liberation Front was the dominant authority in
                            South Vietnam. He asked Souvanna if latter thought Liberation Front had
                            any popular base.</p>
                        <p>9. Souvanna said that Liberation Front held its grip on people by
                            “authority of fear”. He said they had demonstrated they were not afraid
                            of killing people to enforce their control. The same occurs in Laos, but
                            the falsity of Communist claims is demonstrated by steady flow of
                            refugees out of Pathet Lao-held territory.</p>
                        <p>10. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> asked whether
                            Souvanna had any points he would like former carry back to Washington.
                            Souvanna said there was one matter he had raised with me which was
                            continuing to give him great trouble. This was crescendo of newspaper
                            speculation about U.S. intentions send troops into Laos. Although he
                            personally had accepted my interpretation and explanation Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>'s remarks in Saigon
                            (when Secretary spoke of action against infiltration), there was great
                            deal of public speculation that we were preparing invade Laos. He
                            pointed to Michalowski's statement to indicate type of trouble this
                            caused. Many people even assumed that presence U.S. troops in Laos was a
                            given fact.</p>
                        <p>11. Souvanna then cited recent newspaper story (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)
                            that there were Thai forces marching into Laos. He complained that U.S.
                            Spokesman (Department of State), instead of issuing vigorous denial, had
                            made “very weak” reply. This only augmented the speculation.</p>
                        <p>12. Souvanna asked whether Washington could make a flat and unequivocal
                            statement which would scotch all these rumors. He also asked if he could
                            quote Harriman as denying the story about Laos troops and the Polish
                            allegation about sending U.S. troops across Laos to attack <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> pointed out problems inherent in our
                            undertaking speak for Thai but agreed we could work out something about
                            denying plan to attack <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> across Laos.
                            (We subsequently worked out some phraseology which supports independence
                            and neutrality of Laos and denies intent send U.S. troops across Laos to
                            attack North Vietnam. It will be issued on sole responsibility of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> stating that these assurances emerged

                        <p>13. Conversation then turned to other matters, of which more important

                        </p>
                        <p>I found Prime Minister deeply concerned about increased Communist
                            infiltration into Laos. He was also gravely concerned about the
                            developments <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0474"/>in Thailand. The
                            primary problems there derives from the influence of the Chinese and
                            North Vietnamese. The head of Communist Party in Thailand has large
                            numbers of well trained and well organized cadres, most of whom are
                            Chinese in origin although having Thai nationality.</p>
                        <p>Thailand is further weakened by a second “Fifth Column,” in the presence
                            of the North Vietnamese refugees. These are well organized, have regular
                            contacts with North Vietnam and are in touch with the Pathet Lao in
                            Laos, to whom they supply money and arms.</p>
                        <p>To counteract this increased Communist pressure, Prime Minister desired
                            to increase Laos fire power and hopes for early delivery of United
                            States commitment of M1 and M2 weapons.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister also indicated his desire for further assistance from
                            the United States in the field of secondary education and agriculture.
                            The Prime Minister is eager to increase agricultural development,
                            specifically the production of rice. Past year six million hard currency
                            spent for rice alone. Drain for young manpower for military needs has
                            slowed rice production. Hence greater need for tractors.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister indicated that he was not surprised that the bombing
                            pause produced no results because China is interested in war, not peace.
                            He laid great emphasis on the expansionist aims of China because of
                            population pressure more than ideology. He stated bluntly, “you should
                            take advantage of this period when China does not have the bomb.”</p>
                        <p>And finally, he stated that the U.S. bombing raids in North Vietnam are
                            helpful to Laos because they immobilize the North Vietnamese troops and
                            make access to Laos more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Once again, I am impressed by the realism of Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and his determination
                            to defend his country. Although appreciating the limitations placed on
                            his Government by the Geneva Accords and the necessity to preserve a
                            facade of neutrality, he is not only willing but eager to develop closer
                            cooperation with the United States, including in the field of internal
                            security.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, his urgent request for military assistance indicates an
                            appreciation that Laos future even though a neutral country, is linked
                            to that of other countries in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. In general, enemy military activity throughout Laos continues about
                            normal for this time of year. As you know, period February through April
                            has traditionally been their season of major offensives, which then
                            terminate just before rainy season sets in. There have been the usual
                            spate of rumors (assiduously cultivated by the French) that this year
                            they will open a major drive into the Mekong Valley and, of course, they
                            theoretically maintain capability to do this if they choose. But we see
                            no extraordinary evidence to suggest that they so intend, nor would we
                            see any particular logic in their making such an effort this year.
                            Having said this, I would point out that the lines of communication with
                            North Vietnam are short and Hanoi's logic is not always susceptible to
                            rational determination.</p>
                        <p>2. The major military event which has occurred since departure <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> party has been a two (or perhaps three)
                            battalion attack by North Vietnamese units against Nakhang (Site 36) in
                            Sam Neua Province. These troops came up by forced march from Ban Ban on
                            Route Seven for this deliberate purpose. Although the objective
                            (Nakhang) is worthwhile in itself, the force deployed seems probably
                            inadequate to capture and hold the site against counterattack by <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces. Therefore, this action has the
                            earmarks of a politically inspired operation. They have chosen an area
                            of significance to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and ourselves
                            (which we use as forward base for air rescue helicopter units) and have
                            attacked units which have a special status for us because they are under
                            command of <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>. By good luck,
                            they even managed to wound <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang
                                Pao</persName> slightly in the action, causing his medical
                            evacuation.</p>
                        <p>3. I do not interpret this attack as a reaction to <gloss target="#t_VP1">VP</gloss> visit, but rather as a direct reaction to <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>'s loudly heralded but rather
                            feebly executed attack on Phou Kout. As you know, the Neutralists have
                            been attempting to take Phou Kout on and off for two years and Souvanna
                            personally encourages them in this effort. On this occasion, the
                            Neutralists' effort was widely publicized (again with French connivance)
                            and has provoked <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> promises of
                            retaliation. I presume Nakhang action falls in that category.</p>
                        <p>4. However, unless North Vietnamese are prepared pump a few more
                            battalions into this sector, I would expect attacking force would <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0476"/>gradually retire under pressure
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> reinforcements now being brought
                            to the scene.</p>
                        <p>5. As far as action in other sectors concerned, there is not much new.
                            Rumors persist of large enemy units moving towards Bolovens Plateau in
                            south, but none have yet been located. General <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> is conducting search operations
                            in area and one clear and hold operation without encountering major
                            resistance. However, I do not discount something happening here because
                            I think Communists actually believe US intends occupy the area and they
                            may wish activate some spoiling operations.</p>
                        <p>6. In far north, there is pressure on the Nam Ou Valley. North Vietnamese
                            used bombing pause to build up supplies at Dien Bien Phu, which lies at
                            head of Nam Ou Valley. A serious thrust down this valley could endanger
                            Luang Prabang, but it seems doubtful either Pathet Lao or North
                            Vietnamese forces in area are adequate for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>7. Finally, at Thathom in central Laos, there is an opportunity for enemy
                            exploitation because of weakness and demoralization of defending forces.
                            These are remnants of old <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            units and have no desire to fight under current leadership. They are
                            being rotated out and should be replaced in time to plug current
                            weaknesses there.</p>
                        <p>8. In general, I feel that any major enemy drives would have to involve
                            concentration of forces, which would then become vulnerable to air
                            attack. I believe our air resources are good enough to handle pretty
                            much of what we can foresee. Therefore, since the enemy is aware of
                            this, I would expect them to use their next two months for their annual
                            nibbling operation, during the course of which we will lose some
                            terrain.</p>
                        <p>9. During the monsoon season, we would expect to get back what we lose in
                            these two months and therefore, on balance, would expect the ground
                            situation in Laos to stay just about the way it has been over the last
                            couple of years.</p>

                                list covered the period January 15, 1965 to February 24, 1966. It
                                contained 13 incidents of U.S. air strikes against friendly targets
                                and 3 incidents of unauthorized attacks on enemy targets.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>These incidents are continuing to take place in spite of increasingly
                            stringent rules of engagement and I am sure that you share my concern
                            for the effect that this can have on our continued ability to operate in
                            Laos. After each incident Bill Sullivan must attempt to explain to the
                            Prime Minister what has happened and, in addition to the loss of life
                            and property damage to innocent persons, we have to consider the problem
                            of the loyalty of Lao military units and the continuation of the loyalty
                            of villagers to <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>.
                            While appreciating the problems of the pilots engaged in these
                            operations and the risks to which they are subjected, I deeply feel that
                            we should most urgently search for some way of at least sharply reducing
                            these unfortunate and costly mistakes so that their continuation does
                            not jeopardize our larger interests. I would appreciate any action that
                            can be taken to this end or suggestions that you may have on how we can
                            be of help.</p>

                        <p>978. 1. Because of increased enemy pressure against Neutralist positions
                            near Phou Kout, there is an immediate threat to the vital installation
                            at Muong Soui. A loss of Muong Soui would be disastrous because of its
                            key position leading into the approaches to Route 13. It would also
                            cause considerable complications because of the Thai artillery unit
                            stationed there.</p>
                        <p>2. Souvanna has reviewed this situation with his military commanders and
                            has concluded (as we have known all along) that the safety of Muoung
                            Soui requires the capture of Phou Kout. He therefore asked me to use
                            napalm to clean out enemy positions which are deeply entrenched on Phou
                            Kout so that Neutralist troops can capture it.</p>
                        <p>3. My Attaches have reviewed assault plans with the Neutralist commander,
                            Colonel Sing, and have concluded that he has a feasible proposal for the
                            operation. It is scheduled to kick off at 1000 hours Monday March
                            14.</p>
                        <p>4. We have made arrangements with 2AD to provide adequate <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> strike planes, with napalm, to
                            accomplish the objective. There is to be no publicity.<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">In telegram 586 to Vientiane, March 11, the

                                for the assault offered good prospects for success, napalm was

                                that “we are facing a severe case of galloping blue funk among the
                                Neutralists” which could endanger the Muong Soui region. According
                                to the Embassy, the problem was the chaotic situation among the
                                Neutralists and the virtual abdication of authority by <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>. It was compounded by minor
                                but sharp military reserves suffered by the Neutralists,
                                notwithstanding the fact that they had the enemy outnumbered,
                                outgunned, and they held the better ground. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. In course of day, we have taken several actions in effort restore
                            morale and effectiveness of units defending Muong Soui. Current
                            situation at Muong Soui itself is calm and our people on spot report
                            that troops are somewhat less nervous today.</p>
                        <p>2. Most important contribution today has been effective series of sorties
                            by <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>, both in immediate vicinity
                            Muong Soui front lines at Phou Kout and also among supply depots further
                            east in <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. Additionally, we have finally gotten General Staff to focus seriously
                            on problem and to begin deployment of additional <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> forces to the area for a coordinated <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>-Neutralist defense plan. <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> will report further on this.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, I saw Souvanna this afternoon, got his approval on an overall
                            air operations plan for the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> and
                            encouraged him to stimulate more action by his forces. He had already
                            called in <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> and sent him to
                            Muong Soui (for whatever good that will do) and has given orders for
                            extensive patrolling north and south of defensive positions.</p>
                        <p>5. He asked me for additional reconnaissance by O–1 type aircraft north
                            of Muong Soui to track down reports that enemy units are approaching
                            down Nam Khan Valley. We are in touch with Dep Com 2AD to fulfill this
                            request.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: Souvanna was considerably depressed
                            and obviously not very confident about abilities of his Neutralist
                            unity. Perhaps a few days of successful air operations will help restore
                            his bounce.</p>

                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>) In the sense that the incidents
                            noted in the letter of the Deputy Under Secretary of State do occur from
                            time to time, it is agreed that the cumulative total has continued to
                            grow.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) All military echelons are
                            concerned over incidents involving inadvertent delivery of ordnance on
                            friendly forces or noncombatants, in Laos or elsewhere. They are also
                            concerned over casualties being inflicted by the communists on both
                            military and civilians in the war in South Vietnam, which must now be
                            recognized as amongst the more intensive armed conflicts in which this
                            country has engaged. Our air strike operations in Laos are a necessary
                            and integral part of that war. Despite precautions taken by responsible
                            military at all levels, often at the cost of added risk to their own
                            lives, it is a lesson of history that there will be some casualties
                            amongst noncombatants in a war zone; no feasible restrictions or rules
                            of procedure can guarantee against this. A deeply regrettable fact of
                            the war must therefore be acknowledged, that the cumulative total of the
                            incidents noted will probably continue to grow.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) It should be noted, however, that
                            although the cumulative number of mishaps has grown somewhat during the
                            past six months, there has been a substantial downward trend in the
                            incident rate. This rate is considered to afford the most meaningful
                            indication of the degree of effectiveness of the intensive
                            countermeasures taken. As illustrated in the enclosure, Joint Staff
                            records indicate the incident rate per thousand combat sorties in Laos
                            has been reduced from about 5.0 during the first quarter calendar year
                            1965 to approximately 0.14 at present, a thirty-five-fold
                            improvement.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. There seems to be little evidence to support Souvanna's view, as
                            expressed reftel, that Hanoi's primary objective in its current
                            aggressive military action in northern Laos is to threaten Laos so
                            severely that it will “draw in” American ground forces. If their aim
                            were provocation, there would seem to be more direct actions they could
                            take. For example, <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> troops would have
                            no real difficulty in destroying Thakhek or another town on the Mekong,
                            an action Hanoi must assume would bring about some kind of American
                            response. We assume on the contrary that Hanoi wants to avoid actions
                            that might bring about the deployment of American ground forces, that it
                            will probably restrict its actions to what is considered acceptable
                            under current ground rules and that its present objectives in the north
                            are motivated at least as much by political as military
                            considerations.</p>
                        <p>2. Hanoi's current offensive in the north has been made possible only as
                            a result of key decisions and actions made months ago, including a
                            decision to expand its logistic operations. It has long diverted far
                            more supplies and trucking, if not troops, for military operations in
                            northern Laos than are required merely to hold its own and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> positions. The decisions that lay behind
                            this considerable effort were probably based on a variety of
                            considerations, some of which might be the following:</p>
                        <p>A. Hanoi wants to show that it can still call the shots in northern Laos.
                            As a result of both Lao and American air action in 1964 and 1965,
                            limited as it was, <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces were at first unable to take
                            effective action against friendly positions in the north. Meo and <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> troops in fact were able to make modest
                            advances and strengthened their enclaves in enemy territory. Hanoi may
                            have concluded that the increased relative strength of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and Meo forces, the determined Meo
                            attack against Hua Muong, stepped up air action and some boastful Lao
                            talk presaged a serious effort to dislodge VNA and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces from key positions in the north.
                            It was time to give the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and Souvanna
                            a hard lesson. Hanoi then took steps to counteract the effects of air
                            harassment through an improved road network and increased trucking of
                            supplies and resumed its former practice of taking the offensive against
                            friendly positions during the dry <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0482"/>season. They have by now dislodged friendly forces from
                            most of the positions north of the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss>
                            which were taken since the summer of 1964.</p>
                        <p>B. As a corollary to A above, Hanoi probably wishes to demonstrate
                            forcibly to Souvanna that no amount of American intervention short of
                            deployment of US troops, if even that, can prevent <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> military successes whenever Hanoi
                            chooses to take the offensive. Hanoi may regard an impressive series of
                            victories in northern Laos, even though limited in scope, as a means of
                            raising doubt in Souvanna's mind about the utility of his American
                            support. Souvanna's proposed trip to Moscow will doubtless give Hanoi
                            further incentive to keep up the pressure.</p>
                        <p>C. The <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>, which is discredited as a
                            political movement, probably put heavy pressure on Hanoi to sustain its
                            military and political position. The <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            needed several strong shots in the arm, and Hanoi could not afford to
                            allow further weakening of a movement that has been so useful to its
                            expansionist objectives.</p>
                        <p>D. Continued <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> military successes can
                            badly demoralize the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and Neutralists
                            armies. Hanoi would probably hope exploit such demoralization through
                            political offensives.</p>
                        <p>3. We ourselves would not expect Hanoi this year at least to press its
                            military advances much beyond the Plain of Jars area and into key
                            valleys and routes that lead into it from the north, east and south. At
                            this point operations carried <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> to the
                            west to their main bases might impose serious logistics problem for
                                <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> troops. Nevertheless we believe
                            they could attempt push to this junction of Routes 13 and 7 if they are
                            prepared to pay a heavy price, and <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>
                            forces might be able carry out operations which could become a threat to
                            Luang Prabang, e.g., a push down the Nam Hou from Dien Bien Phu.</p>
                        <p>4. At any rate, one lesson from <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>
                            actions in northern Laos is by now clear. Whether or not the North
                            Vietnamese choose to move further in northern Laos they have already
                            demonstrated they are willing and able to mount an impressive logistics
                            and offensive operation in the face of air and guerrilla harassment in a
                            theater that has no direct connection with their main military efforts
                            in South Vietnam. Thus far, of course, our air attacks in the north have
                            largely been only harassment. We have until this week avoided out of
                            political consideration such key supply areas as Ban Liang (because of
                            its proximity to Khang Khay). But heavy and frequent attacks against
                            such targets and stepped up armed recce and inter- diction in the <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> area should make it much more costly and
                            difficult for Hanoi to maintain an offensive, which, limited as it might
                            be, poses a serious threat to the political and military stability of
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, if friendly forces and positions survive dry season
                            relatively intact, we still hope they will be able recover some recently
                            lost terrain during the monsoon.</p>

                        <p>1. Believe use of Napalm will enhance effectiveness of strikes against
                            targets in Lao Panhandle and provide increased flexibility for US
                            tactical air operations in Laos. We also believe that Napalm should be
                            provided <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> for use at General
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>'s discretion as you
                            suggested.</p>
                        <p>2. To maximize effectiveness against infiltration-related targets and
                            simultaneously to ensure maximum safeguards against inadvertent strikes
                            on Laos civilians (i.e., prevent use against villages and huts,
                            inhabited areas or civilians) and friendly troops, use of Napalm should
                            be integrated into well-established procedures for <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> operations currently in effect in Steel
                            Tiger area. While it is appreciated that initially limiting the use of
                            Napalm to newly proposed <gloss target="#t_ShinningBrass1">Shinning
                                Brass</gloss> area might have some advantage, this limitation could
                            cause operational difficulty by establishment of still another boundary,
                            within relatively small operating area, involving another set of
                            operating rules.</p>
                        <p>3. Accordingly, if Souvanna concurs,<note n="4" xml:id="d227fn4">In

                        <p>1054. 1. If I were to choose any one word to characterize the situation
                            in this country on the eve of Lao new year, I would suggest the word
                            “fatigue.”</p>
                        <p>2. The Prime Minister is tired, the members of his government are tired,
                            the Royal Army is tired, the Neutralists are tired,<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">In telegram 1039 from Vientiane, March 31, the
                                Embassy reported that Neutralist morale was continuing “to plummet.”
                                Infantry Battalion Eight near Phou Kout abandoned its positions and
                                asked to be airlifted to its headquarters. <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> refused to intervene in the
                                affair. (Ibid., POL 27 LAOS)</note> and (according to our
                            information) the Pathet Lao are tired. This condition is partly the
                            result of the current enervating and oppressive heat which precedes the
                            rains and partly because we had no winter to speak of this year. But,
                            primarily, it is because of the long, exhausting conflict which has been
                            the fate of Laos for the past ten years.</p>
                        <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0485"/>
                        <p>3. The Prime Minister took off for Tokyo this morning to attend the
                            conference on Southeast Asian development. Before his departure, I had
                            our Embassy doctor give him a couple of vitamin injections to perk him
                            up a bit. However, he won't gain much zest unless he can get a little
                            relaxation on his visit to Japan. He has agreed to take a few days'
                            rest, and I have attempted to persuade Japanese Ambassador (who will be
                            accompanying him) to be sure he is not overwhelmed with hospitality.</p>
                        <p>4. The Royal Army is going to have to hang on in its current dispositions
                            until the rains come. Then, there are plans to rotate units out of the
                            front lines, give them some R and R, and to re-form and re-equip them,
                            before sending them back into action.</p>
                        <p>5. As for the Neutralists, this is a sticky question. They see no future
                            for themselves, yet they do not wish to merge their identity with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and certainly have no intention
                            to defect to the Communists. The enemy is quite aware of the
                            demoralization among the Neutralists and Radio Peking is already crowing
                            about it. The Neutralists are currently (and for this reason) the prime
                            focus of Viet attacks in Laos. Their fate is quite definitely in the
                            balance.</p>
                        <p>6. The Pathet Lao, as a fighting force, were just about washed up a few
                            months ago. They have been revived by the introduction of additional new
                            Vietnamese cadre and fighting units. How long this new injection of
                            energy will last is anyone's guess, but it is doubtful that it will
                            really survive the rainy season.</p>
                        <p>7. The sixty-four dollar question, in all this evaluation, is the state
                            of affairs among the North Vietnamese. Starting from the assumption that
                            they are human, we can only suspect that they, too, are feeling the
                            strain. Captured prisoners, recovered diaries, and other evidence bear
                            out this supposition. But the nature of their continued thrust, the
                            vigor of their new invasion give us small comfort that we are anywhere
                            near in sight of a collapse.</p>
                        <p>8. We must, however, take some notice of the fact that, as a whole, the
                            human fabric of this constant conflict is beginning to fray. Nothing is
                            immediately critical. But it is all beginning to wear just a bit
                            thin.</p>
                        <p>9. Given these circumstances, it is difficult to predict reactions to any
                            particular situation. The best we can do is to lay in more vitamins,
                            look lively and pray for rain.</p>

                        <p>After the formal presentation of credentials the group moved to the
                            Treaty Room where the President and the Ambassador had a brief talk.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the President's query concerning the current situation in
                            Laos, the Ambassador said that when he left there were no political
                            problems and there had been practically none over the past year.
                            However, the recent attacks by Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese forces in
                            the Attopeu area had worsened the military situation.</p>
                        <p>The President asked how Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> felt about the situation and the
                            Ambassador replied that the Prime Minister was very much encouraged by
                            the improvement in the political situation over the past two years, to
                            the extent of feeling optimistic about the future. Because the military
                            situation remained difficult he continued to rely on assistance from
                            friendly nations, and particularly from the U.S. in containing invasion
                            and aggression. The Ambassador added that both <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and the King were
                            following with apprehension the developments in Vietnam, as they were
                            fully aware of the repercussions on Laos of the unfortunate turn of
                            events in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that we were deeply distressed over the present
                            state of the Government of Vietnam, and that we hoped some measure of
                            stability might be attained. From a military standpoint, we were daily
                            increasing an already substantial commitment. There was no doubt that
                            the attitude of the Government of Vietnam regarding its political
                            stability would affect what we might do.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that Laos had been encouraged by the visits of the
                            Vice President and of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. He noted that both had given Laos assurances
                            of U.S. support and friendship. As a consequence <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0487"/>Laos felt more capable of defending and
                            safeguarding its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and
                            neutrality.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that he had received very good reports from both
                            the Vice President and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>. The Vice President had been anxious to include
                            Laos on his itinerary, to follow up on the contacts he had previously
                            made with Lao leaders. The Vice President was encouraged by the progress
                            he had noted.</p>
                        <p>The very cordial meeting ended with a friendly exchange of amenities.</p>

                                memorandum to McNamara, April 6, entitled “Combat Operations
                                Involving Laos.” (Ibid.)</note> which is now under consideration in
                            State and could come to your attention at any time. It does the
                            following:</p>
                        <p>(1) Reaffirmed the 7 January request that US ground forces be authorized
                            immediate pursuit into Laos and Cambodia (same paper asked authorization
                            for immediate pursuit into Chinese airspace).</p>
                        <p>(2) Pending approval of the above, requested authority to authorize
                            actions in self-defense against enemy attacks coming from Laos.</p>
                        <p>Immediate pursuit is already authorized for air action over Laos and
                            North Vietnam, and over Cambodia when actually engaged in combat. But
                            ground action is not authorized in any of these countries.</p>
                        <p>Immediate pursuit would permit US forces to move into neighboring
                            countries as far as necessary to oppose an enemy force that had attacked
                            them, as long as combat were continuous. The lesser request for actions
                            in self-defense against attacks from Laos would permit movement only as
                            long as US forces were in jeopardy.</p>

                        <p>Since the Laotian Government has previously authorized the bombing of

                            to let US troops fire into and maneuver within Laos. The Laotians
                            probably would want us to keep such troop movements secret, as in the
                            case of air actions. Since ground action is more likely to be directly
                            observed and reported by the press, the Laotian political reaction might
                            be more serious.</p>
                        <p>From past indications I would doubt that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> would be very disturbed about the
                            surfacing of an occasional ground action taken in self-defense. However,
                            paragraph 4 of the draft message would authorize attacks against Laotian
                            villages when the US commander felt they were necessary for the
                            preservation of his own forces, and Souvanna has been more sensitive
                            when it comes to attacks on villages.<note n="3" xml:id="d230fn3">In an

                                in emergencies and should be solely exercises in self-defense.

                        <p>1076. Reur 638.<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">In telegram 638 to Vientiane,
                                April 9, the Department of State asked for the Embassy's comments on
                                the proposed changes in rules of engagement for U.S. troops in Laos.
                                The Department suggested that should any operation become public
                                knowledge despite its tightly held security classification, U.S.
                                spokesmen would reply that American military commanders have
                                authority to take actions inherent in the right of self-defense to
                                protect their forces. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. As seems to be always the case with matters affecting Laos, the
                            problem re rules of engagement on the <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> border is not with the substance but with the shadow.
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> officials, in contrast to
                            Cambodians, would have no objection to hot pursuit across ill-defined
                            border by U.S. and friendly forces engaged with Viet Cong. However, they
                            would have great difficulty with a public assertion of our right or
                            intention to exercise such hot pursuit.</p>
                        <p>2. What bothers me therefore is precisely prospect raised in para 2
                            reftel that U.S. authority to undertake this pursuit would become public
                            knowledge, despite high security classification. Experience has
                            unhappily shown this to be true, no matter how much we may lament
                            it.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, since neither I nor <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            would in any way wish inhibit friendly forces from defending themselves
                            against attack from Lao territory, issue we must tackle is manner in
                            which public repercussions can be eliminated. I would submit that this
                            is not impossible, and that it can be handled in one of three different
                            ways.</p>
                        <p>4. First way would be to change rules of engagement and publish them
                            widely, albeit with high security classification. When inevitable leak
                            occurs, Spokesman should merely deny it flatly. I put up this suggestion
                            knowing full well it will not be accepted in Washington. However, it is
                            obviously the best and most logical choice. Yet I realize it remains an
                            unacceptable option.</p>
                        <p>5. Second way would be to change rules of engagement but not publish them
                            widely. In this context, I would suggest they be held at the <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> level, on an eyes-only
                            basis for a limited and specifically designated number of responsible
                            officers. These officers could then respond, in the event, to an
                            emergency by a field commander, giving him the authorization if and when
                            a situation like a [garble] develops into a cross-border fight. In this
                            option, I would prefer that the public line to be taken should differ
                            from Thai proposed reftel. If there is a leakage, the <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0490"/>answer to queries should be: “You are
                            posing a question on a hypothetical issue which has not arisen. We do
                            not answer hypothetical questions.”</p>
                        <p>6. The third way to handle the problem would be to take the decision at
                            the national level but refrain from publishing it in the field. In this
                            way, the actual change in rules of engagement would take place only when
                            and if a cross-border situation arose. Since, contrary to the Cambodian
                            situation, we are not faced with an immediate prospect of this type
                            attack, there would be no actual handicap to the troops. There would, of
                            course, be much continuing anguish among staff officers.</p>
                        <p>7. On balance, I suppose the second choice is the most practical. If and
                            when an actual situation occurs and cross-border hot pursuit becomes
                            necessary, then, at the point (but only then) would Spokesman fall back
                            on our standard line for operational matter, affecting Laos, which is
                            “no comment.” At no time would I foresee the necessity to go as far as
                            to assert “authority” publicly, as proposed reftel. We could, however,
                            if necessary, reaffirm our policy as outlined last sentence reftel.<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">The last sentence of telegram 638 reads: “In
                                addition spokesmen would reaffirm <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> policy to respect sovereignty, independence,
                                neutrality, and territory of Laos and not to widen war in Southeast
                                Asia.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>8. In general, I would feel it improvement to discuss this matter with
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. However, just in the event that
                            Washington should decide on some course of action from my current
                            expectations, I wish opportunity to comment again on this aspect when
                            you come to a consensus on the substance of your intentions.<note n="4" xml:id="d231fn4">In telegram 659 to Vientiane, April 23, the
                                Department informed the Embassy that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> would hold on an eyes only basis authorization to
                                operate in the Laos border area until needed. Should the Department
                                receive press inquiries, the response would be that the question was
                                hypothetical or “no comment,” as appropriate. If pressed, the
                                spokesman could say that Laos is an area in which American
                                commanders have self-defense authority. (Ibid.) In telegram 1116

                            his opposition to having the US “used” (by the offer of trips) to cover
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>'s removal from <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> command, and Souvanna has agreed that
                            Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> would “still be in charge”
                            of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> “when he returned”. This
                            may not go far enough. Based on present knowledge, it seems to me that
                            we should urge Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> to seek to persuade Souvanna and Ouan not to

                            his return from travel to the US. My own judgment is that this is a

                        <p>On the military side, I do not believe that a ground force commander
                            should assume command of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> or
                            that Gen. Sourith is the one to try it if it were a good idea. Some

                            traditional Lao ground commander on the spirited <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> jockeys of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            would be a sure step toward diminished morale and military
                            effectiveness. Numerous activities of the US seem to depend on the
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> remaining sufficiently
                            operational to justify <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support and
                            the other assistance we have provided to it. We should not run the risk
                            of upsetting a working arrangement, if we can help Souvanna avoid it,
                            unless there are compelling collateral advantages. I do not see any,
                            except that the change would help Gen. Ouan and the
                                <persName>Sananikone</persName>s to consolidate their control of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>. Whether this is desirable is
                            more a political than a military judgment.</p>
                        <p>Because the desire to remove <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> is
                            of long standing, I find it hard not to believe that it fits into a
                            pattern of <persName>Sananikone</persName> actions against <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and Khamkhong and of inaction
                            vis-à-vis <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> and Kong Le
                            that seem to me to account in part for recent and cumulative severe
                            reverses in the northeast. If <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>
                            goes, Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk Somly</persName> may well
                            be next on the list. The Sananikones will then be able to concentrate
                            single-mindedly on management of the central Mekong valley area that
                            appears to be about as far as their strategic vision extends. I doubt
                            that their interest in effective control would long be limited to the
                            military sphere without taking on a political character, raising
                            questions about the stability of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>There is no assurance that a restatement of our confidence in Ma will
                            save him from the rockpile. And the best course of action in Laos
                            usually seems to be to let the Lao go their own way, at least after
                            obligating them to consider all aspects of a contemplated decision. This
                            does seem one instance, however, when in the US interest some
                            representations should be made</p>

                        <p>It has been consistently reported by all appropriate American observers
                            since mid-1963 (when the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> went
                            “operational”) that among the Lao it is Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and he alone who makes the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> go. He has significant known weaknesses (fits of
                            temper, inability to organize a <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0493"/>staff or delegate work or authority, excessive concentration on one
                            idea at a time, etc), and it is not to his credit that there is no
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> officer in sight to take his
                            place in the event of either a combat or a political accident:
                            Nevertheless, we must deal with the situation as it is, and it is hard
                            to escape the conclusion that Ma remains of central importance to the
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> and to the US.</p>
                        <p>A desire to unseat Gen. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>, because
                            he is too “independent” of Vientiane, has been expressed by Gen.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and other General
                            Staff sources off and on for some time. The revival of the idea appears
                            to have followed a recent visit to Gen. Ouan by the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> Chief of Staff, Col. Ou Neua.
                            Although there is unquestionably some basis for various charges leveled
                            by him against Ma, I am sure you will recall Ou Neua as one of the least
                            reliable, most fractious officers we had to deal with (notably as Wattay
                            airport commandant in 1962–3). He has been in and out of the neutralist
                            forces and various right-wing alignments and is known to be jealous of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>'s commanding stature as
                                <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> chief. It is unfortunate that
                            his testimony (alone, as far as we are informed) enabled Ouan to
                            persuade Souvanna that perhaps it is time to move Ma up and out of the
                            way.</p>
                        <p>One of the charges brought by Ou Neua, for example, is that <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> is “fixed “ on <gloss target="#t_T281">T–28</gloss> operations and neglects the transport
                            squadron. Probably there is some truth in this, but part of the
                            translation may be that Ma has cracked down on the use of <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> C–47s for the transportation of
                            relatives, cattle, and opium.</p>
                        <p>As to Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SDS1">Sourith</persName>, I have tapped
                            the recollections of Col. <persName corresp="#p_LCW1">William
                                Law</persName> and Lt. Col. Gibert Grout to fill out my own limited
                            knowledge. (Col. Grout has known him since 1958 and was the principal
                            point of contact with him during our period in Laos.) <persName corresp="#p_SDS1">Sourith</persName> has certain technical
                            qualifications:</p>
                        <p>a. is a French-trained pilot (but is not known to have qualified except
                            in liaison aircraft);</p>
                        <p>b. about 1958, he served as <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> Chief of
                            Army Aviation (but at that time it was a ground-oriented command
                            consisting of the paratroops and enough aircraft to move them,
                            occasionally);</p>
                        <p>c. he is presently attending the C&amp;GSC at Fort Leavenworth, and
                            is reported to be cooperative, popular with fellow students, and a “fair
                            student” with some language problem.</p>
                        <p>This appears to be about the extent of his military qualifications for
                            the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> command.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SDS1">Sourith</persName> began his service in the
                            French Army, where at one time he was sergeant-aide to a recent French
                            Assistant Military Attaché (well known to you) who described his talents
                            as having been fully exploited in the aide capacity. He was directly
                            involved in the 1962 Nam Tha episode, making a record no better—though
                            no worse—than the other commanders concerned. After 1962, he remained as
                            CG, <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> I, keeping <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0494"/>himself aloof from Vientiane and the
                            General Staff. He was regarded by Gen. <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> as a “cipher,” though undoubtedly in part because
                            he was not responsive to <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>'s
                            interests. Col. Grout believes that he was sincerely devoted to helping
                            build the reputations of the King and Crown Prince out in the villages,
                            distinguishing himself more for a willingness to bat around in the
                            countryside than for the military activities that accompanied this
                            commendable stress on “nation-building”. He was dragged reluctantly into
                            Operation Triangle but, according to Col. <persName corresp="#p_LCW1">Law</persName>, did well once he got his battalions under way. He
                            has long seemed content to hold onto his fief in <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> I in collaboration with Gen. Norasing in <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> VI.</p>

                        <p>1. Defense has asked our concurrence in the attached draft message<note n="2" xml:id="d234fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> which would
                            establish rules of engagement for US forces operating in South Viet-Nam
                            near the Laos border, and authorize them to fire and maneuver into Laos
                            under circumstances of defense and preservation of forces, similar to
                            the rules in force for Cambodia.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>2. We believe that para 3 of the proposed new rules should be amended to
                            include a provision for requesting <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            approval in advance when planning operations near the <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>-Laos border. This procedure is
                            prescribed for operations involving Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>3. That section of the proposed new rules dealing with an emergency
                            situation (para 5) is in harmony with the authority presently in force
                            with respect to Cambodia except that in the case of Cambodia, US forces
                            are specifically prohibited from attacking Cambodian villages or
                            populated areas by air, by artillery fire or by ground forces. We
                            believe that the authority with respect to Laos should have the same
                            limitations.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> concurs in
                            principle with the proposed new rules. However, he is concerned with the
                            possibility of premature press leaks of this information and has agreed
                            to knowledge of this authority being held by General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> at <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> headquarters level only, pending a
                            possible requirement for its wider use. <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> (and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>)
                            stated the operational necessity of providing this information in
                            advance to at least the subordinate major field force commanders. We are
                            inclined to agree with <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            and the handling of this point as outlined in para 2 of the attached
                            revised rules and we do not consider it necessary to return to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> on this
                            point, since he is already aware of <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> views and has not dissented.</p>
                        <p>5. Pending the development of an actual requirement for use of this new
                            authority in Laos, we would respond to press inquiries that the <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0497"/>question is hypothetical or “no
                            comment”, as appropriate. If the authority is used and press queries are
                            made we would answer (as in the Cambodian case) by citing the inherent
                            right of self-defense.</p>

                                66.<note n="2" xml:id="d235fn2">In <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> telegram 030345Z, June 3, <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> if some of the
                                targets in the Laos Panhandle, such as truck parks or storage
                                facilities, were appropriate targets for tactical aircraft rather
                                than Arc Light bombing by <gloss target="#t_B52Statofortress1">B–52</gloss>'s. <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName>
                                was concerned about “obtaining more significant targets” and “a more
                                judicious expenditure of ordnance.” (Ibid.)</note> Subj: Arc
                            Light.</p>
                        <p>1. In response to reference, let me stress at the outset that I support
                            fully and enthusiastically the objective of obtaining optimum returns
                            per Arc Light sortie. Attainment of this objective entails detailed
                            consideration of two factors: the operational purpose to be served by a
                            given strike or a series of strikes, and the availability of timely,
                            reliable intelligence as the basis for target selection.</p>
                        <p>2. With regard to the operational purpose served by <gloss target="#t_B52Statofortress1">B–52</gloss> strikes in Laos, we see
                            the effort as one designed to assist in destroying an integrated enemy
                            logistic system associated with well-defined ground <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s. In a very real sense our tactical and
                            strategic air programs in the Laos Panhandle are directed against a
                            vital portion of the enemy's communication <pb n="466" xml:id="pg_466" facs="0498"/>zone. Far more than harassment of infiltration activity
                            is involved. Rather, we seek to identify and destroy storage depots,
                            staging areas, maintenance facilities, [illegible] points, truck parks,
                            bridge and ferry sites, control installations and road repair
                            capabilities.</p>
                        <p>3. As regards availability of timely, reliable intelligence as a basis
                            for targeting in Laos, we enjoy the benefit of a high order of <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> saturation of the area in question.
                            Rich dividends have been produced as a result of increasing <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> familiarity with the enemy's logistic
                            system and his pattern of activity associated with operation of the
                            system. The impressive <gloss target="#t_TigerHound1">Tiger
                                Hound</gloss> record in terms of trucks destroyed, secondary
                            explosions and structures destroyed is illustrative of effective
                            intelligence based largely on visual observation. Moreover, the fact
                            that the enemy has been operating overtly throughout his <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> network in southern Laos has afforded
                            us an intelligence advantage generally unknown in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. It is my considered judgment, in this
                            regard, that our targeting in Laos has been supported more generously by
                            effective intelligence than has the bulk of our targeting for <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. You have raised the question of how we might obtain more significant
                            targets for Arc Light strikes and more judicious expenditure of
                            ordnance. I know of but one solution to this problem; namely, periodic
                            review in depth of targeting status and procedures. This is an
                            undertaking in which I participate personally, the most recent instance
                            having occurred within the past several weeks. Coupled with the review
                            process must be command approval of each strike based on detailed
                            assessment of all factors, including intelligence. As you know, I
                            personally approve each Arc Light target as an outgrowth of this system.
                            It is for this reason that I am in a position to assure you that our
                            selection of these targets not only reflects maximum refinement of
                            available information, but takes full advantage of all assessment
                            techniques and targeting expertise available. Targets are competing for
                            selection based on the merits and supportability of the target and not
                            upon any preference for geographical division of effort.</p>

                        <p>It will be noted of the total strikes, only about 20 percent have been
                            directed against targets in Laos. Commitment of resources against these
                            targets has on no occasion been at the expense of more lucrative targets
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. Based on the foregoing, it is recommended that our present approach to
                            Arc Light targeting be continued. In light of experience gained to date,
                            I am satisfied that it best supports the objective of obtaining optimum
                            returns per sortie.</p>

                        <p>1306. 1. I called on Souvanna and King separately this morning to obtain
                            their impressions of recent Royal visit to Soviet Union.<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">May 16–17.</note> Their impressions differ slightly
                            and are reported below in general outline.</p>
                        <p>2. Souvanna said that, although there had been more sightseeing than
                            serious exchanges of view, they nevertheless had been able to get some
                            points across. He said that they were accompanied on entire trip by
                            Zhukov, Secretary General of Foreign Office, and former Ambassador to
                            China. He described him as well-informed and obviously sent along to
                            talk substance.</p>
                        <p>3. He said their conversations had been quite specific, concerning
                            detailed accusations by the Pathet Lao, etc., and they in turn had been
                            specific with respect to North Vietnamese actions, etc. He said King had
                            been quite forceful in presenting Laotian viewpoint.</p>
                        <p>4. However, despite these details, Souvanna had no impression of Soviet
                            policy precision. He said he felt Soviets were engaged in study of their
                            policy towards Lao and it was probably being reviewed with Soviet <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0500"/>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName>, who remaining in Moscow
                            until end of the month. He expected that when <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName> returned he would bring
                            more precision with him.</p>
                        <p>5. King, on other hand, told me he considered Soviet policy was already
                            quite precise. He said he had held long private talk with Podgorny
                            without presence of Souvanna. He pointed out delicately that, since this
                            was conversation between two chiefs of state, it was “privileged” and he
                            could not give me details. However, he would like to make one
                            observation.</p>
                        <p>6. He said he had read President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s Memorial Day speech and was struck by the fact
                            that what President said coincided with what Podgorny said in two
                            important particulars: (a) desire not to enlarge the war, and (b) desire
                            to avoid damage to other U.S./<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            relations. He considered these perhaps the two most important
                            points.</p>
                        <p>7. He then said that, if he were to draw the balance of his impressions
                            of Soviet policy with respect to United States policy in Southeast Asia,
                            he would advise the President to “just keep doing exactly what you are
                            doing now,” and U.S. will obtain its objectives. He felt that Hanoi was
                            becoming disillusioned with Peking and that the two major points of
                            coincidence of U.S. and Soviet policy would fix the pattern of a
                            settlement in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>3. The proposed expansion into Phase II would authorize exploitation
                            operations by specially trained platoon size Nung units accompanied by
                            not over 3 US advisors in each instance. Each operation would be limited
                            to approximately 5 days and the penetration into Laos limited to 10
                            kilometers (east of the red line on the map at Tab B). The normal ground
                            rules for these type operations with respect to deniability would be
                            observed, i.e. altered maps would be used and the teams briefed that the
                            operations are conducted only in RVN. Phase I operations would continue
                            with their present limitations.</p>
                        <p>4. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> concurs in
                            the operations as proposed to include a 48-hour advance notice of intent
                            to launch an operation. This would amount to a confirmation of an
                            operation shown in the monthly schedule published by <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> (the first exploitation operation,
                            scheduled for June 10, is in abeyance pending Washington approval of the
                            concept).</p>
                        <p>5. We believe the proposal to be reasonable in view of the restrictions
                            of time and distance, size of forces, and deniability precautions.
                            However, so that we may monitor the program (and veto if necessary), the
                            Department should also be an addressee of the 48-hour advance
                            notification of intent to launch an operation.</p>

                        <p>1371. 1. Visit by Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> June 24–26 provided excellent opportunity take
                            pulse of Lao body politic in perspective of nineteen-month interval
                            since he left Vientiane. During visit he held discussions with broadly
                            representative cross-section of power elite, highlights of which follow.
                            Big disappointment was weather, which closed in over Luang Prabang for
                            three successive days and forced cancelation of audience with King
                                <persName corresp="#p_SV1">Savang</persName> and luncheon with Crown
                            Prince. Hastily substituted visit to <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>-assisted cluster villages at Banyeun in northern
                            Vientiane plain was also almost washed out by untimely rains.</p>
                        <p>2. All Lao whom he consulted were unanimous in over-all assessment that
                            there has been steady improvement on political, economic, and military
                            fronts in past year and half. Principal factors cited were (A) ouster of
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName> and of disruptive and corrupt
                            influence in government which they represented; (B) return to
                            constitutional forms with election of new National Assembly; (C) steady
                            economic gains, highlighted by continuing success of stabilization
                            program, multilateral undertaking to finance Nam Ngum hydro-electric
                            project, and visible spread of government services (<gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>-sponsored) to countryside; (D)
                            growing effectiveness of air strikes and other military and
                            psychological pressures against enemy forces; and (E) increasing Pathet
                            Lao and dissident neutralist defections to friendly forces (from 140 in
                            February to 400 in May). He found, in sum, atmosphere of restrained
                            optimism about internal affairs and also about external situation with
                            Allied military successes in South Vietnam sustaining conviction that
                            North Vietnamese will eventually be brought to bay and <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> achieve some semblance of peace and
                            prosperity.</p>
                        <p>3. Against this background of relative contentment and moderate progress,
                            Lao nevertheless showed themselves preoccupied with usual set of
                            internal problems.</p>
                        <p>A. There is strengthening conviction that present government, although
                            composed of able men, is spread too thin, and there is general
                            expectation that Souvanna on his return in late July from France will
                            face concerted pressures to enlarge his cabinet, perhaps himself
                            relinquishing <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0503"/>one or more
                            portfolios. Unresolved question is whether he can find truly qualified
                            candidates outside of ranks of portfolio-hungry but not very able
                            deputies such as Assembly President <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Oudom
                                Souvannavong</persName>, said to relish portfolio of Minister of
                            Health or of Foreign Affairs; Serc Volavongsa, who seeks Ministry of
                            Public Works; and Khampha Sackda, candidate for now vacant position of
                            Secretary of State for Finance. Souvanna is undoubtedly wise to keep
                            this Pandora's box closed for as long as he can.</p>
                        <p>B. Assembly deputies are already exercised that their two-year term
                            expires next year. Min Justice Inpeng Suryadhay (himself a deputy) is at
                            work on proposal that King extend term of present deputies from two to
                            five years, which is normal span of service specific in constitution.
                            Few give this proposal much chance of success against expected
                            opposition of King <persName corresp="#p_SV1">Savang</persName>, who
                            personally endorsed two-year term. Another proposal, advanced by
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName>
                            <persName>Sananikone</persName>, is that King let this Assembly pass
                            into oblivion and exercise his constitutional power to appoint entirely
                            new Assembly. <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> would vastly
                            prefer this appointive process to either restricted or general elections
                            in context of a divided Laos. Since Souvanna is apparently only mildly
                            concerned at anxieties of deputies over their future, this problem is
                            likely to lie fallow at least until late fall as far as he is
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>C. Souvanna is increasingly preoccupied, however, with problem of
                            national unity against Neo Lao Hak Xat. He suggested to <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> June 26 that <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> accept mandate to establish “union
                            of parties” in National Assembly, which we take to mean a national front
                            incorporating all conservative factions and Neutralists. Union of this
                            sort, while eminently desirable, would have to be based on a meeting of
                            minds between Souvanna and Prince Boun Oum, and until that occurs,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> sees no useful role for
                            himself in project. Mere fact, however, that Souvanna sees diminishing
                            value in maintenance of separate Neutralist Party underlines evolution
                            of his thought over past several years. If he could achieve political
                            merger of Neutralists with conservatives into national front (while
                            preserving status of neutrality for Laos), way would be eased to
                            unification of Neutralist armed forces with <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and to greater military as well as political
                            efficiency. Unification of armed forces is also objective which General
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith Abhay</persName> has very much
                            in mind.</p>
                        <p>D. Perhaps because of generally favorable security situation and low
                            level of enemy activity, military concerns did not loom large during
                            talks. <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> said that
                            Lao/Viet may well seek establish fortress base on Bolivens Plateau if
                            pressures continue to mount on their positions in corridor and in South
                            Vietnam. He also anticipates increased enemy rice foraging activity in
                            Panhandle during next dry season. On other hand, he believes friendly
                            guerrilla, conventional, and air operations <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0504"/>against enemy in northern Laos are likely to keep him
                            off balance, and a relatively minor threat there, for some time.</p>
                        <p>4. Visit reaffirmed that Souvanna continues to be central authority on
                            whom all important decisions devolve. He is being roundly criticized by
                            many of his ministers, in particular Vice Premier Leuam Insisienmay, for
                            his failure to consult them on major decisions such as fate of <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>. Yet despite his short-comings he remains firmly
                            entrenched in premiership and showed no signs of wanting out. Visits of
                            several foreign personalities to Laos during past week (<persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, Lord Walston, Australian Minister
                            Fraser, British Conservative MP Royle) as well as expected visit of
                                Sainteny<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2">Jean Sainteny, former Delegate
                                General of France to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.</note> have
                            probably buoyed his spirits. Also, he can look forward to being in
                            France from July 7 to 24 and subsequently to attending <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in autumn. His visit to
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has in no way altered his
                            belief that maximum military pressures must be exerted against Hanoi,
                            and while he would strongly resist entry of foreign friendly forces into
                            Laos, he is equally strong advocate of intensified air strikes against
                            NVN.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> will undoubtedly have much
                            to add to this from his personal impressions. Our own conclusion is that
                            visit was highly successful, providing occasion for Lao themselves to
                            reflect on strides they have made since February 1965 rebellion and to
                            look ahead to future with some confidence.</p>

                                Sullivan</persName> who was in Washington on home leave and
                            consultations, made a call on the Honorable <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John T. McNaughton</persName>, <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0505"/>Assistant Secretary of Defense (<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), at 1600 hours, 28 June 1966. In attendance were Rear
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BRAFJ1">F.J. Blouin</persName>, Director,
                            Far East Region, OASD(<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), Colonel J.H.
                            Mobley, Staff Assistant for Laos, OASD(<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>), and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SRF1">Robert F.

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> reviewed the
                            situation in Laos saying that improvements in the situation in Vietnam
                            are assisting in keeping Laos quiet. He stated that the economic trend
                            in Laos is favorable. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> believed that there were hopeful signs that
                            with continued US economic aid, in accordance with the prescription in
                            the President's Johns Hopkins speech,<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">For
                                text of the speech, April 7, 1965, see American Foreign Policy:
                                Current Documents, 1965, pp. 848–852.</note> Laos can eventually
                            become economically independent and viable. To Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, this represented a changed
                            attitude from that of a year ago when he was far less optimistic about
                            the economic future of Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> that he understood from previous discussions
                            that a proposal had been made to transfer Laos military assistance from
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> to the Services. He said that he
                            favored this proposal on condition that the sensitivity and
                            classification of the Laos program be maintained in the presentation of
                            Service budgets and in the implementation of the program by the
                            Services.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> and the Ambassador
                            opined that there will be some opposition in the Congress to the
                            proposed transfer of Laos/Thailand programs from <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, particularly Thailand. Senator Fulbright was mentioned
                            as being potentially the chief opponent.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> discussed the
                            present organizational structure for military assistance in Laos whereby
                            US military assistance in Laos is accomplished by the Requirements
                            Office of <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>. He desired to
                            preserve this organization, since it is considered necessary to abide by
                            the Geneva Accords. A type organization in Thailand (currently <gloss target="#t_DEPCHJUSMAG1">DEPCHJUSMAG</gloss> Thailand) was also
                            believed by the Ambassador to be important to the continued support of
                            the Laos program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. NcNaughton asked what the Lao attitude would be on a “barrier” across
                            Laos to stop the infiltration into <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.
                            The Ambassador responded by saying that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> would not condone
                            presence of US or other foreign troops and would quit thereby destroying
                            the neutral posture of tri-partite structure of the Lao Government which
                            has existed since the Geneva Accords of 1962. He thought that turmoil
                            would ensue and the war in Laos would be intensified. He believed that
                            the Soviets would withdraw their current support and tacit approval for
                            the Royal Lao Government and would probably resume <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0506"/>support and military assistance for
                            Prince <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>,
                            the Pathet Lao leader. The Ambassador pointed out that no materiel
                            assistance from the Soviets is now being given to the Pathet Lao. This
                            would, in his opinion, encourage increased support of the Pathet Lao
                            from North Vietnam and eventually result in a full-scale invasion and
                            over-running of all of Laos by the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
                            forces, perhaps with the support of Communist China. In any event, a
                            “barrier” would result in giving all Lao territory north of it to the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> which would arouse violent
                            objection from the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">

                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he understood six divisions would be required
                            to establish a “barrier.” While Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has said that he would
                            not approve of the presence of US forces in Laos, he has concurred in US
                            activities and operations in Laos. These are the type which are deniable
                            and which do not arouse strenuous opposition from the Soviets and the
                            Chinese Communists. The Ambassador feels that we are now walking a thin
                            wire of tolerance of these activities and operations by the Soviets and
                            Chinese Communists, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> remarked that he exercised close control over
                            US personnel in Laos and could, if necessary, cause their removal in a
                            very short period of time.</p>
                        <p>Rather than employ forces in Laos to form a “barrier,” the Ambassador
                            reaffirmed his previously stated proposal for launching an operation
                            against NVN from the sea in the vicinity of Vinh.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> revealed his
                            dissatisfaction of US tactical bombing in Laos which concentrates in the
                            lower Panhandle rather than in the area of Laos near the Mu Gia Pass. He
                            believed that an intensification of bombing in this area will be
                            effective in destroying North Vietnamese personnel and materiel at their
                            most vulnerable point, i.e., immediately after crossing the Mu Gia Pass
                            into Laos. The Ambassador said he intended to make this point with the
                            Secretary of Defense, as well as with the Joint Chiefs of Staff when he
                            meets with them on Friday, 1 July.<note n="4" xml:id="d239fn4">No record

                            conclusion that Laos has made steady improvement on political, economic,
                            and military fronts in past year and half.</p>
                        <p>A. Although country remains divided and at war, it has enjoyed relative
                            political stability under leadership of neutralist PriMin <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>.</p>
                        <p>B. His armed forces have extended security deep into countryside,
                            permitting programs of rural development to make surprising strides in
                            bringing roads, schools, dispensaries, and agricultural services to Lao
                            villagers.</p>
                        <p>C. Under a multilaterally financed program of currency stabilization,
                            value of money has remained relatively stable, allowing urban
                            construction and development to proceed in an atmosphere of increasing
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>D. Despite strains imposed by defense of its territory against North
                            Vietnamese supported subversion and aggression, <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> has been able to focus increasing efforts on problems
                            of long range economic development. It is taking measures to enhance
                            rice production. It is member of Asian Development Bank. It has
                            concluded agreement with <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> looking
                            toward construction, under international financing, of the Nam Ngum
                            hydro-electric project in period 1967–1971. This project, part of
                            over-all multilateral development plans for lower Mekong Basin, will
                            irrigate significant area of Vientiane Plain and will provide needed
                            electric power to Laos and neighboring Thailand. It is outstanding
                            example of international support for regional development in SE Asia and
                            of international confidence in <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and
                            its future.</p>
                        <p>2. Although end of fighting is not in sight, <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> takes increasing pride in its capacity to contain and
                            to thwart Pathet Lao/NVN aggression and subversion. Armed forces,
                            greatly abetted by a small but efficient tactical air force, have
                            generally good morale and are being by and large efficiently deployed.
                            Defections from enemy ranks have steadily increased during past six
                            months. Refugees continue to flee from enemy held territory
                            strategically situated Meo and other minority peoples increasingly
                            identify their future with that of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>3. Begin <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> leaders remain publicly neutral in accordance with
                            their 1962 statement BF neutrality. They have openly condemned, however,
                            NVN violation of that neutrality and privately regard NVN as principal
                            source their troubles. They are therefore profoundly aware that their
                            future is intimately linked with course of war in RVN and have gone so
                            far as privately to authorize unpublicized actions by allied forces
                            against enemy forces in Lao territory. They have taken particular
                            encouragement from evident determination of US and its allies to remain
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, and that firmness of purpose,
                            although never publicly acknowledged by <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> spokesman, has more than any other single factor
                            persuaded them that their future is not unreliably bleak. End <gloss target="#t_FYI1">FYI</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. In sum, over past eighteen months there has been moderate progress in
                            Laos which is all the more encouraging since it has been achieved
                            against great odds.</p>

                                Controllers (FACs) to direct strikes by attack aircraft against
                                promising targets. Rapid assaults on targets was possible because of
                                instantaneous communication between airborne FACs and <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> headquarters.</note> is being
                            touted at Department level as the cure-all for our interdiction efforts

                        <p>2. This operation has been most effective and shows a sound potential for
                            achieving even more success in the future. However, the tasks facing <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0509"/>us in interdicting the
                            principal lines of communication along the Ho Chi Minh Trail challenge
                            us to combine and apply all our assets to that end. There is no question
                            of competition between the use of strategic bombing forces and tactical
                            air but only their appropriate application. The devastation and
                            psychological effect achieved by B–52 bombing makes it the most
                            effective and efficient weapons system available for striking area
                            targets. Further, it frees tactical air for use in Cricket and Tiger
                            Hound as well as for explanation of Arc Light results.</p>
                        <p>3. Our nominations of Arc Light targets in Laos have been for the purpose
                            of attacking a complete <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>
                            system—ration and ammunition dumps, way stations, maintenance areas,

                            these resources. It is considered essential, therefore, that the B–52
                            weapon system be employed in our endeavors in Laos.</p>

                        <p>We are faced with a serious problem in connection with reporting U.S.
                            casualties suffered in operations in and over Laos. Although we have
                            claimed total accuracy in the reporting of our casualties from Southeast
                            Asia, which is true for next of kin, actually we have not told the
                            general public of all of our casualties incurred in Laos. In the case of
                                <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0511"/>deaths, <gloss target="#t_MIA1">MIA</gloss>, and detained personnel, next of kin
                            are notified of the casualty, where the casualty occurred, and the known
                            circumstances. We reply accurately to specific press queries as to
                            whether a specific individual was killed or lost in Laos, but we do not
                            issue full statistics or lists of names of casualties.</p>
                        <p>This question was raised in a background session of Thursday, May 5, on
                            an off-the-record basis (transcript at Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">Attached but not printed.</note> We stated or at
                            least inferred at that time that Laotian casualties would be folded in
                            to our casualties report from Vietnam. We were, in fact, only talking
                            about combat deaths and at that time, in response to persistent
                            inquiries, had made a special release of the total number of such deaths
                            incurred since the beginning of our Laotian requested reconnaissance
                            sorties in Laos—11.</p>
                        <p>Based on conversations with the Deputy Secretary, I assumed that I had
                            authority to fold such deaths in to our weekly statistical casualty
                            reports to the press. However, the Directorate for Statistical Services,
                            OASD (Comptroller) did not agree, and the deaths have not been included.
                            I should add that until now this has not caused difficulty, since the
                            “Pentagon Regulars” understand our problem and have pushed us only
                            mildly on the matter.</p>
                        <p>It is possibly just as well that the action was deferred since the
                            problem is more difficult than appeared at that time. For example, we
                            have neither announced nor confirmed the 11 servicemen killed in Laos
                            prior to the initiation of our reconnaissance flights, nor have we said
                            anything specific concerning wounded, missing, or captured personnel.
                            The entire problem should be addressed, not just the <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> portion.</p>
                        <p>What is at stake now is the credibility of the Department of Defense and
                            of the Administration as a whole. We have been accused recently of not
                            telling the whole story with respect to all our Southeast Asia combat
                            casualties, and we cannot truthfully deny such accusations. To date, no
                            one of note has questioned this matter but we cannot hope to stay clear
                            of the problem indefinitely. I have discussed this matter at length with
                            the key members of my office and we are all agreed that we must face up
                            to it now or be subjected to great censure if some enterprising
                            journalist or politician digs into it.</p>
                        <p>There are several alternatives available:</p>
                        <p>1. Continue as we are at present, not announcing Laotian casualties as
                            they occur but making future periodic announcements of the total killed
                            in Laos since the initiation of reconnaissance flights. This course
                            would not take care of the 11 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss>'s
                            which occurred prior to the beginning of those flights nor would it
                            accommodate other types of casualties, such as missing in action.
                            Consequently, our credibility would still be suspect <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0512"/>and understandably so. Further, we
                            would be subject to being caught at any time because of unclassified
                            Defense Department reports of Laotian casualties, which receive wide
                            circulation. I refer particularly to the report issued weekly by the
                            Directorate for Statistical Services (sample at Tab B).<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3">Attached but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>This course probably would be acceptable to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and the Laotian Government but
                            does not solve the credibility problem.</p>
                        <p>2. Fold in all casualties (not just deaths) on a predetermined date with
                            our Vietnam casualty reports and then keep up to date as casualties
                            occur. This would have to include our daily release of the names of
                            casualties (which do not include mention of the country concerned),
                            since both <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UPI1">UPI</gloss> keep book on us and make sure that the total number of
                            names released equals the total numbers announced. This latter
                            requirement provides the basic weakness of this alternative since the
                            wire services, by specifically requesting where each individual listed
                            was killed or was located when reported <gloss target="#t_MIA1">MIA</gloss> or wounded, could extract the total casualties incurred
                            in Laos—even though this information was not available from the
                            published totals. Such action would permit them to publish separately
                            and regularly a Laotian casualty list. This would be obviously contrary
                            to our national policy. We could possibly decline to answer such
                            specific requests on the basis of national security but the information
                            could be obtained from the next of kin if the wire services or some
                            other media or political group wished to take the trouble to check.
                            Needless to say, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> might complain. Should we adopt this
                            alternative today, we would have to include 28 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> (including the 11 killed prior to the beginning of the
                            requested reconnaissance flights, the names of the 11 disclosed in May
                            and six new dead since then), 26 <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss>, 34
                                <gloss target="#t_MIA1">MIA</gloss>, and two captured. This influx
                            of names almost certainly would cause a short press flap. However, we
                            could live with this except for the potential problem already mentioned
                            of weekly, press generated Laotian casualty reports.<note n="4" xml:id="d243fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> approved
                                Alternative 2 on July 20.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Begin issuing regular Laotian casualty reports. This has the major
                            disadvantage of being completely contrary to current national policy,
                            distasteful to the Laotians and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, and might give an indication of the level of
                            our effort in Laos. On the plus side, however, it is the best solution
                            from the standpoint of credibility. We could truthfully rebut any
                            accusation of hiding our casualties in connection with the war in
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Do nothing. This alternative would be most acceptable to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, but put us in a
                            hopeless situation should the matter of the credibility of our casualty
                            statistics ever be <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0513"/>seriously
                            pushed. We would also be on the spot should we ever begin to use B–52's
                            regularly in Laos or mount clandestine ground operations in that country
                            which result in casualties.</p>
                        <p>Basically, the problem revolves around two points: (1) Is it more
                            important to the Administration to cater to <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and continue to try to hide our Laotian
                            casualties, or (2) is it more important to strike a blow to close the
                            alleged “credibility gap” and assure the American public that we are
                            telling the truth about all our combat casualties in Southeast Asia. I
                            believe that the latter point is overriding. Our credibility is under
                            attack and the severe blow which could be inflicted by the revelation
                            that we are hiding casualties could be a telling one in the November
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>I recommend therefore that we adopt alternative 2, concurrently
                            explaining the national security ramifications involved to the
                            responsible newsmen concerned in the hope that they do not push on the
                            matter of trying to issue regular Laotian casualty reports.</p>

                            Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Houa Phan, and Phong Saly) has increased <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0514"/>spectacularly over past year
                            from total of 39 battalions as of 1 July 1965 to 63 battalions as of 1
                            July 1966.</p>
                        <p>A. On 1 July 1965 we estimate there were (1) one bn NVN; (2) 15 bns
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> with NVN advisers; and (3) 23 bns
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN (bns with attached NVN units
                            of company size).</p>
                        <p>B. On 1 July 1966 we estimate there were (1) 13 bns NVN infantry; (2) 10
                            bns NVN engineer troops; (3) 15 bns <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            with NVN advisers; and (4) 25 bns <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN.</p>
                        <p>3. This large build-up of NVN troops began last fall and culminated in
                            largest <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> offensive yet seen in
                            northern Laos. Offensive began in November 1965 and succeeded in taking
                            number of long existing sites from friendly forces in Houa Phan (Sam
                            Neua) Province as well as sites recently regained by <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>. Friendly forces did not panic,
                            fought series of bitter actions against NVN units, and moved to new
                            bases north and west of enemy forces in order to be so placed as to put
                            continuing pressure on enemy flanks. Enemy intention was apparently to
                            establish a secure <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> along Route 6 to
                            Plain of Jars with ultimate objective of being in position to resume
                            offensive at start of next dry season (October 1966).</p>
                        <p>4. In April 1966 an integrated close air support system was introduced.
                            Additional forward air controllers were stationed in area; A 1–E's were
                            used as airborne forward control; approximately 32 jet sorties were
                            scheduled daily; and close collaboration was established [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] to
                            provide detailed and timely intelligence on enemy movements and on enemy
                            logistics on Routes 6 and 7.</p>
                        <p>5. Marriage of excellent intelligence furnished by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and superb performance by 7th AE units
                            enabled outnumbered friendly units not only to contain enemy offensive
                            but to mount a counter offensive which has now regained 90 per cent of
                            area lost from November 1965 to April 1966. <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> T–28's also made considerable contribution to this
                            effort. Enemy troop strength is still greater than friendly troop
                            strength but high casualties inflicted on enemy units plus severe
                            shortage of supplies brought about by airstrikes on enemy logistical
                            system lowered morale of both NVN and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            units. Loss of morale and lack of supplies have enabled friendly
                            elements to gain and hold the initiative.</p>
                        <p>6. Enemy casualties in northern Laos from November 1965 until June 1966
                            in total of 952 ground clashes have been 1,359 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> and 783 <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss>; friendly
                            losses this period have been 517 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> and
                            678 <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss>. During May/June alone, in 348
                            clashes enemy lost 556 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> and 134
                                <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss>. Although these figures reflect
                            combined NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> casualties, they were
                            predominantly North Vietnamese regular troops and were result of a
                            grinding guerrilla campaign of ambushes, small unit actions, etc. In
                            addition, from November 1965 until June 1966 enemy lost by conservative
                            estimate (predominantly from ground observers) some 4,300 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> and 700 <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss> from <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> air strikes.</p>
                        <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0515"/>
                        <p>7. Apart from their in-country significance, operations in northern Laos
                            have thus made an important contribution to Allied military effort in
                            Vietnam by engaging a substantial portion of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> forces cited in paragraph 2B above in costly operations
                            outside main theater of operation in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. Single most important factor rendering these operations
                            costly to enemy has been <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> tactical
                            support. Recommend <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> extend

                        <p>8. As noted in the cable sent to you (copy attached),<note n="2" xml:id="d246fn2">The attached telegram from <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> at Udorn, July 28, described
                                the North Vietnamese buildup and offensive in north Laos against Meo
                                (Hmong) units that began in November 1965. Meo units fought a series
                                of bitter actions as they retreated. In April 1966 the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> began jet sorties against the
                                North Vietnamese in close collaboration with <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> and the Meo. <persName corresp="#p_CWE1">Colby</persName> noted that “the marriage of
                                excellent intelligence furnished by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and the superb performance by the 7th AF has
                                enabled outnumbered friendly units to not only contain the enemy
                                offensive, but to mount a counteroffensive which has regained 90% of
                                the area lost.”</note> I found the situation in Laos exhilarating.
                            This is not only true of Northern Laos, which my cable discussed, but
                            also of the situation in the South. The bases at Pakse and Savannakhet
                            are vigorously targeted at the principal objective in the area, the Ho
                            Chi Minh Trail, and are pressing operations there with courage, energy
                            and a high degree of professionalism. Most heartening was the contrast
                            between this visit in July and my visit to Laos in October 1965. At that
                            time, Pathet Lao guerrillas were at large in the neighborhood of the
                            city and indeed in January 1966 attacked a radio relay post on the hill
                            overlooking the city, the key Plateau of Bolovens was an inviting <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0517"/>and vulnerable target for
                            Pathet Lao seizure and the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> was torn
                            between trying to defend against at least three PL/VC threats near
                            Saravane, Attopeu and Pak Song. In July 1966, an extensive net of local
                            security forces exists on the Plateau except for a small area of
                            residual Pathet Lao presence being encircled and gradually eliminated.
                            The area near Saravane has been subjected to a most impressive exercise
                            in “oil spotting” so that the road is now open between there and Pakse,
                            protected by village security forces and Special Guerrilla Units. Both
                            Lao and <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> aircraft are finding
                            remunerative targets. In contrast to the situation in Laos in October of
                            1965, these areas are being used as jump off points for road watch and
                            harassment teams moving east of the Sekong River into the Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail area. One limitation on these operations is the availability of
                            adequate armored helicopter support, which we will be trying to
                            increase. Our side in Laos has the initiative and is looking around for
                            additional work to do.</p>
                        <p>9. The most important point of a review of the Lao situation is the clear
                            effect of a smoothly working country team under a forceful Ambassador
                            and the strength that results from patient adherence to a balanced
                            program of building popular participation in local security forces,
                            guerrilla units for reinforcement and regular forces for contesting the
                            main forces of the enemy, with full use of closely coordinated air
                            support. Since this is a direct development of the President's action
                            plan for Laos initiated in July 1963,<note n="3" xml:id="d246fn3">For

                            levels to enable it to carry on these programs, plus a variety of
                            opportunities which present themselves in Vientiane for coverage of

                            channels and the programs not be jeopardized by political difficulties

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Although there is a temporary lull in
                            the political confrontation between <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> and the National Assembly, the factors that caused
                            the crisis still exist. Souvanna's political demands were emotionally
                            inspired and were not to achieve specific political objectives. During
                            the crisis, anti-Souvanna sentiment and the concept of an inevitable
                            change of government increased in scope; however, Assembly leadership
                            failed to provide a formula of alternate leadership and failed to
                            develop a widespread desire to bring down Souvanna's government. The
                            King's view that it was essential to retain Souvanna government was
                            presented to the Assembly by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Oudom
                                Souvannavong</persName>; however <persName corresp="#p_OS1">Oudom</persName> was not in Vientiane when it came to a showdown.
                            The army played a major role in preserving Souvanna as Prime Minister
                            and dispatched officers to persuade deputies to tone down their attacks.
                            Senior generals were prepared to support Souvanna temporarily; but said
                            that time is coming for a change. Lao Armed Forces' schedule calls for a
                            gradual assumption of power through political means. Souvanna's
                            government could fail as a result of: ill conceived vote of censure or
                            no confidence by Assembly; or as a result of an over-reaction by the
                            young-power seeking colonels to a crisis in Vientiane. However, Souvanna
                            will probably not lose his mandate before the Assembly closes in
                            October. The real-power seekers are trying to wear Souvanna down, and,
                            at the same time, are building up their own political machine which will
                            arrange an orderly transition of power.</p>

                        <p>From the Fall of 1965 to date an estimated 70,000 North Vietnamese
                            personnel have been committed to a priority campaign in cooperation with
                            the puppet Pathet Lao forces in Laos to:</p>
                        <p>A. Occupy and control the strategically important North and Northeast
                            area of Laos.</p>
                        <p>B. To develop and maintain a complex road network through the Panhandle
                            of Laos (the “Ho Chi Minh Trail”) in order to funnel personnel and
                            supplies to the Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Because of the magnitude and severity of this predominantly North
                            Vietnamese drive, coupled with the war in Vietnam, it has been of
                            priority importance to use <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-trained
                            and -armed tribal assets as elements of a coordinated Country Team
                            program against these two major North Vietnamese efforts.</p>
                        <p>During late-1965 and early-1966 there was a major enemy buildup in all
                            three Northern project areas (see Tab A).<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> Twelve battalions of North
                            Vietnamese infantry, ten battalions of North Vietnamese engineer troops,
                            fifteen battalions of Pathet Lao with North Vietnamese advisors, and
                            twenty-five battalions of Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese entered in
                            Northern Laos.</p>
                        <p>In the Sam Neua compartment the enemy took a number of long-held friendly
                            positions in a series of bitterly contested engagements. Meo units under
                            General <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> moved to
                            positions north and west of the line of advance, remaining in position
                            to put constant pressure on the enemy's flanks during his drive south.
                            In the Nam Ou corridor, south of Phong Saly in North Laos, the enemy
                            succeeded in clearing the significant Nam Ou River Valley of friendly
                            opposition and then proceeded to <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0520"/>buildup his logistical channels from Dien Bien Phu down the Nam Ou to
                            the north of Luang Prabang both east and west of the river. Along the
                            Nam Tha corridor enemy action reflected a trend similar to that of the
                            Nam Ou area in efforts to expand south attempting to clear the river
                            valley of friendly influences, secure the rice-producing area, and
                            consolidate gains. In April 1966 the United States Air Force with
                            Forward Air Controllers joined the action. A close collaboration was
                            established between the Headquarters of General <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> (Leader of the Meo Paramilitary
                            force), the 7th Air Force, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>/Vientiane [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] to provide detailed and timely
                            intelligence to the strike aircraft operating in direct support of
                            ground action. Concurrently a series of guerrilla actions were initiated
                            by friendly forces. The merger of these two actions enabled friendly
                            units not only to contain the enemy offensive but to mount a
                            counteroffensive which regained 90 per cent of the area lost during the
                            previous enemy offensive. Although out- numbered, our paramilitary
                            forces now have the initiative and are engaging the enemy on an almost
                            daily basis. With direct air support provided by 7th Air Force planes
                            who receive target briefs from the target analysis and control base at
                            Udorn, they are tying down a large <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            force, inflicting significant troop casualties, destroying supplies and
                            effectively interrupting logistical lines.</p>
                        <p>During this same period, we have trained and deployed 29 roadwatch teams
                            along the “Ho Chi Minh Trail” in Southeast Laos to provide tactical
                            information on the movement of men and materiel into South Vietnam. This
                            information is transmitted by radio to the Central Control Base in
                            Udorn, Thailand, and to <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> aircraft to
                            facilitate Air Force interdiction attacks against the Trail. Techniques
                            to facilitate this Country Team interdiction campaign are being improved
                            constantly. Tribal assets are employed to provide security for forward
                            team launch bases.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, a Country Team area security program called the Sedone
                            Valley Project is proving successful in consolidating the western-half
                            of the lower Lao panhandle and providing a secure base for operations
                            into the “Ho Chi Minh Trail”. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            directs the security aspects of this program.</p>
                        <p>In the conduct of this counterinsurgency program, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> provides logistics, salaries, and subsistence to the
                            tribal forces and provides support base and training facilities. One of
                            the largest cost items is the provision of air support for forward
                            supply of field forces and infiltration/exfiltration of teams.</p>

                        <p>Because of the importance of the counterinsurgency program in Laos to the

                            estimates that there were about 10,000 engineers (including coolie
                            labor) and about 3,000 NVNA personnel in support activities such as
                            medical, supply, transportation, signal, command, etc., which gave total
                            18,325 NVNA personnel in Laos as of 1 July 1965.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_OB1">OB</gloss> estimates for 1 July 1966 reflected
                            19 probably NVNA infantry bns with strength of 7,435 troops, 4,525 NVNA
                            troops attached to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> battalions from
                            platoon to company strength and 680 NVNA troops attached to <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> battalions as advisors. Same estimate
                            reflected 21,000 engineers (including coolies) and about 7,000 in
                            support activities which gave total of 42,265 NVNA personnel in Laos as
                            of 1 July 1966.</p>
                        <p>4. Comparison of 1 July 1965 and 1 July 1966 figures indicate increase of
                            23,430 NVNA personnel in Laos during that one year period.</p>
                        <p>5. Eighty percent of the infantry (NVNA) (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVNA) and (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/NVN)
                            increase attributable to influx of new personnel into Laos from North
                            Vietnam. A 100 percent increase in engineer personnel (including
                            coolies) reflected movement new personnel into Laos in conjunction with
                            50 percent increase engineer effort at road building maintenance during
                            the past nine months.</p>
                        <p>6. Support personnel in Laos increased over 100 percent in connection
                            with increased activity in infantry and engineer fields.</p>
                        <p>7. Above figures considered as confirmed within <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>'s <gloss target="#t_OB1">OB</gloss> accept-ance
                            criteria (para 8) and as such reflect reporting from human sources in
                            areas where there is continuing coverage in depth. As indicated paras 5
                            and 6, therefore, major portion above increase reflects actual movement
                            new NVNA personnel and units into Laos including normal replacement

                            blended in making judgements on which troops reflect casualty rotation
                            replacements vis-à-vis troops belonging to new unit. For example, four
                            thousand troops reported Ref B not killed in one fell swoop but over
                            period Nov 65–Jun 66, prior to, throughout and after which period <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> continues receive reports of manpower
                            conscription throughout Laos and of troops arriving in Laos from
                            NVN.</p>
                        <p>9. Ref A, however, also considered areas not covered in depth by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> human sources and reflected use of
                            sources such as aerial photography, special intelligence and refugee
                            interrogations to make estimate of enemy strength in those areas. This
                            estimate primarily an extension of enemy strength identified in well
                            covered areas of Laos and as such <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            considers majority enemy personnel in areas where estimates were made to
                            also reflect new bodies from NVN.</p>
                        <p>10. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> conclusion: at least two-thirds
                            of NVN increase mentioned Ref B attributable actual movement new
                            personnel into Laos. Increase in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            strength (Ref B) on other hand reflects almost exclusively bookkeeping
                            changes based on refinement of estimates made possible by receipt
                            additional and more detailed information.</p>

                            also believes that there is evidence of a diminution in <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> combat and combat support activity which
                            may to some extent offset the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>

                        </list>
                        <p>As you know, we are vitally interested in reducing infiltration into
                            South Vietnam through the Laotian panhandle. Vehicular travel in this
                            area is virtually halted by softening of the road surfaces during the
                            monsoon season. Project Pop Eye is a covert and highly classified
                            operational experiment which we plan to run within the next few weeks in
                            the Laotian panhandle. It will determine the feasibility of increasing
                            the rainfall during the current monsoon season and possibly extending
                            its duration.</p>
                        <p>The objective would be to damage the trail structure by heavy rain. The
                            materials involved are non-toxic and will not harm vegetation. The
                            increased rainfall will be limited to a small controlled area,
                            approximately 200 square miles. Plans have been made and will be put
                            into operation within approximately 20 days—just prior to the end of the
                            normal monsoon season.</p>
                        <p>Concurrence in the merits of the experiment has been received from both
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> and the theater commanders.
                            Technical adequacy of the experiment has been verified by Dr. Hornig who
                            concurs that we should proceed. Approval for the conduct of the test has
                            been received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> under the condition that it be run covertly,
                            and the State Department has also concurred.</p>
                        <p>I have authorized the program to proceed even though there may be some
                            objections raised by the international scientific community—if there is
                            a breach in security. Such possible objections have not, in the past,
                            prevented the carrying out of military operations considered to be in
                            the interests of our national security.</p>
                        <p>The task of inhibiting infiltration into South Vietnam is one of our most
                            serious unsolved problems—this project might offer a partial solution,
                            if the experiment is successful.</p>

                        <p>1. As result my increasing concern with the enemy's capability to
                            build-up in Laotian Panhandle again this dry season as he did during
                            last northeast monsoon period, I directed my staff to develop a plan to
                            block, deny, spoil, and disrupt the infiltration of enemy personnel and
                            supplies through this area into <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. I
                            will send you by separate message an outline of my general concept to be
                            known as “<gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss>”—(seek-locate-annihilate-monitor).</p>
                        <p>2. A major goal of our plan will be to achieve better integration and
                            more concerted use of resources available to the several agencies
                            operating in subject area. For example, we sometimes find that an air
                            operation must be restricted because road watchers have been established
                            (without prior coordination) in proximity of a priority interdiction
                            point selected by Tiger Hound task force. There is real need for close
                            advance coordination of Cricket expansion with Tiger Hound. To be
                            effective, Tiger Hound needs more free strike zones rather than more
                            restricted areas.</p>
                        <p>3. At my request, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and I met in Udorn on 14 Sep to start the ball
                            rolling. Gen <persName corresp="#p_MGW1">Momyer</persName> accompanied
                            me; Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> brought
                            his Army and Air Attaches and a representative of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/Vientiane. We started with background
                            briefings on intelligence situation (J2/<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>) and on Tally Ho/route package one (Gen <persName corresp="#p_MGW1">Momyer</persName>), emphasizing interrelation
                            these two areas with Tiger Hound and Steel Tiger north. A briefing on
                            the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> concept and an update on <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/Vientiane operations followed.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/V outlined current Cricket assets
                            including present and projected locations. Program underway to expand
                            assets in southern portion of Panhandle. Coordination is working well in
                            Barrell Roll area; major goal is to get similar combined efforts
                            underway in Tiger Hound. A major problem has been getting compatible
                            communications. It is anticipated that ground teams will be equipped
                            with HT–2 radios by end of month for communication with FACs. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/V is working up an overall package to
                            develop a multi-sensor intelligence collection capability, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        <p>5. Substance of major items discussed:</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> Concept. There was general
                            agreement with the concept. Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> emphasized his endorsement of necessity to
                            assume that enemy will meet or exceed his efforts during last dry
                            season. Amb <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> emphasized his
                            endorsement of basic premise that we should start now to intensify
                            operations in Laos to spoil the enemy build-up. In this connection, Amb
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stressed the
                            importance of striking hard between now and mid-November in route
                            package one. If enemy is to build-up in Laos, he will have to assemble
                            construction personnel and equipment in this area during that period;
                            the enemy should present a more lucrative target there than after
                            entering Laos and dispersing. This is part of the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> concept outlined to them. We
                            currently are giving priority to Tally Ho and route package one with
                            emphasis on flexibility to shift weight of effort whenever necessary
                            among Tiger Hound, Steel Tiger North, Tally Ho, and route package
                            one.</p>
                        <p>B. Arc Light. I outlined the importance of Arc Light to the <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> concept and discussed desirability of
                            expeditious concurrence and support for Arc Light strikes from AmEmb
                            Vientiane. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            indicated general agreement with strikes in the border areas between
                            Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and between Laos and NVN.
                            He stated he was willing to request <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>'s concurrence regarding specific areas about which
                            there is hard intelligence; however, State in Washington must approve
                            this and, so far, had opposed his doing so. Considerable discussion
                            developed concerning Arc Light strikes in <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and NVN; the thrust of the comments from Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> was that, while they recognized
                            the sensitiveness of this issue, they considered it less sensitive than
                            what we are doing in Laos. I informed them of my position in favor of
                            Arc Light strikes in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and
                            suggested the Ambassadors get their points across to Washington. The
                            question of B42 bases closer to target areas to improve reaction time
                            also was raised. I pointed out the advantages of bases in the
                            Philippines and Thailand in terms of improved reaction time; Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> made a rather strong
                            favorable pitch for Sittahip, Thailand, as a B52 base.</p>
                        <p>C. Coordination of Operations. I stressed the seriousness of the threat
                            which an enemy build-up in Tiger Hound area poses to my west flank and
                            the importance of having maximum practicable freedom to conduct
                            effective military operations. A particular issue emerging from ensuing
                            discussion was the positioning of ground elements by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> without prior coordination with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, thereby imposing restrictions on US
                            air operations, e.g., road-watch positions located at selected
                            interdiction points (SIPs). Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> agreed that mutual coordination was necessary.
                            It was decided to hold a staff-level conference in Saigon during the
                            week of 19 Sep to work out this and similar problems (Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> will initiate a cable to
                            recommend specific dates).</p>
                        <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0527"/>
                        <p>D. Exchange of Intelligence. We raised problems of getting information
                            obtained by road watchers into <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            intelligence system quickly and completely. It was recognized that
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/Vientiane passes intelligence to
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> through <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>/Saigon in accordance with basic <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> policies, but this is a slow procedure.
                            We proposed a full-time liaison officer from J2/<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> be accepted under such cover as Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> desires in order to expedite
                            the direct exchange of intelligence between AmEmb Vientiane and
                                J2/<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. There was some discussion
                            of an alternate plan to station a J2/<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> liaison officer at Udorn; nothing specific was
                            decided. This matter will be discussed further at Saigon coordination
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>E. Shining Brass. Chief <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> briefly discussed plans for
                            increasing size and capabilities of Shining Brass assets. Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> again raised the comparative
                            sensitiveness of Laos and the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>; he
                            seemed to favor putting Shining Brass assets in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. I pointed out the importance of
                            getting prompt concurrence from AmEmb Vientiane on Shining Brass
                            missions and discussed extension of the Shining Brass special operating
                            area opposite Quang Tri Province from 5 <gloss target="#t_KM1">KM</gloss> to 20 <gloss target="#t_KM1">KM</gloss>. This is
                            required on an urgent basis because of the current threat to Quang Tri
                            Province and the enemy capability to slip around the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> and strike into the province from the
                            west. I consider it enemy attempt to mount a “Dien Bien Phu” type
                            operation against, for example, Khe Sanh. Province is part of my overall
                            plan aggressively to seek information and to nip in the bud any enemy
                            attempts to strike from that area into Quang Tri Province. Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> both expressed similar concern
                            and supported my analysis, particularly in view of the enemy's need to
                            achieve some dramatic success in period just before US elections.
                            Nevertheless, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            stated that, because of his earlier approval of Shining Brass mission
                            with which Washington did not agree, he now had to forward all Shining
                            Brass requests to State Department for their consideration.</p>
                        <p>F. Free Strike Zones. There was general discussion on reducing
                            restrictions on air operations in Tiger Hound. No decisions were
                            reached. This matter will be reopened at proposed Saigon conference
                            during week of 19 Sep.</p>
                        <p>6. It is imperative that we take action now to reduced further enemy
                            build-up in the Panhandle rather than wait until build-up has
                            occurred.</p>
                        <p>7. I consider this Udorn meeting to be a good start on better integration
                            of operations in the Laotian Panhandle. Anticipate more concrete
                            progress at Saigon conference week of 19 Sep. Will keep you
                            informed.</p>

                        <p>1. Reference reported on conference between Amb <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, Amb <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and myself. This message
                            outlines <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> “<gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss>” concept referred to in reference.</p>
                        <p>2. With arrival of northeast monsoon season, weather in Laotian Panhandle
                            will be clearing and enemy is expected to infiltrate personnel and
                            supporting material in quantity through that area. The requirement to
                            counter this threat is evident. If allowed to go unchecked, it will
                            permit enemy to engage our flank in Quang Tri Province from the west and
                            will permit large scale diversionary attacks further south.</p>
                        <p>3. The seriousness of this thrust led us to development of a new concept
                            to block, deny, spoil, and disrupt the infiltration of enemy personnel
                            and supplies through Laos during the forthcoming dry season. During the
                            previous dry season we were experimenting, developing tactics and
                            techniques, and building up our assets. Capitalizing on our experience
                            and improvement of resources, we now have developed a concept of
                            operations for the forthcoming period of good weather which I believe
                            will improve significantly our ability to counter the infiltration
                            threat through the Laotian Panhandle. The concept hinges on two basic
                            principles:</p>
                        <p>A. First, we will intensify around-the-clock surveillance and
                            interdiction of known infiltration routes. This process will stress
                            attack of selected interdiction points (<gloss target="#t_SIP1">SIP</gloss>s) as well as strikes against targets of
                            opportunity.</p>
                        <p>B. Second, we will concentrate our resources on successive key target
                            areas to be known as “SLAMs.”</p>
                        <p>4. Highlights of our concept, which consists in turn of a series of
                            overlapping phases, are as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Phase One. All intelligence collection agencies (all-sensor air
                            reconnaissance, road watcher, <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>'s,
                            Shining Brass, etc.) will intensify <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0529"/>their efforts. Our goal in this phase is to refine our
                            knowledge of enemy capabilities to infiltrate through Laos and to obtain
                            indications as to what and where he will put his major efforts. During
                            this collection phase, we will continue normal Tiger Hound strikes and
                            other actions at approximately current rates. In essence, during the
                            pre-northeast monsoon season, we will continue pressure with Tally Ho
                            interdiction in route package one, keeping a sharp eye on Steel
                            Tiger.</p>
                        <p>B. Phase Two. As our intelligence base expands, we will effect transition
                            from phase one into phase two. Current reconnaissance and offensive
                            operations throughout the Panhandle will be continued, with priority to
                            enemy buildup capabilities, i.e., engineer and other construction
                            efforts, way stations, supply points, and staging areas. Concentrated
                            intelligence on these potential target areas will provide required data
                            for selection of key target areas.</p>
                        <p>C. Phase Three. Once an area is designated as a “<gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss>,” we will hit the target with sufficient B–52 and
                            tactical airstrikes to neutralize it. This action will be followed by
                            visual and photo air reconnaissance and/or ground reconnaissance patrols
                            and, if appropriate, exploitation forces. During the stage involving
                            ground forces, the only application of air power will be in direct
                            support of Shining Brass. Latter elements, on withdrawal, will leave
                            mines and booby traps; Air Force will follow with air-delivered land
                            mines. In special instances, we plan to leave “stay behind”
                            reconnaissance parties. Dependent upon the area and intelligence, the
                            sequence of applying these resources will be altered. This process will
                            be repeated against each developed target. It is essential in this
                            regard, to understand that massing our efforts on a specific “<gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss>” area does not mean ignoring other
                            targets. <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>'s and armed reconnaissance
                            aircraft will be scouring the roads; road watchers and Shining Brass
                            will operate in their territories; and our other intelligence operations
                            will continue.</p>
                        <p>D. During all phases, there will be an intensification of psychological
                            warfare and herbicide operations.</p>
                        <p>5. In summary, the enemy capability to infiltrate personnel and
                            supporting material through the Laotian Panhandle is a definite threat
                            to our efforts in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. We must use all
                            assets at our disposal to block, deny, spoil and disrupt this
                            infiltration.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary. Since the defeat of the budget on 16 September 1966 and the
                            subsiding of the flood waters in the city without serious epidemic or
                            starvation, there has been the most intensive period of political
                            maneuvering in Vientiane since the July 1965 elections. The main
                            contestants, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> and a majority grouping of the Assembly, have
                            competed to influence the King, the King's Council and the army without,
                            however, resorting to violence or even a serious threat of violence. The
                            extremity of the positions initially adopted by each contestant eased
                            somewhat and a compromise solution which would preserve elements of the
                            positions of both sides can yet emerge from the continuing discussions.
                            The intense political activity that took place in the period from 16 to
                            26 September was characterized by the following main thrusts:</p>
                        <p>A. The Assembly acted with a greater degree of cohesion than heretofore,
                            first in its disparate elements combining to vote against the budget and
                            later when the repercussions of this action and Souvanna's counteraction
                            became apparent, to work under some degree of leadership for its
                            survival.</p>
                        <p>B. Souvanna plunged into the political fight using his influence with the
                            King, with the King's Council and to a lesser extent with the army to
                            bring pressure on the Assembly to back down.</p>
                        <p>C. The King has not shunned his constitutional responsibility for playing
                            a decisive role in resolving controversies of this sort, but he has thus
                            far sought to let the parties play their game out with a minimum of
                            interference.</p>
                        <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0531"/>
                        <p>D. Lastly, the army as an organizational entity did not intervene to
                            influence the Assembly directly in favor of the government and Souvanna
                            did not seek this. Its overall political role was more passive than in
                            previous crises and it worked to control its own rebellious elements,
                            the perennial angry colonels of the Fifth Military Zone.</p>

                        <p>I have your memorandum of September 30 to Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName>
                            <note n="2" xml:id="d254fn2">Not found.</note> and, by means of a review
                            of how Shining Brass has come to be what and where it is, would like to
                            explain our reasons for asking that you seek to clear the proposed
                            Public Affairs Guidance with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Shining Brass operations involving small reconnaissance teams were first
                            authorized in September 1965. They began in October 1965 on an
                            infrequent, experimental basis, with shallow penetrations along the
                            border in the southern portion of the panhandle. The mission was
                            detection, not harassment, of the movement of men and supplies from
                            North Vietnam into South Vietnam via Laos.</p>
                        <p>Although the pattern of individual missions has varied, the military
                            authorities judge the over-all operation an unqualified success and an
                            essential adjunct to effective pursuit of our military objectives in
                            Vietnam. The most dramatic result has been an ability to pinpoint
                            targets for tactical air strikes, and in many instances the ground teams
                            have verified good results. Less spectacular but of importance to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> have been the myriad of particular
                            intelligence items that, in combination with information from other
                            sources, have helped build a picture of the infiltration process.</p>
                        <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0532"/>
                        <p>From the beginning the Department's approval of Shining Brass operations
                            has been predicted on their being conducted in a deniable fashion. This
                            was done initially by severely limiting the depth and method of
                            penetration and by briefings of the teams and other devices to make
                            credible the story that such operations were taking place within
                            Vietnam. This posture has been necessary because Shining Brass has never
                            been discussed with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> (though some of his military staff officers are
                            aware of it) and because of his flat opposition to U.S. military ground
                            action in Laos. In one statement of his position, on October 24, 1965,
                            he said publicly that he opposes entry of U.S. ground troops into Laos:
                            “So long as I am Chief of Government I will not involve my country in
                            this adventure.”</p>
                        <p>Over the intervening months, at the urgent request of General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> fully supported by the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, the nature of Shining Brass
                            operations has gradually altered. The authorized depth of penetration
                            has been increased and the use of helicopters for infiltration purposes
                            has been extended from a depth of 5 to 12 kms. The approved operating
                            area has been temporarily extended northward to the area in Laos
                            adjoining the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. Further temporary
                            extensions have been granted because of military requirements for flank
                            protection (strategic warning of enemy movements derived from the Recce
                            Team reports) for major U.S. military operations in Quang Tri and
                            adjacent areas in Vietnam. We have authorized limited use of
                            platoon-size “exploitation forces” against targets which the Recce Teams
                            have found attractive for destruction of cached supplies and similar
                            harassment. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            reviews all proposed missions in advance and we retain a “veto” power in
                            the Department.</p>
                        <p>The message<note n="3" xml:id="d254fn3">Not found.</note> which
                            occasioned your memorandum was prepared concurrently with our approval
                            of another temporary extension in the authorized Shining Brass operating
                            area—into a heavily infested area north of Route 9 and to a depth
                            approaching 20 kilometers from the Vietnam border. This, again, is
                            directly connected with a major current operation in Vietnam and is
                            designed to ensure timely intelligence of any enemy movement aimed
                            toward entrapment of U.S. units along the western Laotian border in
                            South Vietnam. In this new area, the ever present risk of contacts and
                            disclosure will increase. Furthermore, we anticipate military requests
                            for further expansion of operations during the coming dry season. Hence
                            the need for explicit public affairs guidance; earlier the guidance was
                            most general and rested on the relatively easy deniability of the
                            operations because of their proximity to the frontier.</p>
                        <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0533"/>
                        <p>In the light of Souvanna's position and our relationship with him we
                            simply have not been able to devise an alternative to denial. I realize,
                            of course, the possibility of evidence being adduced that would require
                            comment beyond the initial denial. What our proposal means, therefore,
                            is that any disclosure following a denial would have to be dealt with by
                            devising an explanation of a mistake. We would hold firmly to the
                            proposition that the U.S. “is not conducting such operations” (i.e.,
                            deliberately, as a matter of policy) and if under pressure from
                            Communist charges explain any transgression as inadvertent (e.g. bad
                            weather, bad maps, retreat in wrong direction). Paragraph 2 of the
                            proposed message is designed to elicit promptly enough information for
                            us to prepare an explanation tailored to the specific circumstances.</p>
                        <p>We are sympathetic to and respectful of the credibility problem we may
                            face. There are the major domestic factors of the Manila Meeting and the
                            elections. We are also concerned about the possibility that the
                            Communists might spring some specific story connected with these
                            operations timed to undercut Souvanna's expected denunciation of North
                            Vietnamese aggression against Laos before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly in mid-October.</p>
                        <p>I am satisfied that the military requirements of the situation in
                            northern South Vietnam are such that we cannot withdraw operating
                            authority that has been given only after searching inter-departmental
                            examination. I therefore recommend that, as I understand is your
                            intention, you discuss the problem with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Moyers</persName>, for he should be thoroughly aware of this issue,
                            and seek his approval of the proposed guidance.</p>

                        <p>1. This is first of two rather presumptuous messages suggesting the sort
                            of scenario which I believe will make Souvanna's conversations in New
                            York and Washington most profitable to all concerned. This telegram will
                            concern the meeting with the President. The second will cover
                            conversations with other U.S. officials.<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">Telegram 2105 from Vientiane, October 8, in which the Embassy
                                suggested that U.S. officials commend Souvanna for the Lao Armed
                                Forces accomplishments against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese;
                                remark on his Finance Minister's efficient direction of the
                                Ministry; and listen carefully for signs of Souvanna's increasing
                                disenchantment with tripartitism. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Meeting with President. Souvanna clearly regards this meeting as the
                            prime objective of his visit. Therefore, he will doubtless have a
                            carefully prepared presentation in mind. I would consequently suggest
                            that the best way to start off this meeting would be for the President
                            to ask Souvanna's general views on Southeast Asia, how to achieve peace
                            in Vietnam, or some equally broad subject.</p>
                        <p>3. This discussion will doubtless lead into the meat of Souvanna's
                            concerns. There are basically three matters on which he would welcome
                            reassurance from the President personally:</p>
                        <p>A) That we continue to hope to work positively with the Soviet Union
                            towards the ultimate development of stability in Southeast Asia
                            (Souvanna has long seen the only hope for Southeast Asia as a tacit
                            entente between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            bulwark against ChiCom ambitions—at least until such time as ChiComs
                            tame down at home and Southeast Asian infrastructure is in better
                            shape).</p>
                        <p>B) That we have no intention mount invasion of Laos or across Laos from
                            U.S. military positions in Thailand or Vietnam. Communist propaganda
                            (especially Soviet) constantly accuses us of having this intention as
                            sole means effectively cutting Ho Chi Minh Trail. I don't know how
                            explicit President might wish to be on this point. It could conceivably
                            be covered by a more generalized statement about “no desire to expand
                            war beyond its current boundaries, etc.”</p>
                        <p>C) That we will do our best to persuade other nations, such as Japan,
                            Germany, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Australia, to continue
                            and to augment their economic <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0535"/>and technical aid to Laos. Souvanna is extremely grateful for U.S.
                            aid, but his status as a “neutral” and his ability to hold his tenuous
                            balance with the Soviets will depend upon avoiding the appearance of
                            being a total dependent of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>4. Aside from these points and whatever Souvanna may wish raise in his
                            presentation, President may also wish:</p>
                        <p>A) Express our admiration for political risks Souvanna has been willing
                            take in collaborating with our military efforts;</p>
                        <p>B) Express sympathy for suffering and damage caused to Laos by recent
                            Mekong floods;</p>
                        <p>C) Give Souvanna brief summary of U.S. expectations in seven-nation
                            Manila conference.</p>
                        <p>5. There is always possibility Souvanna may unpredictably raise some
                            particular request for aid—as he did with helicopters when he saw Vice
                            President last year. These requests are usually result of promises he
                            had made to general staff or some minister here in Vientiane. I fear I
                            cannot forecast what form this sort of thing might take.</p>
                        <p>6. President should be aware that Souvanna is not an expert in fiscal
                            affairs, economic development or regional planning. He has good
                            individual ideas and his enthusiasm can be aroused for specific
                            projects. However, he has no coordinated plan and is not much of a
                            genius in this field.</p>
                        <p>7. I don't know whether Souvanna will specifically raise with President
                            the Soviet proposal to overfly Laos in order avoid China.<note n="4" xml:id="d255fn4">In telegram 1854 from Vientiane, September 28,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> reported that
                                Souvanna had received a request from the Soviet Union to reroute its
                                “airline” to Hanoi over Laos to avoid overflying China. Souvanna
                                told <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that he assumed
                                the Soviet Charge was talking about Aeroflot, and not a military
                                airlift. (Ibid., POL LAOS–<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>)</note> I think this may depend on how far advanced
                            the Soviet-Chinese rupture is at the time, and whether proposal has been
                            formally made. Since Souvanna will probably not have seen <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> before he sees President, I
                            would rather expect him to defer this point until his talks with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and State

                        <p>You have agreed to see Laos Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday in New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>He comes at a time of political conflict and uncertainty in Laos. The
                            National Assembly has been dissolved after rejecting his government's
                            new budget, tantamount to a vote of “no confidence.” New elections
                            probably will be held early next year, but the viability of the
                            tripartite coalition government established by the 1962 Geneva
                            Agreements has been shaken. Souvanna, nevertheless, continues to
                            personify “tripartitism,” and your meeting with him will serve to
                            buttress his leadership.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna is openly dedicated to Lao neutrality but in private strongly
                            supports our actions to end North Vietnamese aggression.</p>
                        <p>King <persName corresp="#p_SV1">Savang Vatthana</persName> has told
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that our
                            policy in Laos is “exactly right” in all respects and hoped we found
                            Laotian policy “useful” to our larger purposes in Asia.</p>
                        <p>At the outset you may want to:</p>
                        <p>(1) Regret that your illness a year ago prevented your seeing Souvanna
                            then. A meeting had been tentatively arranged.</p>
                        <p>(2) Note the unfortunate loss of life and crop damage from the recent
                            flooding of the Mekong—the worst in 40 years—and promise our continuing
                            assistance to help the Lao recover.</p>
                        <p>I recommended that you then give Souvanna an opportunity to present his
                            general views on how to achieve peace in Vietnam and prospects in
                            Southeast Asia. Specifically, he will want reassurance from you
                            personally that</p>
                        <p>—We still hope to work positively with the Soviets toward stability in
                            Southeast Asia. He has long viewed a tacit U.S.-Soviet détente as the
                            best bulwark against Chinese ambitions.</p>
                        <p>—We have no desire to expand the Vietnam conflict beyond present
                            boundaries. He is highly sensitive to Communist propaganda on this point
                            as it affects Laos.</p>
                        <p>—We will continue to encourage other nations to augment their technical
                            and economic aid to Laos. He is grateful for our aid but sees his <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0537"/>country's neutral status and
                            tenuous balance with the Soviets endangered by any appearance of being
                            dependent on the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Aside from reassuring him on these matters you might also:</p>
                        <p>(1) Reaffirm our desire for Laos to live in peace and tranquility with
                            its neighbors, our continuing economic and military assistance to build
                            the economy and enable Laos to resist Communist pressures, and our
                            commitment to the 1962 Geneva Agreements.</p>
                        <p>(2) Express understanding of Souvanna's difficulties in implementing
                            those Agreements and our support for his continuing efforts as Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>(3) Let him know how much we appreciate the political risks he takes in
                            collaborating with our operations against infiltration routes into South
                            Vietnam. (As cooperative as he has been, it should be noted that he has
                            no official knowledge of Shining Brass operations and only limited
                            knowledge of the Arc Light program.)</p>
                        <p>(4) Summarize briefly your expectations from the seven-nation conference
                            in Manila and your Asian trip.</p>
                        <p>There are three specific matters that Souvanna may introduce:</p>
                        <p>Soviet overflight request. The Soviets have requested permission to make
                            Soviet “air line” overflights of Laos en route to Hanoi. Souvanna has
                            deferred a response pending discussion with us. You might note the
                            complexity of this and steer him to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Foreign exchange stabilization. We support a Foreign Exchange Operations
                            Fund along with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, Australia
                            and Japan. There is a shortfall in <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss>
                            1966 funds available. If Souvanna expresses concern he might be
                            reassured of our efforts with the other donors and again be referred to

                        <p>Future of “tripartitism.” Souvanna and other Lao leaders are increasingly
                            doubtful of the further utility of the coalition governmental
                            arrangements specified in the 1962 Geneva Agreements. They tend to
                            believe that an avowed neutralist prime minister, replacing the
                            tripartite facade, would still satisfy the Soviets. This is a tricky
                            area, and it might be advisable to hear Souvanna out without substantive
                            comment.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna has keen insight and knowledge about most Southeast Asian
                            leaders and their policies, including the North Vietnamese. He is
                            particularly interested in the shifting relationships among Moscow,
                            Peking and Hanoi. As committed as he is to maintaining the neutral image
                            of Laos he recognizes that aggression from Hanoi is the source of
                            troubles in Indochina. Advance information is that he will identify
                            Hanoi as the aggressor in his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> address
                            on October 18, and by implication condemn “wars of liberation” as well.
                            Laos had an observer at the ASPAC meeting in Seoul, has joined the Asian
                            Development Bank and is cooperating in regional programs as politically
                            feasible.</p>

                        <p>The Governor said that since Hanoi had not respected the 1962 Geneva
                            Agreements for even one day, how could we be sure that the North
                            Vietnamese would respect them in the future.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister believed that it was necessary to work on the Soviets,
                            to get them to help bring peace to Laos. If peace could be achieved
                            there, it would open the way to a general détente in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>The Governor commented that the tragedy was that the reconciliation we
                            had worked for in Laos had not come about. Moreover, it looked as though
                            the Pathet Lao was moving closer and closer to the Chinese and farther
                            away from the Soviets. The Prime Minister agreed, adding that Chinese
                            influence over the Pathet Lao had grown considerably in recent months.
                            The North Vietnamese, owing to the difficulties they were now
                            experiencing, could not help the Pathet Lao as they had in the past.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0539"/>
                        <p>The Governor asked what Hanoi's current attitude was toward Moscow and
                            Peking. The Prime Minister said that Hanoi is still very close to
                            Moscow. The Governor commented that Moscow seemed to want an end to the
                            struggle but not only did not have enough influence to bring it about
                            but also feared that Peking would accuse the Soviets of being agents of
                            U.S. imperialism.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said he had been in Moscow in April and had talked
                            with Mazuov. He learned that nothing could be done about Laos. The
                            Soviets recognized the existence of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, ergo the
                            presence of North Vietnamese in Laos, but would not act to settle the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The Governor said he hoped that the Prime Minister would do everything
                            possible to maintain good relations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, because if the Soviets considered Laos to be
                            friendly, they would be more comfortable in any steps they took
                            vis-à-vis Hanoi. The Prime Minister said he did not think the Soviets
                            had changed their attitude toward Laos; they continued to trust
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Lao Elections</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> asked the Lao Ambassador
                            whether any decisions had been made concerning the forthcoming elections
                            for the new Assembly. The Ambassador replied in a tone reflecting some
                            surprise since the Prime Minister had informed Finance Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> and him only that
                            morning that the elections would be held on January 1. He said the
                            elections would be regular, as distinct from the special elections held
                            in 1965; they would accord strictly with the Constitution, a condition
                            by which the Prime Minister set great store; and they would be on the
                            basis of universal suffrage without discrimination of any kind. In
                            response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>'s inquiry,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Khamking</persName> replied that
                            they would be under the electoral law of 1957, as amended in 1959 or
                            thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> asked the Prime Minister
                            what he expected the election outcome to be. Souvanna replied with
                            unwonted heat, “the non-election of the members of the present
                            Assembly!” (“He is a hard man at times,” the Lao Ambassador commented in
                            an aside.) Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> asked whether
                            the elections would bring young, new men to office—men young in thought
                            and spirit, concerned for their country's welfare and not their own
                            pockets. The Prime Minister said he did not foresee much of a change
                            since the Lao people were tradition-minded and clung to old, well-known
                            figures. The younger men were “illustres inconnus” to the general
                            populace and did not stand much chance at the polls.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister went on to say that he did not plan to resign as Prime
                            Minister after the elections, because that would mean the end of the
                            Government established at the time of the 1962 Geneva Agreements, a
                            development which would have an unfavorable effect internationally. <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0540"/>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stressed the importance from the international
                            standpoint of maintaining the form of the Geneva settlement of 1962.
                            Souvanna agreed vigorously, in a manner implying there was no need to
                            convert the converted. It was precisely because of this consideration
                            that, while he would probably put two or three new people in the
                            Cabinet, he would keep open the Pathet Lao portfolios. “We do not care,”
                            he said with unusual force, “whether the Pathet Lao participates or not.
                            Others could be named acting to do the work, but the Pathet Lao places
                            would be there.” The main thing was that the form would be
                            preserved.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> expressed the
                            hope that those who were creating political troubles would come to
                            realize the importance of Laos' role in Southeast Asia and in the world
                            at large. The Prime Minister thought that they were becoming more and
                            more aware of that. He said he often stated that if Laos had not
                            achieved its neutrality and if it had not adhered to the 1962
                            Agreements, it would be a much greater battlefield than it is now.<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">

                            centers of North Vietnam. Evidence of the difficulty shows in a decline
                            in North Vietnamese aid to the Pathet Lao.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately Communist China's influence is increasing, replacing NVN's
                            influence on the Pathet Lao. Souvanna thought the Secretary would know
                            of statements by Pathet Lao leaders (<persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>, Singkapo, Sot)
                            to the effect that Mao's thought must be the guide of revolutionary
                            people. This is surprising and worrisome for no such statements have
                            come from North Vietnamese themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister declared that direct Chinese Communist aid was coming
                            to the Pathet Lao. North Vietnam is not in a position to supply the
                            Pathet Lao with items they need because of their own internal troubles.
                            All aid comes from China. The Lao have spotted a number of aircraft over
                            the Plaine des Jarres, continued the Prime Minister. Since North Vietnam
                            would use trucks and since they have no planes, these planes must be
                            Chinese. Furthermore, recent intelligence shows that North Vietnamese
                            troops in Northern Laos (Muong Sing-Nam Tha) have been relieved by
                            Chinese Communist (Lu) troops. Souvanna said the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> concern at the moment is to extend its zone of
                            operations north of Luang Prabang.</p>
                        <p>At a later point in the conversation, the Secretary observed that perhaps
                            the most important development in the area today is what is going on
                            inside China. Did the Prime Minister feel that a more moderate
                            leadership would emerge? Souvanna commented that only good can come out
                            of the situation as far as the free world is concerned. There is strong
                            opposition to the Red Guard among the people and the military. Even
                            today, most Chinese people have lived under the former regime. They are
                            traditionalists; we might almost say conservatives. The Red Guard had
                            gone so far as to accuse the widow of Sun Yat Sen, which was a major
                            blunder because she is greatly respected even within China.</p>
                        <p>Today Mao alone dominates the scene, Souvanna continued. He's sick,
                            however, and the Prime Minister wondered how long he will last. In <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0542"/>1961, he had needed to sit in
                            an arm chair to ride in the elevator from the 1st to the 2nd floor. If
                            Mao goes, the regime cannot hold. Lin Piao is sick also. Souvanna
                            thought we must do something to help topple the regime, which he did not
                            think would be too hard. “Should we use a stick or a carrot?” asked the
                            Secretary. “Both,” replied the Prince. Souvanna said he had information
                            that many Chinese were trying to leave China. There were perhaps two or
                            three million Red Guard with a hard core of four to five hundred
                            thousand. The rest followed from fear.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked Souvanna to do all he could to enlist the Soviets in
                            support of the 1962 Geneva Agreements. He said it was his impression
                            that the Soviet Union did not want a major conflagration in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. It was important to hold the Soviets
                            to the 1954 and 1962 agreements. The Prime Minister responded that this
                            is what the Lao are trying to do. This is why they strive to maintain
                            the tripartite government. It does not disturb them to keep open the
                            seats of the absent Pathet Lao. Souvanna thought that in the near
                            future, if a complete diplomatic break took place between Moscow and
                            Peking, the Soviet Union could then assume a more constructive, more
                            positive role with respect to the 1954 and 1962 agreements. Until there
                            is such a break, Moscow hesitates. Moscow is still trying to bring China
                            back into the Communist world. After a final break, he concluded, Moscow
                            will have a different attitude.<note n="4" xml:id="d258fn4">

                            Prime Minister's responsibilities and that many problems came with them.
                            He had been looking forward to this meeting very much and hoped that the
                            Prime Minister would give him a good fill-in on the situation in Laos
                            and Southeast Asia. He would greatly value hearing the Prime Minister's
                            views and opinions on any subjects he cared to discuss.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister responded that the situation in Southeast Asia was
                            very complex, made even more so by the show of bad will on the part of
                            the Chinese and the North Vietnamese. It had been apparent for some time
                            that the Chinese influence was now the dominant factor. The North
                            Vietnamese tended to draw closer to the Soviet Union and their attitude
                            was more reasonable than the Chinese. Asked by the President if this was
                            a good development, the Prime Minister said that it was indeed
                            encouraging. North Vietnam had much to fear from a neighbor such as
                            China which had dominated Vietnam for centuries. (Later the Prime
                            Minister elaborated on Soviet influence in North Vietnam stating that
                            the Soviets were attempting to gain more influence in that country, but
                            do not have much at the moment.) With the Soviet Union there was at
                            least a possibility of reaching an understanding. The Soviet Union was
                            closer to the countries of the West than China which was completely
                            isolated.</p>
                        <p>Asked by the President to place himself in the President's role for a
                            moment and say what he would do differently, what he would do that <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0544"/>the President was not doing at
                            this time, the Prime Minister emphasized that there was no other
                            solution outside of what the President was now doing. “Would you stop
                            the bombings?” asked the President. “No,” replied the Prime Minister,
                            “because the time is not propitious. North Vietnam has been living a
                            fiction based upon their victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu.” The
                            Prime Minister said he had talked many times with General <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName> feels very strong, he feels that when it comes to
                            infantry the North Vietnamese troops are the best in the world. “What do
                            you think?” asked the President. The Prime Minister asserted that as
                            fighting men they did have great valor. “Why aren't they fighting then;
                            they have 4 to 5 divisions there?” continued the President. The Prime
                            Minister stressed that they were waiting for the right moment.</p>
                        <p>He said that the North Vietnamese have two aims, one is the socialist
                            conquest of the other countries of Indochina: South Vietnam, Central
                            Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The North Vietnamese flag shows a star with
                            five points denoting the five countries of Indochina. The Prime Minister
                            explained that with their dense and increasing population the North
                            Vietnamese needed more land. As the President knew, under the French
                            South Vietnam fed the North. With more population the North needed to
                            extend itself toward the delta. The North Vietnamese had also taken over
                            a concept which was developed by the French Government in colonial days:
                            Laos, with its still abundant resources, colonized by Vietnam and
                            controlled from Hanoi. This then was the dual thrust of the North
                            Vietnamese: the socialist conquest and the need for more living
                            space.</p>
                        <p>The President reiterated his question to the Prime Minister: What would
                            he do that the President was not doing? The Prime Minister replied that
                            the North Vietnamese needed to be shown how much stronger the United
                            States was than they, then they would come to the conference table. They
                            counted on a victory by force of arms as they did over the French. The
                            second point was to give South Vietnam a democratic and stable regime.
                            It was also necessary to give that government the means to increase its
                            economic level to a point where it would be higher than that of the
                            North. The last elections in South Vietnam, continued the Prime
                            Minister, had shown that the people were against a communist regime. He
                            added that even in North Vietnam, where the regime dominated by force
                            and terror, it would be an error to believe that all North Vietnamese
                            were communists. So if for some time the United States continued to bomb
                            North Vietnam, destroying its economic potential and its military
                            installations, and at the same time continued to conduct military
                            strikes against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops in the South, this
                            would help bring them to the conference table. The Prime Minister said
                            that the President had been absolutely right to assert that his country
                            was not attempting to destroy the regime of the North; this point was
                            very important <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0545"/>for their
                            leaders. Asked what kind of installations he would bomb, such as steel
                            mills, cement plants, dikes, etc., the Prime Minister answered that
                            these were the type of targets he had in mind and he commented further,
                            after being asked by the President if this would not entail many
                            civilian losses, that such plants were usually on the periphery of the
                            towns and that in any case the towns had been evacuated and there would
                            not be many victims. He felt that while in April 1964, at the time of
                            his last visit to Hanoi, the North Vietnamese were very confident of
                            military success, this could no longer be the case because of the
                            strength deployed by the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The President asked if the Prime Minister would be agreeable to saying a
                            few words to the press and together they outlined what the Prime
                            Minister might say. The Prime Minister listed the following points: This
                            was his first call on the President. He had availed himself of this
                            opportunity to inform the President of the situation in Southeast Asia.
                            Together they have reviewed the situation there trying to find the
                            solution to the present problems. The Prime Minister saw the convening
                            of a conference with a membership similar to, or broader than, the
                            Geneva conference of 1954 as the way to a solution.</p>
                        <p>While waiting for the press to appear, the President asked the Prime
                            Minister for information about the recent floods. The Prime Minister
                            emphasized what a great disappointment this tragedy had been for his
                            country. They had lost a bumper crop of rice. Thanks to the aid of
                            friendly countries and in particular of <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> they had overcome the difficulties and forestalled
                            epidemics. Damage was valued at approximately $5 million mostly in crops
                            and buildings destroyed and livestock killed. The President asked if
                            there had been many losses in human lives and the Prime Minister said
                            there had been about one hundred victims. It was the worst disaster in
                            40 years. The President assured the Prime Minister that we wanted to
                            work very closely with his government to meet the problems caused by the
                            flood and that we wanted to do all we could to help.</p>
                        <p>The President assured the Prime Minister of our desire to play a
                            positive, constructive role for stability in Southeast Asia. We did not
                            want to keep troops there, or bases, or dictate the political affairs of
                            any of these countries. We wanted to be a helpful friend, not a
                            dominating presence. At the same time we believed that freedom and
                            self-determination were very important for the people of Southeast Asia
                            just as they were for any American family. We did not want to widen the
                            conflict, stated the President.</p>
                        <p>The President urged the Prime Minister to stimulate as many countries as
                            possible to take an active interest in helping foster the economic
                            development of Laos. We were very much aware of our commitment under the
                            1962 Agreement and we wanted Laos to live in peace and tranquility <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0546"/>and we would continue to help
                            in the economic development of Laos.</p>
                        <p>The President pledged his personal support to the Prime Minister and his
                            difficult task. The President emphasized the importance of a meeting
                            such as the forthcoming Manila conference. He said also that the Asian
                            Development Bank and our concern with regional development in Asia must
                            surely help convince the people of that region that we were not
                            interested in Europe alone. At Manila we shall meet with the chiefs of
                            state of all countries having troops in Vietnam. We were ready to go
                            immediately from the battlefield to the conference table. It should be
                            clear to all by now that it was Ho Chi Minh who refused to do the
                            talking. The Koreans had about 50 thousand troops in South Vietnam now,
                            the Philippines were sending a contingent, Australia/New Zealand had
                            sizeable contingents and we were increasing our own forces. Hanoi must
                            certainly understand that it could not win.</p>
                        <p>Asked about his own plans and projects for the development of Laos, the
                            Prime Minister mentioned the trips he had made to get help from other
                            friendly countries. Then he cited a project involving a bridge over the
                            Mekong. It was hoped that Japan would participate in that venture, and
                            he would be happy if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would take the
                            initiative with regard to the project. The President said he would
                            explore this. The President also assured the Prime Minister of our
                            continued participation in <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>[The press then came in and the Prime Minister and the President each
                            made statements.]<note n="3" xml:id="d259fn3">Brackets in the source

                        </p>
                        <p>Following the statements to the press, the President told the Prime
                            Minister that, although he had only a few moments left, he wanted to
                            hear the Prime Minister's views on what was happening in South China
                            today, what were the real conditions in North Vietnam, how much longer
                            could they hold, and who was the real key in bringing them to the
                            conference table. On China, the Prime Minister thought that the
                            activities of the Red Guards were indeed a very serious development. He
                            thought the situation could not remain as it was in North Vietnam very
                            long. Their difficulties were very serious. They had very little food;
                            they had to work at night. They could not sustain this very long. Asked
                            who was boss in Hanoi, the Prime Minister pointed out that Ho Chi Minh
                            was largely a figure-head whose name and reputation were used. The most
                            influential members of the collective leadership were, in his opinion,
                            Pham Van Dong and <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName>. The
                            former, an intellectual, was more reasonable than <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName> who was very militant and
                            impressed with the past victories. As an indication of the difficulties
                            in North Vietnam, the Prime Minister cited <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0547"/>the fact that the North Vietnamese no longer aided the
                            Pathet Lao; this aid was now given solely by the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the Prime Minister reiterated what he had said publicly on
                            other occasions that if South Vietnam became communist tomorrow, Laos
                            would be lost. Laos stood as a buffer in front of Thailand, Laos was
                            actually the front line for Thailand. The Prime Minister fully agreed
                            with the President that if the U.S. pulled out of Vietnam, it would not
                            take the Chinese too long to be in Honolulu.</p>
                        <p>The President again assured the Prime Minister that he was giving him his
                            full personal support in the efforts he was making.</p>

                                from Vientiane, October 15, the Embassy reported that officers
                                commanding the majority of the neutralist forces had connived with
                                rightist <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> military officers to

                                Le</persName> would be unfortunate, particularly while Souvanna in

                        <p>2. We are arranging to contact Souvanna in New York and inform him along
                            lines of your para 6,<note n="3" xml:id="d260fn3">The Embassy suggested
                                in paragraph 6 that Souvanna be apprised of the threat in general

                            should also contact Sisoumang in similar vein, since it would be
                            impossible to explain to Souvanna why we credited report sufficiently to
                            alert him without informing designated acting MinDef.</p>
                        <p>3. Also believe it would be useful to spread knowledge of rumored “coup”
                            somewhat more widely if you can arrange to do so without
                            attribution.</p>

                            difficulty” or other means. An alternative would be for <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> rep to accompany him back to Vang
                            Vieng which should disrupt plan at least to some degree, unless you feel
                            this would betray knowledge of plot.</p>

                            been launched to test U.S. reaction, and caution obviously called for.
                            Agree it is important to avoid appearance of taking sides (though it is
                            somewhat difficult to see clearly who is on whose side). Though fully
                            cognizant of Neutralist commanders' grievances toward <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> over money, faltering
                            leadership, etc. and of their desire to improve future career prospects,
                            we have not been aware of breach in close personal tie between Col. Sing
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> that would permit
                            former to consider participation in plot that might involve his leader's
                            death.</p>
                        <p>6. We continue to believe a reasonable long-range goal is to work for
                            orderly reincorporation of Neutralist forces into National forces, at
                            pace and in ways that will remove rivalry and mutual suspicions, offer
                            security for future of able officers and troops, and preserve Neutralist
                            label at least for time being. Disappearance of distinctive Neutralist
                            units, however reorganized and subordinated to National command, would,
                            we think have general political disadvantage and might lead to further
                            defections toward Deuane or <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> from among
                            those who have followed <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>
                            so long in pursuit of principle of neutrality.</p>
                        <p>7. Recognize that if <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> has
                            come to be serious and unmanageable impediment to progress in this
                            direction, we cannot indefinitely prop him up in place despite his
                            apparently constructive interest in socio-economic development of Vang
                            Vieng area. Unable judge from here to what extent his retention as
                            Commander is still of symbolic importance to civilians in Neutralist
                            areas and to line troops, as distinct from disillusioned staff and
                            selfseeking unit commanders. But forcible removal of once popular if now
                            tarnished leader (especially by violence and with <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> connivance), under circumstances
                            reminiscent of departure of <persName corresp="#p_SL1">Siho</persName>
                            and other such incidents, would clearly be disruptive and increase sense
                            of personal insecurity among Lao to which you have recently referred.
                            Without implying we would step in to stop contemplated action, your
                            conversations dealing with reported move against <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> should make clear we not
                            endorsing any such attempt to solve a basic political problem by
                                force.<note n="5" xml:id="d260fn5">On October 17 <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> left Vang Vieng for

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MBD1">Bill</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Shortly after I received your message about General Starbird's Task Force
                            728, I received a message from <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John
                                McNaughton</persName> asking me to send my comments on the Task
                            Force proposal to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in Saigon.<note n="2" xml:id="d261fn2">Neither
                                found.</note> I have not yet received the Task Force papers,<note n="3" xml:id="d261fn3">For a summary, see <ref target="#d265">Document 265</ref>.</note> but John gave me a synopsis of the
                            Project as it has emerged; and, of course, I had an original
                            acquaintance with it during the meetings which <persName corresp="#p_TMD1">Max Taylor</persName> and I had with the JASON
                                Group<note n="4" xml:id="d261fn4">A group of scientists working at
                                Department of Defense's Institute for Defense Analysis to study
                                bombing and a barrier as a means of checking infiltration. See

                        <p>Unfortunately, I was extremely pressed at the time
                                <persName>John</persName>'s message arrived and had only a couple of
                            hours to consider and compose a reply which would get to Saigon in time
                            for the <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> review with
                            Westmoreland. Consequently, my cable<note n="5" xml:id="d261fn5">Telegram 2256 from Vientiane, October 14. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, ORG 7 <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>)</note> was
                            rather abrupt and lacking in nuances. However, I enclose a copy to give
                            you the general thrust of my reaction.</p>
                        <p>Since this message was sent, I had the pleasure of about two hours of
                            discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John McNaughton</persName>
                            here in Vientiane. During that talk, I was able to flesh out my thoughts
                            in greater detail and give him a better appreciation of my views. He was
                            not unreceptive to my perspective and promised to relay my thoughts
                            faithfully to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. He suggested that I write them out in a long
                            letter to you so that you could then discuss them with him in
                            Washington. Hence, this epistle.</p>
                        <p>First, I start from my impression of the group who developed these
                            proposals. They are, as you know, physicists, mathematicians, and a few
                            engineers. They are relatively unsophisticated in politics and quite
                            innocent of knowledge affecting Southeast Asia. The views of most of
                            them are underlain with a considerable emotion about war—and especially
                            about war “between white men and yellow men.”</p>
                        <p>The thrust of their effort was to create a proposal which would provide
                            the United States with a plausible excuse to terminate the war and
                            evacuate Vietnam. Some members of the group (one father and son
                            combination <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0550"/>in particular) were
                            quite intellectually dishonest in the presentation of “facts” and “cost
                            estimates” tailored to their emotions. Others were clearly
                            disinterested. In the Santa Barbara session, neither Jerry Weisner nor
                            George Kistiakowsky was present, so I don't know their views. However,
                            Murray Gell-Mann, who was clearly the most intelligent among those
                            present, took me aside and described the proposal as totally
                            impractical. He said, however, that he would not resist it because he
                            could think of nothing better to suggest.</p>
                        <p>Starting from this inauspicious beginning, I move into some of the
                            considerations I mentioned in my cable, and some others which I omitted
                            because I was not sure of the political context in which the proposal
                            was being considered. After my talk with <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John McNaughton</persName>, I feel I can comment more directly on
                            these aspects. I shall therefore repeat here what I told him in
                            Vientiane.</p>
                        <p>It is my feeling that barriers ought to be considered in two con-
                            texts—either as tactical measures to be used during the current fighting
                            phase, or as enforcement measures to define a territory which is
                            politically as well as militarily defensible when the war ceases. It
                            might be possible for one barrier to serve both purposes, but I frankly
                            can't see it in this case. There is nevertheless no reason why planning
                            and even execution could not go forward simultaneously on both types of
                            barriers.</p>
                        <p>Let us take the tactical barrier first. <persName>John</persName> tells
                            me some consideration is being given to establishing this, and then
                            suspending the bombing of North Vietnam. He seemed surprised to learn
                            that I felt, under such circumstances, that we would soon also have to
                            suspend bombing in Laos. It is not only a question of “uncovering” us by
                            the absence of North Vietnam raids. It is also a question of exposing
                            Souvanna to increasing pressure from Soviet and other sources to force a
                            suspension in Laos. There is moreover the factor of predictable public
                            opinion pressure in the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the sorts of barriers Jason proposes, south of the Seventeenth
                            Parallel, and in Laos, accompanied by a bombing pause, would cause all
                            sorts of problems here. It would first lead, in my judgment, to
                            suspension of bombing in Laos. This, of course, would destroy the
                            concept of the vehicle barrier as proposed. It would also make it very
                            difficult, but perhaps not impossible to maintain the personnel barrier.
                            However, it would generate pressures to disclose that a personnel
                            barrier exists in Laos so that you could sustain the logic of your
                            bombing pause. This in turn would raise pressures for the elimination of
                            that portion of the personnel barrier in Laos. In short, I think the
                            Jason barrier plus the bombing suspension is a non-starter for Laos.</p>
                        <p>If the barrier is mounted in the place Jason suggests, but bombing
                            continues, the political problem would be less. However, we would then
                            encounter some practical military considerations. Our Tiger Hound,
                            Cricket, <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> and Road Watch operations
                            are a barrier in being. They <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0551"/>are naturally not 100% effective, but they did cost the opposition
                            about 1000 trucks destroyed last year and may have been a large measure
                            in his decision to go straight across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. It is too early in the season to predict, but we
                            currently see very little moving down the Ho Chi Minh trail. This may
                            mean, that from a cost effectiveness viewpoint, our “barrier” has
                            already had a considerable measure of success.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, we would be loathe to drop it in favor of a new and
                            untested type of barrier which is highly dependent on gadgetry. There
                            may be some resentment from the Stateside “experts” that my “experts”
                            are willing to second guess them on subjects in which the former hold
                            doctorates. But, I submit that my team knows more than anyone else
                            outside Hanoi about the Ho Chi Minh trail. I am therefore most reluctant
                            to consider trading a road watch team for a sono-buoy sensor, or an
                                <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> strike controller for a sack of
                            “gravel.” In short, we have and will continue to have grave doubts about
                            the technical feasibility of this scheme.</p>
                        <p>There is also one consideration here. If we assume that our current
                            “barrier” operations in Laos have directed the enemy into the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, then we can assume that a new barrier
                            along the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> will cause him to consider
                            going back into Laos again. Naturally, from our parochial viewpoint,
                            this hardly represents progress. Moreover, from an international
                            political view, it is a better wicket to have North Vietnamese
                            aggression directly across the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> than
                            it is to have it routed through Laos. This shade of difference has
                            significance, especially in our relations with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Now, if we still wish to talk about barriers in the “tactical” sense, for
                            use at the current stage of the war, I have a counterproposal. This
                            proposal would have both a military and diplomatic dimension. I have
                            discussed it in some detail with <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John
                                McNaughton</persName> and he may already have relayed it to you.</p>
                        <p>It envisages the erection of barriers, both personnel and vehicle, in
                            North Vietnam. The principal line of blockage would be across the narrow
                            neck of North Vietnam, south of Vinh, from the coastal region up into
                            the badlands. This would be a broad strip, sown with “gravel”, mines, or
                            any other beastly devices Jason can devise. It would be laid either by
                            air or by large naval vessels lying off shore, which could deliver their
                            charges by naval gun-fire or by rockets. Everything south of this region
                            (that is to say, Route Package One) would be subjected to the sort of
                            anti-vehicle barrier treatment proposed by Jason for Laos. And all this
                            deviltry would be coupled with a suspension of bombing in North Vietnam
                            north of these barriers.</p>
                        <p>Now, the virtues of these proposals are (1) that they appear to be a step
                            in de-escalation (2) they address themselves to infiltration heading
                            both into Laos and into South Vietnam (3) they permit our current
                            operations to continue both in Route Package One and in Laos. The
                            drawbacks <pb n="520" xml:id="pg_520" facs="0552"/>are the same as those
                            associated with any bombing pause: they permit the enemy to relax a bit
                            and they ease the pressures on the rail link with China. However, they
                            are a better combination by far then current Jason proposals, if those
                            are to be associated with a bombing pause.</p>
                        <p>If, on the other hand, the Jason proposals are not to be associated with
                            a bombing pause, then they are still a better proposition because they
                            add a new dimension of deterrent in an area which does not degrade
                            anything we are currently doing. Therefore, if we are hell-bent to do
                            the Jason business in any event, this is the way I would like to see it
                            configured.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I would direct a few words to the other type of barrier—the one
                            we might consider to define, demarcate, and “hermetically seal” the
                            territory of South Vietnam after a settlement has been reached. This,
                            too, was discussed at Santa Barbara and is perhaps not as far-fetched as
                            it may sound. I think it is clear that, at the current juncture of
                            events, it would be extremely costly, both in terms of men and money, to
                            erect a physical barrier along the borders of South Vietnam, to include
                            the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, plus the Lao and Cambodian
                            frontiers. However, this might not be total folly if and when the
                            fighting reaches some level that would free our forces for such an
                            exercise. If we are to begin such barrier, I would suggest that the
                            mountainous regions along the Cambodian border would be the best place
                            to start. It would be internationally defensible and perhaps even of
                            some interest to <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName>. In
                            fact, it might be a better occupation for all General Larsen's troops
                            than their current game of watchful waiting.</p>
                        <p>Having put all these thoughts on record, I would like to repeat what I
                            said in my cable to you on this subject. I would like a full hearing on
                            any final decisions with respect to this matter and would probably want
                            to participate in the decision. It seems to me to be a matter which
                            could so thoroughly affect our whole posture and all our operations in
                            Laos that it would need the most careful consideration by all concerned
                            with this country.</p>

                        <p>2420. 1. At 0830 hours this morning General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>'s 5–28 pilots from Savannakhet launched bombing and
                            staffing attacks against Phone Keng and Chinaimo in what appears to be
                            last ditch effort by Ma to salvage his own position and force change in
                            General Staff.</p>
                        <p>2. We received word an hour ago that <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>, assisted by Nouphet, had placed General <persName corresp="#p_OR1">Ouane</persName> (traveling in south) and General

                        <p>3. I have seen <persName corresp="#p_LI1">Leuam</persName>, who entirely
                            ignorant of developments, and have asked him to contact Boun Oum, who is

                        <p>4. T–28's continue to fly over city as we draft this and machine-gun fire
                            heard near Embassy. Bombs have hit barracks near <gloss target="#t_AOC1">AOC</gloss> at Wattay as well as Chinaimo and Phone Kheng.</p>

                            Special Task Force now approaching point of determining and making
                            commitments for assets needed to lay barrier in South Vietnam and Laos.
                            Current planning is to have this barrier installed and in operation by
                            September 15, 1967.</p>
                        <p>Present concept is to deny vehicle traffic no motorable roads in Laos in
                            what is generally the “Cricket Area.” This zone is to extend from just
                            south of the 17th Parallel (in vicinity of Route 9) north to just beyond
                            Mu Gia Pass. To be effective the several alternative routes must be
                            covered. The area is expected to extend westward into Laos as far as
                            Mahaxey at the northwest limit and as far as Moung Sen at the southwest
                            extreme. There can of course either be “sanitary” areas for known
                            friendly populations or resettlement of friendlies outside the denial
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The concept, to be effective, will involve (1) daily seeding of
                            short-lived self-sterilizing mines on and adjacent to selected vehicle
                            routes which are capable of blowing a truck tire or causing loss of a
                            foot, (2) biweekly laying of sensors along the same routes, (3)
                            continuous visual and sensor surveillance aircraft over the area in
                            question, and (4) very quick reaction air strikes where traffic is
                            detected (probably barring case-by-case approvals from Washington,
                            Saigon or Vientiane—implying that advance approval of a broad class of
                            cases will have to be given). Each of these—especially the first and
                            fourth—involve large investment of resources and obvious political
                            implications.</p>
                        <p>The concept, as it applies to Laos, also includes the denial to enemy
                            foot infiltration traffic of the network of trails skirting the western
                            edge of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. This area is a strip 20
                            km deep running west from the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to
                            Route 90 northwest of Tchepone. Denial techniques will include mining of
                            traversable terrain, positioning of air surveilled sensors in the more
                            likely avenues of infiltration, e.g. Se Bang Hieng river valley east of
                            Tchepone, and fast reaction air strikes on detected intruders.</p>
                        <p> ASD/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> understood you to say that—if we
                            kept publicity down, if we continued bombing North Vietnam, and if we
                            avoided friendly populations—you thought the probability was better than
                            70% that Souvanna would go along with a program of this kind.</p>

                        <p>2457. 1. <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> has had a little difficulty
                            pulling itself together this morning after disruptive events of
                            yesterday and last night. We kept them fully posted during the night as
                            our T–28 chickens were being coaxed to roost in Thailand, but they
                            blacked out the city and otherwise lost sleep over the events.</p>
                        <p>2. Cabinet and military officers met this morning at 10 am. Meeting heard
                            formal report from General Bounphone concerning events in south and sent
                            messages to King and Souvanna reporting that all has been resolved. Lao
                            Ministry of Information, which has functioned surprisingly well
                            throughout, put out radio broadcast reassuring public and restoring
                            calm. City is now fully returned to normal.</p>
                        <p>3. During this morning's meetings, <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> made vigorous plea to demand extradition of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and Bounleut from Thai
                            authorities. Due to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName>'s expeditious handling of matters with Thai
                            Government and as result triangular telephone conversations he and I had
                            last night through General Bond in Udorn, we were able get word to Leuam
                            in advance that Thai would preserve their time-honored tradition of
                            refuge for these latest Lao immigrants.</p>
                        <p>4. Nevertheless, there occurred the usual Vientiane contretemps when Boun
                            Oum was erroneously informed that I had arranged with <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0558"/>the Thai to extradite <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> and Bounleut. Boun Oum had impression
                            he was double-crossed and was even most unhappy with congratulatory
                            message he received from the King. I think I have straightened him out,
                            although I haven't been able to see him yet because I have been
                            intermittently busy giving away bride at a wedding this morning.</p>
                        <p>5. I have, however, talked at length with <persName corresp="#p_LI1">Leuam</persName> and have discussed how best to proceed from here.
                            He agrees that we must make best effort brush all this rapidly under
                            carpet, avoid recriminations, and reconstitute the air force. He,
                            naturally, wishes to defer decisions until Souvanna returns tomorrow,
                            but he and I have agreed on common line to present to Prime
                            Minister.</p>
                        <p>6. Above and beyond this, I have some views about <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>. As I have reported earlier, he is a
                            very sick man. At the same time he has done as much in the past for the
                            US as any individual in Laos. Therefore, I have no desire to toss him
                            out like a twisted lemon. He is a far different case from <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> and merits some proper
                            consideration from us.</p>
                        <p>7. Therefore, I intend to propose to Souvanna that we go ahead with our
                            commitment to give him hospital treatment, quietly in a US facility.
                            (Among other things, this will remove him from possible contamination by
                                <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>.) After that, I would
                            like to see if we can arrange a job for him with Air America, or other
                            friendly organization, as a civilian pilot in Vietnam or Taiwan. He has
                            no personal means and has a family to support.</p>
                        <p>8. As for Bounleut, I have no plans and feel he is basically the
                            provocateur who led <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> astray. He
                            will doubtless drift into the <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> retinue and that ought to serve him right. I only
                            feel sorry to wish him on the Thai.</p>
                        <p>9. Our next immediate task here is to reconstitute the air force.
                            Happily, our strategy succeeded in preserving all our T–28's from damage
                            and safely in either US, Thai, or Lao hands. We will have no problem
                            reassembling them into a strike force. We have at least 28 and perhaps
                            more than 30 qualified T–28 pilots. We have no basic differences with
                            General Staff about organization plans (we constantly did with <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>). The only thing we will lack will be
                            the fighting spirit that <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>
                            certainly had. Sourith is no tiger and showed definite traces of a
                            yellow streak in yesterday's events. But, since he's the best we have to
                            work with, we'll start over again with him first thing Monday
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>10. On balance, this was a big week for <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>. Not only did <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> hang himself by yesterday's actions, but <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>, by his obvious involvement in
                            this affair, finished himself off as well. All military regions, plus
                            the Neutralists, check in on side of General Staff. There is practically
                            no dissident left, unless one counts <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang
                                Pao</persName>. However, both of them have played their hands fairly
                            smoothly and we will continue to urge <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang
                                Pao</persName> towards reconstruction.</p>
                        <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0559"/>
                        <p>11. The repercussions of all this turmoil on the political scene are a
                            little difficult to gauge until all the smoke clears. However, <persName corresp="#p_LI1">Leuam</persName> has clearly lost prestige and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> has gained. Whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> will add his new
                            gains to Souvanna's political fortunes or preserve them for some game of
                            his own may turn out to be the most interesting question in town over
                            the next few weeks.</p>
                        <p>12. All these fascinating digressions should add special embellishment to
                            the annual North Vietnamese dry season offensive, which our intelligence
                            reports indicate we can expect to begin within the next few days.</p>

                                need for Thai-piloted T–28 support in Laos, and queried if that
                                activity could be eliminated or reduced without loss of combat
                                effectiveness. The Departments also wanted to know the date when

                                T–28 operations. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. On basis enumeration just completed of Lao T–28 pilots now and to
                            become available, Country Team concludes that Thai piloted T–28 support
                            for air operations in Laos will be required until about July 1968. In
                            making this estimate we have assumed that war in Laos will continue at
                            present level of intensity in intervening period and that requirements
                            for T–28 operations will remain unchanged.</p>
                        <p>2. Fundamental factor in any phase out of Thai support is availability
                            qualified Lao T–28 pilots. Although some 42 have been trained since <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0561"/>1964, pool is presently reduced
                            to 24 as result of combat and training losses and flight of ten pilots

                        <p>3. Accretions to this pool of 24 are estimated as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. General <persName corresp="#p_SDS1">Sourith</persName> believes that
                            at most seven (7) of ten pilots who left with <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> might be rehabilitated. He very likely is optimistic

                            begun).</p>
                        <p>B. Of the seven pilots now in training at Udorn (not including one who
                            died in training crash Nov 7) six seem likely to graduate at end of
                            December.</p>
                        <p>C. A new group of ten Lao are projected to begin training at Udorn in
                            early January. If past averages hold, about seven will graduate in July
                            1967.</p>
                        <p>4. If 3 (a), (b) and (c) are all realized and if there is no further
                            attrition in present group of 24, pool will thus stand at 44 pilots in
                            July 1967. Using <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> suggested ratio
                            of 1.5 pilots per T–28, pool of 44 pilots could efficiently man about 30
                            T–28's. We would expect, however, to have fleet of between 44 and 48
                            T–28's at that time, about 36 to 38 to which would normally be available
                            for operation (others in maintenance). Thus six to eight aircraft in
                            fleet would be idled for lack of pilots if Thai were not employed beyond
                            next July.</p>
                        <p>5. We are therefore led to conclude that Thai should not be phased out
                            until pool of Lao pilots numbers at least 55 to 60. Allowing for
                            attrition, this number will not be reached until about July 1963, or
                            after graduation of two further trainee groups beginning training in
                            July 1967 and January 1968 respectively.</p>
                        <p>6. There are of course imponderables in this calculation. If Water Pump
                            (Det 606 <gloss target="#t_ACS1">ACS</gloss>) had additional aircraft
                            and staff and if Lao recruitment of likely trainees could be
                            accelerated, training classes could be enlarged above current optimum
                            number of ten per class. Resources to accomplish this enlargement are
                            not, however, presently at hand.</p>
                        <p>7. Re para 2C reftel. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> aircraft are
                            already performing well in interdiction role and in more heavily
                            defended areas of northern Laos. They have not ordinarily been used in
                            close support role, where T–28's piloted by Lao or Thai function to
                            especially good effect because of ability to communicate in same
                            language with ground forces. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss>
                            assets are therefore best viewed as supplementary to rather than as any
                            fully satisfactory substitute for T–28 operations.</p>
                        <p>8. Re para 2D reftel, we assume use of Thai pilots is stimulus for Lao to
                            make maximum effort to take over all T–28 operations in Laos.
                            Fundamental reason we continue to need Thai, however, is inadequacy of
                            pool of Lao pilots as indicated above.</p>

                        <p>9. As for resumption of Thai T–28 operations from Vientiane base (State
                                77053—notal),<note n="3" xml:id="d268fn3">Dated November 1.

                            precisely where obstacles to resumption lies. Both Lao and Thai insist
                            they are prepared to have operations resume, and we hope to sort this
                            one out shortly.</p>

                        <p>1. In anticipation your interdepartmental review of situation in Laos and
                            of our policies toward this troubled, strategically placed Kingdom, we
                            must admit that even from our vantage point we view future as most
                            unpredictable. This sense of caution has been installed in us by very
                            recent experiences. Last June (Embtel 1371)<note n="2" xml:id="d269fn2">
                                <ref target="#d238">Document 238</ref>.</note> during visit of
                            Deputy Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>
                            it was consensus of Lao, and of foreign observers as well, that there
                            had been marked progress on military and rural development fronts
                            coupled with attainment of relative political and economic stability.
                            All this seemed to augur well for continued progress, however slow,
                            toward objectives we share with Lao that they achieve true independence
                            and prosperity despite their precarious geographic position and their
                            continuing confrontation with North Vietnamese aggression.</p>
                        <p>2. Since June we have witnessed a succession of events, some unheralded,
                            some inherent in earlier developments, which have dealt damaging <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0563"/>blows to these expectations.
                            Statisticians will dispute placing any monetary value on effects of
                            Mekong flood in September, but by conservative estimates damage to rice
                            and other crops, to roads, and to buildings, plus loss of labor and
                            resources which otherwise could have been applied to constructive
                            enterprises, must reach in neighborhood 20 to 25 million dollars. In
                            economy so relatively unproductive and marginal as that of Laos, this is
                            loss which will be felt for at least two years.</p>
                        <p>3. Political currents since June have been as unpredictable as those of
                            the Mekong. A National Assembly was dissolved because neither <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>, nor his young and old
                            opponents in Assembly, sought the compromise of their differences which
                            was always within reach. As a result, elections are again in offing with
                            uncertain outcome and with widespread doubt that they should even be
                            held. Predictions of any sort as to their results are hazardous. There
                            followed ouster by Neutralist Colonels of General <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>, whose effectiveness as a
                            leader had steadily deteriorated during past several years as result of
                            a failure to command, a loss of self-confidence, and personal excesses.
                            No sooner had he taken refuge in Thailand than General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> bombed several military sites in
                            Vientiane in a futile, senseless, and self-destructive attempt to settle
                            what he regarded as crucial odds with Generals <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone</persName>, et al.</p>
                        <p>4. Reason applied to these developments can only retire in confusion, but
                            the tolerant Buddhist view of life and destiny which most Lao share
                            probably permits them to accept these events as beyond any power to
                            alter or control. They thus probably look to the future undismayed by
                            the past.</p>
                        <p>5. We have little alternative but to do likewise, setting our course as
                            best we can in an uncharted future. But there are certain stars to steer
                            by.</p>
                        <p>(A) First is premise that it is essential that Mekong Valley, together
                            with most other territories now under <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> control in Laos, be retained in friendly hands. This
                            implies continued military and paramilitary assistance to Laos as long
                            as enemy actions make them necessary. At current levels these
                            commitments reach some 140 million dollars per year but involve only a
                            handful of US military personnel and a minimum of US prestige. Since any
                            substantial escalation of the war in Laos would have serious political
                            (and possibly military) drawbacks, we think our military involvement is
                            at about its most practical level in relation to present enemy threat
                            and our political objectives. This level of assistance is in our
                            judgement indispensable and irreducible.</p>
                        <p>(B) Second is our conviction that as a small, landlocked, undeveloped
                            country with powerful neighbors Laos is most likely to enjoy prosperity
                            in a status of neutrality guaranteed if possible by outside powers. This
                            concept underlay Geneva Agreements of 1962 and despite NVN and other
                            violations it remains in our judgement a valid prescription for <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0564"/>Laos. Present de facto division
                            of country could end in formalization of two Lao states, one under
                            Communist control, but friendly Lao still nourish hope that
                            reconciliation with NLHS will be possible if North Vietnamese aggression
                            ceases. Front lines, in north especially but also in south, are still
                            fluid, with significant friendly pockets in enemy held territory and
                            increasing defections from enemy military and civilian population.
                            Formal division of country, under these circumstances, would therefore
                            work principally to enemy advantage. Preservation of Laos as an integral
                            state appears still to be in our interest.</p>
                        <p>(C) Third star to steer by, given (A) and (B), is <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>. He is Lao who most
                            personifies 1962 Agreements, and with all his failings he is a true
                            Centrist -Neutralist, patriotically motivated, internationally
                            recognized. But at same time has condemned NVN aggression and has
                            authorized unpublicized US military actions which have made war more
                            costly to enemy in Vietnam and Laos. As long as Souvanna is at hold, we
                            can also anticipate he will preserve trappings of tripartite government
                            which visibly symbolize <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> fidelity to
                            agreements of 1962. These trappings are essentially (1) retention of
                            provisional government of National Union, symbolized especially by
                            safeguarding of four NLHS portfolios, including that of Prince <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName> as Deputy Prime
                            Minister; and (2) maintenance of some identifiable Neutralist or
                            Centrist presence in armed forces and political structure.</p>
                        <p>6. As long as Souvanna is in power he will probably be able to command
                            external respect as a spokesman for a neutral Laos. Soviet attitudes are
                            especially vital to his position, and he has taken renewed courage from
                            hospitable attitude displayed by Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName> since latter's return in
                            early November. Following conversation reported Vientiane 2971 (notal),
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador Warner had further long
                            session with <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName>
                            November 14. Latter fully accepted Warner's statements concerning
                            incidents affecting Generals <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName> and seemed prepared
                            to ride out new elections in expectation Souvanna is still fundamentally
                            non-aligned and anxious retain Soviet support, however tacit. At large
                            Lao reception November 15, Souvanna took <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName> aside for lengthy private but conspicuous
                            conversation, following which Souvanna told Ambassador Warner with some
                            elation that <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName> had
                            given him same impression of Soviet flexibility. This Soviet attitude
                            assumes some significance against background of <persName corresp="#p_KLG1">Kong Le</persName>'s current problems.</p>
                        <p>7. There are new indications of restlessness on part of Peking most
                            recently expressed in hard-hitting and authoritative mid-November
                            articles and broadcasts condemning Laos for espousing a two-China
                            policy, being too friendly to Taiwan, and supporting alleged US
                            aggression. But we doubt that these noises will result, as Bangkok press
                            has intimated, in withdrawal of recognition of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. ChiCom Ambassador <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0565"/>locally has had number of diplomatic illnesses in
                            recent weeks (Soviet November 7 celebration was one of them) but his
                            counselor has attended receptions in normal manner. ChiCom stands at the
                            Luang Fair Grounds, scheduled to open November 24, are still being
                            erected. There are thus no local signs that ChiComs (or for that matter
                            North Vietnamese or NLHS) contemplate a policy shift.</p>
                        <p>8. There remains, however, considerable dissatisfaction among Laos elite,
                            particularly younger men, that they are still “saddled” both with
                            Souvanna, whom they respect but for whom they feel no warmth, and with
                            vestiges of “tripartitism” which to them symbolizes foreign intervention
                            in Lao internal affairs and continuing restraint on their freedom of
                            political action. Fortunately the wiser among the Lao elite accept this
                            situation philosophically (<persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName>
                            and Ngon Sananikone, Tay Keolunagkhot, <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk
                                na Champassak</persName>, Inpeng Suryadhay, Outhong Souvannavone,
                            Sisounang Sisaleumsak, among others); and Souvanna continues to be
                            supported and “tripartitism” tolerated by key military leaders,
                            including Generals Ouan, <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName>. King Sa-vang, despite his cultivated
                            remoteness, is also exercising an increasingly constructive influence
                            over government affairs, and in a crisis, such as finding a successor to
                            Souvanna with none in sight, he would play a truly critical role. But
                            forces working for change, especially discontent of young Lao with
                            status quo grow increasingly strong and as last few months have proven
                            can follow unpredictable courses.</p>
                        <p>9. In an international context, Vietnam is the key, and success or
                            failure of our policies there will influence in large measure what
                            happens in Laos. The other key element is Thailand. One can scarcely
                            envision a happy or productive future for Laos without Thailand, and it
                            should be our objective to cultivate and facilitate a further
                            improvement in relations between them, particularly on such practical
                            questions as transit of cargo.</p>
                        <p>10. In sum, it does not seem to us that our policies toward Laos need to
                            take new directions, or bilateral programs now in being should be
                            continued, especially our critical important <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> effort (now of a magnitude of $55 million) and we
                            must seek to accelerate economic programs (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss>, NAM NGUM, etc.)
                            should also be preserved and encouraged. Flexibility in our analysis and
                            selection of political options is also essential, for Laos is, after
                            all, an evolving society, and our own policies must be responsive to
                            these changes.</p>

                        <p>1. The Department of Defense is seeking our approval of an expansion of
                            the Shining Brass Operations which <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> has proposed and <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have
                            supported. This calls for a permanent enlargement of the zone of
                            operations in Laos, consisting of a 20-kilometer wide strip on the Lao
                            side of the Laos/Vietnam border from approximately the seventeenth
                            parallel on the north to 165 15'N on the south. (See attached maps, Tab

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>2. Shining Brass operations on the Lao side of the Laos/South Vietnam
                            border were approved on September 20, 1965 and inaugurated on October
                            17. These limited, covert operations were confined initially to
                            penetrations by small, 10-man (later 11-man) teams including not more
                            than 3 US personnel to a maximum depth of 20 kilometers west of the
                            border for intelligence/reconnaissance patrols in the southern Laos
                            panhandle, a rugged, sparsely settled area. (This is the “Permanent
                            Zone”—see Tab A.) The teams were to conduct their operations so that
                            they would be undetectable, i.e., avoid contact with the enemy and/or
                            villagers and not engage in sabotage or harassment. Their roles were to
                            collect intelligence on enemy locations and to call in air strikes at
                            likely targets.</p>
                        <p>a. No Consultation with <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>—The Prime
                            Minister of Laos has on various occasions specifically told senior US
                            officials, including Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, that he could not and would not approve of
                            U.S. ground operations in Laos. In view of this stance, no attempt has
                            been made to inform him of Shining Brass and to obtain his concurrence.
                            These armed incursions, unauthorized by the Lao Government, are thus
                            territorial <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0567"/>violations of the
                            sovereignty of Laos, and, of course, violations of the 1962 Geneva
                            Agreements. The involvement of U.S. personnel is the element in this
                            program which creates greatest difficulty for us.</p>
                        <p>Shining Brass operations, therefore, from the beginning were to be
                            conducted in such a fashion that the possibility of exposure, both to
                            the Lao Government and/or to public attention, was minimized, that
                            is:</p>
                        <p>(1) penetration limited to a maximum of 20 kilometers from the border in
                            the southern sparsely-settled panhandle.</p>
                        <p>(2) 11-man teams, including not more than 2, later 3, Americans.</p>
                        <p>(3) no sabotage or harassment.</p>
                        <p>(4) avoidance of contact with enemy and/or civilians in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(5) infiltration by foot.</p>
                        <p>These operations were considered to be fairly safe from detection. Given
                            their limited character and the remoteness of the area it was also
                            thought that even if detected they would not have to be
                            acknowledged.</p>
                        <p>b. Expansion—During the past year, the essential cover from detection and
                            public identification has suffered steady erosion because of expansions
                            which we have accepted on the basis of strong pleas of military
                            necessity. Infiltration by foot was modified to permit infiltration by
                            helicopter up to a depth of 5 kilometers and, in September 1966, up to
                            12 kilometers. Although introduced as an option, when operationally
                            necessary, helicopter infiltration has been employed systematically.
                            Although the original ground rules prescribed avoidance of contact with
                            the enemy, as well as sabotage and harassment tactics, the
                            reconnaissance teams by June 1966 were burning isolated huts and small
                            villages and destroying livestock and food caches. They had by that time
                            captured five prisoners and killed 11 enemy. There have been an
                            increasing number of instances in which the reconnaissance teams have
                            revealed their presence and position by initiating fire against
                            suspected enemy personnel, presumably in exercise of team leaders'
                            responsibility to defend their units.</p>
                        <p>On June 20, 1966, the possibility of exposure was further increased by
                            approval for the inauguration of follow-up exploitation forces to strike
                            at enemy targets in Laos discovered by the reconnaissance teams. Ground
                            exploitation, however, was restricted to platoon-size (40-man) strike
                            forces with no more than 3 US advisors and limited to a penetration
                            depth of 10 kilometers and a duration of approximately five days.</p>
                        <p>On July 21, the area of operations for Shining Brass teams was
                            temporarily extended northward from the northern limits of the permanent
                            zone to the southern edge of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to
                            a depth of 5 kilometers west of the border (see Tab A), exclusive of the
                            enclave at Route 9 where a friendly Lao battalion (BV–33) is located.
                            The area, although rugged, is much more accessible, more heavily
                            populated and militarily most active. On September 24, 1966, a further
                            temporary extension north of Route 9 and <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0568"/>west from the border was approved in order to permit
                            reconnaissance in support of III MAF operations just south of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> in South Vietnam, scheduled from
                            September 17 to October 15. Of the seven targets proposed for this
                            extended area, two were disapproved by us because they were located too
                            far from the border and exposure of these missions would have made it
                            virtually impossible to avoid acknowledgment.</p>
                        <p>3. While the present memo is addressed to the proposal mentioned in para
                            1 above, you should be aware that the Joint Staff (<gloss target="#t_SACSA1">SACSA</gloss>) has also informally submitted to
                            us a proposed Memorandum of Agreement for Shining Brass. In addition to
                            advocating a greater delegation of control to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> than I believe we can accept,
                            the Draft would further extend the scope of operations by increasing the
                            size of forces, the US involvement, and the use of helicopters and
                            aircraft. These are matters we have not yet discussed with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and for which we lack supporting
                            justification. (The Draft further relates to the proposed extension of
                            Shining Brass-type operations to the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                            and North Vietnam, a proposal on which a separate memorandum is being
                            prepared.) Therefore, I recommend that you consider the Draft Memorandum
                            of Agreement to be for information only—it indicates clearly the
                            direction in which the military planners desire to move. I will plan to
                            consider it further with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> in the
                            light of the decision on the question posed in paragraph 1 above.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>4. The present <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposal would make
                            permanent the temporary (northern) extensions mentioned above and would
                            go further to the north and west. Such a substantial expansion of the
                            Shining Brass operational zone would bring into sharp relief the
                            fundamental problem of exposure. Significantly deeper penetrations into
                            this populated and militarily active area cannot remain concealed.
                            Already, in the permanent zone and in the temporary area, the frequency
                            of enemy contact and the rate of casualties are increasing. There is
                            possibility that four US casualties, lost in the northern area, may have
                            survived as captives. The enemy appears to be aware of most penetrations
                            within a relatively short time of the actual infiltration and has been
                            taking increasingly sophisticated countermeasures. During the month of
                            October, eight of the nine Shining Brass reconnaissance teams required
                            emergency exfiltration because of enemy attacks. The helicopters used
                            for both infiltration and exfiltration often encounter enemy
                            ground-fire. In at least one case, the enemy apparently spotted the
                            choppers during infiltration and laid an ambush at the Landing Zone for
                            the exfiltration run, including spiked stakes in the Zone itself. The
                            team suffered casualties and the helicopters were damaged during the
                            emergency exfiltration. In addition to the mounting casualties and risk
                            of additional losses of US personnel, it would appear, at this tempo of
                            operations, to be only a matter of time before <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0569"/>a helicopter is downed by enemy action
                            inside Laos. While this may be explainable at 4 kilometers from the
                            frontier, it is probably not so at 18, or adjacent to North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. We have agreed to these operations in an effort to meet <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> requests based on statements of
                            military need, believing that only on the basis of experience could the
                            degree of risk be determined. The experience has been that even in the
                            permanent zone the risk is greater than we anticipated and that with
                            each expansion of the area or in the scope and pace of operations the
                            risk intensifies. Because the area for which approval is now requested
                            is known to be heavily infested and of major importance to the enemy, we
                            believe the risk of exposure too high to be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>6. With the operations as they are presently conducted, i.e., even
                            without the expansion proposed by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, P
                            is deeply concerned about how to avoid acknowledging them should they
                            come to public attention. Under present circumstances it would plan to
                            use the guidance at Tab B. However, this line might not be usable in all
                            circumstances and would rapidly lose credibility for operations under
                            the proposed expansion.</p>
                        <p>7. US military authorities are, of course, deeply concerned over
                            infiltration through Laos. They consider the Shining Brass program
                            successful and its continuation, including the proposed extension,
                            essential for both intelligence collection and harassment purposes.
                            Their concern has been deepened whenever it appeared that enemy forces
                            might in fact be deploying on Lao territory for an attack against
                                US–<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> positions in northern South
                            Vietnam. The arguments bearing on these points are attached at Tab C. In
                            support of the extension to a 20-kilometer depth in the northern sector,
                            Joint Staff representatives have referred to evidence that a <gloss target="#t_PAVN1">PAVN</gloss> division-level structure may be
                            located in the area and that it cannot be expected to be within the
                            narrow 5-kilometer belt.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the military argument, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in September 1966 believed
                            that “the record of Shining Brass to date has not given much substance
                            to the military justification.” The Ambassador has repeatedly
                            recommended that Shining Brass-type operations would be more useful if
                            they were conducted near or in the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>,
                            or even in North Vietnam, rather than in Laos. We have reviewed in
                            detail the reports of Shining Brass operations in Laos from inception to
                            the present and believe that the Ambassador's assessment of achievements
                            there is generally accurate even though we fully appreciate the basis
                            for the concern of the US military. It appears clear, for example, that
                            these operations have not led to any significant interruption of the
                            infiltration efforts, although they have confirmed the presence of enemy
                            troops in this area, and may have given warning about movements into
                            Vietnam. Thus we accept the judgment that Shining Brass operations have
                            been militarily useful. Intelligence developed by the teams
                            unquestionably adds to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>'s total <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0570"/>picture of the infiltration
                            pattern, and air strikes associated with their missions have undoubtedly
                            added some harassment. The question is, does the value to the military
                            justify the high risk of serious damage to US credibility and to our
                            objectives in Laos? Unless such an extension of Shining Brass is
                            essential to the safety of US forces in Vietnam or to their conduct of
                            the conflict there, which we doubt, we believe the answer must be
                            negative.</p>
                        <p>8. One way to resolve the present difficulty might be to obtain Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s
                            agreement to public acknowledgment. However, he has told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that he could not
                            take the international pressure that would accompany the entry of US
                            ground forces into Laos. As a consequence, the Ambassador has determined
                            that he could not raise the proposition with Souvanna, who has, in
                            effect, told him in advance that the answer would be no. The Ambassador
                            believes that the chances of getting Souvanna's approval are “absolutely
                            zero.”</p>
                        <p>9. A second possible course might be to extend these operations without
                            Souvanna's knowledge and approval. However, as noted above, exposure is
                            already a great risk and would, we believe, become a virtual certainty
                            if this proposal is approved. The discredit and embarrassment to the US
                            Government stemming from public knowledge of these unauthorized
                            operations, in violation of Lao sovereignty and the Geneva Agreements,
                            would be intense. An immediate consequence of exposure would be the loss
                            of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s
                            credibility with Souvanna. Moreover, exposure would contrast sharply
                            with recent assurance given Souvanna by both the President and the
                            Secretary personally that the US Government firmly supports him and his
                            policies. The Prime Minister's position, in fact, might become
                            untenable. He would certainly be criticized by the Soviets (whose
                            continued support of the 1962 settlement he and we consider essential)
                            and by non-communist friends of Laos. He is already under pressure (for
                            other reasons) from Lao conservatives, and in the face of such a
                            compromise of his neutralist commitments and convictions might
                            resign.</p>
                        <p>10. There are alternatives to the proposed expansion of the operating
                            areas under present arrangements which we would be willing to support
                            but in which the Joint Staff (<gloss target="#t_SACSA1">SACSA</gloss>)
                            has not expressed interest thus far:</p>
                        <p>a. Further extension of the growing <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            program of roadwatch and guerrilla teams (Hardnose and Kha) already
                            operating within Laos. By the end of 1966, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> expects to have 40 such teams operating in the eastern
                            panhandle area along the infiltration routes. Use of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> teams is politically attractive
                            because</p>
                        <p>1) there are no U.S. advisors with the teams on their missions; and</p>
                        <p>2) the teams are based in Laos, not South Vietnam, and are made up of
                            personnel whose presence raises no political questions.</p>
                        <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0571"/>
                        <p>Since 1963, when I first approved the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            operation, we have viewed it as an attractive alternative (even though
                            less satisfactory from a military point of view) to U.S. military
                            involvement on the ground in Laos, and subsequent expansion of the
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operation has been endorsed by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>b. The organization of Shining Brass-type teams composed, however,
                            entirely of personnel of the Indo-Chinese area. Provided the depth of
                            US-piloted helicopter penetration were not extended beyond the present
                            5-kilometer limit, the operation of such teams would not involve
                            substantial risk of exposing US activities, which is the root of our
                            concern.</p>
                        <p>There is a third alternative, in which the Department of Defense has
                            expressed some interest:</p>
                        <p>c. Use of Shining Brass reconnaissance teams only (i.e. no follow-up)
                            within the proposed extended area provided</p>
                        <p>1) we return to the original Shining Brass operating rules, with no
                            sabotage or harassment and with strict avoidance of contact with enemy
                            and/or civilians in Laos;</p>
                        <p>2) use of helicopters confined to the present 5-kilometer depth; and</p>
                        <p>3) air strikes are authorized only after exfiltration of teams.</p>
                        <p>This would give us great difficulty and would continuously present us
                            with a high risk of exposure. Therefore we do not recommend it, although
                            individual cases might be considered if the military situation
                            demands.</p>
                        <p>Recommendations:<note n="3" xml:id="d270fn3">For the decision to extend
                                the scope of Shining Brass as reported to the Embassy, see <ref target="#d277">Document 277</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. I recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. State not concur in the proposal to expand the permanent zone of
                            operations for Shining Brass.</p>
                        <p>b. The 5-kilometer strip from the northern edge of the present permanent
                            zone to the southern edge of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                            (exclusive of the BV–33 enclave at Route 9) continue to be considered a
                            temporarily approved zone within which Shining Brass reconnaissance team
                            operations only may continue, provided proposed missions (new or
                            repeated) are reported to State in advance in periodic schedules or by
                            individual message.</p>
                        <p>c. We indicate to Defense our desire to accord <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> the greatest flexibility consistent with Souvanna's
                            position and our posture in Laos, saying that State would be prepared to
                            support alternatives (a) and (b) in paragraph 10 if Defense desires.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0572"/>
                        <p>d. Finally we should state that the arrangements outlined in paragraph 10
                            (c) could be carried out in case of grave need, on a case-by-case basis
                            with prior Defense and State approval.</p>

                        <p>Our share would be $13.8 million, roughly $100,000 more than our
                            commitment for <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1966. The balance would

                            <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss> was initiated in 1964 by the IMF

                            Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese caused expenditures far greater than the
                            government could collect in revenue. The annual budget deficit
                            threatened serious inflation and the country's political and economic
                            stability. Lao military operations directly support our security

                            Secretary Fowler is concerned about the balance of payments effect.
                            However, he sees no satisfactory alternative immediately available to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary Fowler recommends that the $4.9 million installment of the
                            commitment which would come from <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968
                            funds be offered Laos on a conditional basis to permit an overall review
                            of alternative options. This is agreeable to State, <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_BOB1">BOB</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>I recommend your approval of the <gloss target="#t_CY1">CY</gloss> 1967
                            commitment of $13.8 million to <gloss target="#t_FEOF1">FEOF</gloss> on

                        <p>1. Summary: In the few days before the election campaign closed on 31
                            December 1966, the role of the military is still dominant although
                            military leaders have never coalesced. Military commanders and their
                            candidates are strongest in military regions one, two and four. In the
                            third and fifth military regions, the election fight is more wide open.
                            This is particularly true in the third military region where Deputy
                            Prime Minister Leuam Insisiengmay is attempting to lead a bloc in open
                            opposition to Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>. Souvanna has patched together various
                            arrangements with regional leaders and has used General Ouan Rathikoun
                            to influence Military Region One and as his liaison to Military Region
                            Two. Souvanna has worked with <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk na
                                Champassak</persName> to reach an accommodation with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk Somly</persName> in Region Four
                            and then has attempted to split the political right by making a deal
                            with <persName corresp="#p_PS2">Phoui</persName> and Ngon Sananikone in
                            Vientiane, Borikhane and Khammouane Provinces. His compromises with
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and the Sananikones have for the
                            time being checked General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith
                                Abhay</persName> and may cut into <persName corresp="#p_LI1">Leuam</persName>'s power. With these shaky agreements and
                            understandings to provide the props, Souvanna's compromise list of
                            candidates, largely the selections of regional commanders, will probably
                            prevail and a substantial majority in the Assembly will consist of those
                            who have made some sort of a deal with Souvanna; but the new Assembly
                            and elected candidates will have merely formed the framework in which
                            the political struggle in government-controlled Laos will be slugged
                            out. The regional leaders have compromised with local interests and have
                            in several key cases wittingly incorporated anti-Souvanna deputies with
                            leadership potential into their lists, even over Souvanna's protests.
                            Souvanna has, however, succeeded in eliminating several offensive
                            deputies and the French-backed Neutralist faction in Luang Prabang has
                            largely evaporated. Although the military leaders will probably serve as
                            a braking force on irrational acts of the Assembly, there remains the
                            raw material and sentiment in the Assembly to develop a bloc of
                            political opposition to Souvanna. This will be a rightist movement; and,
                            if it were well led, it could develop into a political organization
                            which eventually could prove a challenge to Souvanna's leadership.</p>

                        <p>On the whole, the situation is much better than anyone might have guessed
                            a few years ago.</p>

                        <p>When the National Assembly was dissolved early last fall and elections
                            for the new Assembly were scheduled for January 1, the Department
                            expressed concern over developments and asked my views on probable
                            consequences. At that time, I speculated that Souvanna would survive,
                            although his neutralists would suffer; and that the Lao army would
                            emerge as the most powerful and successful sponsor of the new Assembly
                            members. I assumed that the army would be acting very largely under
                            General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>'s
                            inspiration.</p>
                        <p>Most aspects of this reckless prophecy have indeed come to pass as the
                            result of last Sunday's election. Souvanna seems intact and at least for
                            the time being in better political shape than ever; his neutralists are
                            a shadow of their former selves; and the army has emerged as the most
                            important force behind the scenes. However, in one significant respect,
                            my prophecy was well wide the mark. <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> has not functioned as the primary inspiration
                            of military politics. If anything, he has been very largely isolated and
                            his influence restricted to the Fifth Military Region.</p>
                        <p>It is, I believe, instructive to examine why <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> slipped. If I were to fix any one causative
                            event, I would suggest the October 21 abortive coup of General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>. This coup was, of course, aimed
                            primarily at <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0576"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, who had harassed
                            General <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> into extremis. And
                            although <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName> failed in his
                            immediate quixotic goal of killing <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>, he nevertheless can take some satisfaction
                            that his rash attack eventually resulted in cutting <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> down to size.</p>
                        <p>This consequence came about partly because other generals in the army
                            were shocked by the disruption which <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>'s harassing tactics had produced, and partly
                            because, in the aftermath of <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Ma</persName>'s
                            affair, <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> very decidedly
                            “blew his cool”. He lashed about so extravagantly that he produced
                            reactions. My own rather conspicuous rebuff to him on that occasion made
                            it plain to the other generals that <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> was not our “chosen instrument,” as some
                            rumors had pretended. All these factors therefore stirred the other
                            generals to more foresighted and more deliberate action in the political
                            field to forestall <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>'s
                            expected initiatives. They also caused the Sananikone family, which has
                            always had a healthy respect for American power, to decide that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> was not necessarily
                            the best standard bearer for the family's fortunes.</p>
                        <p>The final result has been that General Ouane Rathikoun, General Van Pao
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> Somly
                            (especially General <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName>) with
                            their broad-based regional influences, have developed a political
                            presence that overshadows <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and leaves him very decidedly just one among
                            the group. The case of General <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> is particularly interesting, since he has always
                            been (with good cause) the most respected officer in the army. The fact
                            that he has now also emerged as a political figure in his own right
                            (largely assuming the neglected mantle of Prince Boun Oum) provides a
                            new dimension which we will wish to study and upon which we will wish to
                            comment with some deliberation.</p>
                        <p>Before closing this retrospection, I feel I should emphasize two caveats.
                            A) <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> may be currently
                            somewhat down, but his ambitions are by no means out, and he can still
                            be expected to press for greater leverage. B) The new Assembly, girded
                            as it is by the army and rather loosely pledged to support Souvanna, is
                            a totally untried animal. We don't know how seriously its members will
                            take their pledges to Souvanna, how united the United Front will be, or
                            how the army will exercise its newly acquired political influence.</p>
                        <p>These several unknowns should assure us that political life in Laos will
                            remain interesting.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">In telegram 4177 from

                        <p>1. The Department of Defense has requested our approval to initiate the
                            operational phase of Project Popeye in selected areas (map at clip)<note n="2" xml:id="d274fn2">Not printed.</note> along the infiltration
                            routes in North Vietnam and southern Laos. The objective of the program
                            is to produce sufficient rainfall along these lines of communication to
                            interdict or at least interfere with truck traffic between North and
                            South Vietnam. Recently improved cloud seeding techniques would be
                            applied on a sustained basis, in a non-publicized effort to induce
                            continued rainfall through the months of the normal dry season.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Background</p>
                        <p>2. A test phase of Project Popeye was approved by State and Defense and
                            conducted during October 1966 in a strip of the Lao Panhandle generally
                            east of the Bolovens Plateau in the valley of the Se Kong River. The
                            test was conducted without consultation with Lao authorities (but with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s knowledge
                            and concurrence) and, to the best of our knowledge, remains unknown to
                            other than a severely limited number of U.S. officials.</p>
                        <p>3. During the test phase, more than 50 cloud seeding experiments were
                            conducted. The results are viewed by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            as outstandingly successful.</p>
                        <p>(a) 82% of the clouds seeded produced rain within a brief period after
                            seeding—a percentage appreciably higher than normal expectation in the
                            absence of seeding.</p>
                        <p>(b) The amount of rainfall induced by seeding is believed to have been
                            sufficient to have contributed substantially to rendering vehicular
                            routes in this area inoperable. Since the end of the rainy season, the
                            communists have failed to undertake route repairs and there has been no
                            vehicular traffic.</p>
                        <p>(c) In one instance, the rainfall continued as the cloud moved eastward
                            across the Vietnam border and inundated a U.S. Special Forces camp with
                            nine inches of rain in four hours.</p>
                        <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>(d) <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> scientists consider that the
                            experiment demonstrated a capacity to raise and maintain rainfall under
                            controlled conditions to the level at which the land is saturated over a
                            sustained period, slowing movement on foot and rendering the operation
                            of vehicles impracticable.</p>
                        <p>4. In our view, the experiments were undeniably successful, indicating
                            that, at least under weather and terrain conditions such as those
                            involved, the U.S. Government has realized a capability of significant
                            weather modification. If anything, the tests were “too
                            successful”—neither the volume of induced rainfall nor the extent of
                            area affected can be precisely predicted. The only absolute control,
                            therefore, is after the fact, i.e., to halt cloud-seeding missions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion</p>
                        <p>5. The present <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposal would grant
                            authority for the conduct of cloud seeding activities on a sustained
                            basis. For designated areas in North Vietnam, it would mean taking
                            advantage of the present northeast monsoon (the “Crachin”) to increase
                            normal rainfall. The objective is to inhibit overland vehicular movement
                            and to reinforce the bottlenecks already created at stream crossings by
                            the bombing of bridges and ferry installations. With respect to Laos,
                            the objective is to extend rainfall through the dry season (which began
                            in November and continues through April or May), keeping the ground as
                            near the saturation point as possible and obstructing traffic that
                            normally fords streams during the low water period.</p>
                        <p>6. The assets required for this program are estimated to be very small:
                            extra personnel for existing weather reconnaissance aircraft based in
                            Thailand plus two C–130 aircraft modified for cloud seeding operations
                            with crews, plus supporting personnel. The initial request totals only
                            33 additional personnel for assignment to bases in northeast Thailand.
                            The cost of the equipment and seeding materials is so low as to be
                            insignificant.</p>
                        <p>7. A corollary phase of the operation would be to conduct intensified
                            weather reconnaissance and additional experiments in weather
                            modification over international waters in the South China Sea, from
                            Philippine bases—one principal objective being the development of
                            techniques to dissipate cloud cover as well as to induce abnormal
                            rainfall.</p>
                        <p>8. The proposal differs, in our judgment, from previous weather
                            modification efforts by:</p>
                        <p>(a) being operational rather than experimental</p>
                        <p>(b) having military rather than economic or welfare purposes. Approval
                            could thus be considered to constitute a precedent-making decision with
                            major implications for the future. It raises questions in the political,
                            legal, economic, biological, and psychological spheres, many of <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0579"/>which cannot be answered
                            adequately in advance of conducting the operation but which are
                            discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>9. Urgency. <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> wishes to inaugurate
                            operations at once. A prompt decision would (1) enable 7AF to take
                            maximum advantage of present rainy season conditions along coastal areas
                            of North Vietnam, and (2) permit operations in Laos with minimum loss of
                            time between the end of the rainy season and efforts to recreate rainy
                            season conditions along the infiltration routes. With respect to Laos,
                            the period of heaviest anticipated infiltration activity is at hand.</p>
                        <p>10. Impact in Target Areas. The target areas within North Vietnam are
                            areas of relatively high population density including the town of Dong
                            Hoi, but at least for the first part of the operational period the areas
                            would be undergoing rainy season conditions even in the absence of the
                            proposed operations. It seems reasonable to conclude that the effect of
                            the operation, at least during the normal time span of the wet monsoon,
                            will fall within the range of weather and terrain conditions already
                            experienced at least from time to time. If the operation continued into
                            rice harvest periods, crop damage could result unless seeding was
                            temporarily suspended. The target areas in Laos, by contrast, are
                            characterized by relatively low population density, but the proposed
                            program would drastically change the weather patterns over the next few
                            months—creating to some extent rainy season conditions during normal dry
                            weather periods.</p>
                        <p>The increased rainfall will inhibit military movement more than civilian
                            movement (to the extent the former is more dependent on motor
                            transport). The effect on military traffic will be to exacerbate
                            difficulties already experienced, to a degree dependent on the extent to
                            which rainfall can in fact be increased on a sustained basis.</p>
                        <p>The experimental phase of Popeye, conducted during the rainy season, does
                            not provide sure indicators of the extent to which wet weather
                            conditions can be re-created during normally dry periods. But <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> believes the induction of rainfall to
                            be feasible, and to the extent its predictions are realized there would
                            be an undoubted favorable military effect. The road network over which
                            vehicular movement takes place in Laos, despite improvement as well as
                            extension over the past two years, passes through many low-lying areas
                            and is vulnerable to interruption in bad weather, in narrow defiles,
                            along hillsides, and at innumerable stream crossings where bridges do
                            not exist or have been destroyed and where fording is normal practice.
                            Interruption of road traffic would not only retard the normal rate of
                            movement but would also force concentration of trucks that would be more
                            vulnerable to aerial attacks at points known to us because we created
                            the bottlenecks.</p>
                        <p>Infiltration of troops, on foot, cannot be halted by creation of wet
                            monsoon conditions, although there would be some retardant effect. The
                                <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0580"/>same effect would, of
                            course, apply to the freedom of movement and morale of friendly
                            roadwatch and guerrilla teams operating in the same area.</p>
                        <p>The impact on civilian population will be much the same, in kind, and
                            greater in degree, than that discussed below with respect to areas
                            outside the target zones. The psychological impact will be perhaps
                            greater than any other effect, particularly when conditions
                            characteristic of the rainy season are unexpected.</p>
                        <p>11. Impact Outside Target Areas. In North Vietnam the impact of
                            successful Popeye operations outside the designated area should be
                            slight. The added rainfall would reach the sea over short distances in
                            the coastal areas where operations would take place or would occur in
                            the mountainous border area that is sparsely populated by tribal
                            peoples. There would likely be some spill over in the form of increased
                            rainfall west of the target areas.</p>
                        <p>There would be some hypothetical effect of an adverse nature in Thailand
                            where, during the northeast monsoon, normal rainfall might be somewhat
                            diminished as the distance west of the mountains along the Vietnam-Laos
                            border increases. However, as a practical matter, rainfall in the dry
                            areas of northeast Thailand is so slight in this season that any
                            difference resulting from the proposed operation is not likely to be
                            either discernible or meaningful in terms of the water table.</p>
                        <p>In Laos, there will likely be discernible effects to the west of the
                            proposed areas of operation, toward the Mekong River. These effects
                            cannot be quantified but give us some concern. If the operations
                            approached the goal of keeping the infiltration routes impassable, they
                            might be substantial. Project scientists estimate that it might be
                            necessary to induce rainfall of up to six inches per month, once the
                            ground was saturated, to keep it in that condition. The following are
                            the types of effect foreseen:</p>
                        <p>(a) In areas where rain falls out of season, the life cycle of plants and
                            animals may be affected. Villagers may unwisely seek to alter planting
                            seasons in the face of uncertainty as to the future implications of the
                            weather changes they experience. If there is heavy and persistent rain,
                            it is possible that more fundamental ecological change may occur, e.g.,
                            in the formation of fungi and growth of bacteria which are ordinarily
                            subject to control by the alternation of wet and dry seasons. Although
                            rice production would not be affected by operations during the next few
                            months, cultivation of secondary crops could well be adversely affected
                            in limited areas.</p>
                        <p>(b) Downstream from the areas of rainfall, there will be effects on the
                            water level, diminishing as tributaries broaden toward the Mekong.
                            Unless monitored to limit induced rainfall to the amounts needed to
                            attain project objectives, intensive sustained operations could produce
                            serious localized flooding. Even at the required tempo of operations, it
                            seems <pb n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0581"/>probable that there will
                            be changes in normal water flow. Farmers, for example, who normally move
                            during the dry season across country, through dry stream beds or through
                            shallow fords, may be inconvenienced if not endangered by the unexpected
                            rise of water. In view of the uncertainty as to the extent to which
                            wet-season conditions are likely to be created, we should assume in
                            acting on the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposal that there
                            will be appreciable consequences outside the target areas.</p>
                        <p>Project scientists are satisfied that the proposed operations would not
                            induce disasters in the form of large and uncontrolled storms. But with
                            respect to Laos, at least, the more successful the operation proved to
                            be with respect to its military objectives, the greater would be our
                            uneasiness with respect to the likelihood of unwanted side effects. The
                            outside estimates of the range of effect of the seeding of a single
                            cloud is an area 50 by 100 miles. If not large meteorologically
                            speaking, any such range would be sufficient to carry the impact into
                            heavily populated friendly areas.</p>
                        <p>12. Consultation. There are thus legal, and perhaps moral or
                            philosophical, aspects to the question whether the US should utilize the
                            capability we seem to have developed to alter weather conditions
                            significantly. We cannot lightly assume responsibility for unilaterally
                            altering climate, and possibly landforms, in other sovereignties, and
                            particularly for initiating weather warfare with an uncertain extent of
                            injury to civilian populations. The Legal Adviser, I understand, has
                            undertaken a comprehensive study of the legal implications of weather
                            modification—a project that cannot be completed in time to affect the
                            decision on the pending proposal. Your decision should, however, be made
                            in the light of these uncertainties.</p>
                        <p>With respect to North Vietnam, we believe that as an interdiction measure
                            Popeye operations would be less harmful to the population and area
                            affected than bombing.</p>
                        <p>With respect to Laos, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has approved the project and indicated he would
                            not plan to consult Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName>. His concurrence, however, was based on an
                            assumption that the proposed operations would be conducted under
                            conditions comparable to those of the experimental phase. We believe
                            conditions would be different, notably in that ground saturation might
                            occur during normally dry weather periods and, if successful, be
                            sustained indefinitely. We do not believe a program of this import
                            should be launched in a friendly country without the knowledge of
                            responsible authority, in this case the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>13. Possible Publicity. The <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> proposes
                            to conduct the project under conditions of strictest secrecy, noting
                            that publicity would create vulnerability to communist charges of US
                            manipulation of weather, in the affected areas or elsewhere. We believe
                            the consequences of exposure <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0582"/>would be more profound and widespread than this statement suggests.
                            One probable consequence is that many Lao and Thai might immediately
                            attribute to US experimentation the disastrous Mekong flood of September
                            1966. More irrationally and perhaps with less certainty, there might be
                            many occasions in which uninformed groups in non-communist as well as
                            communist nations would blame the US for climatic abnormalities with
                            which we had no connection. There are apparently still enough people who
                            blame nuclear experimentation for freakish weather phenomena to justify
                            great caution in this regard. We see no way to quantify the
                            political/psychological burden the US might be required to bear in the
                            future but it must be considered a factor relevant to your decision.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, it seems highly unlikely that such operations could
                            remain secret indefinitely, and our assumption should be that they will
                            become known. In the first place, the altered weather will be
                            observable, in contrast to the experimental phase conducted during
                            normally rainy periods. Disclosure of planned weather experiments in
                            India would make it likely that the connection would become apparent.
                            Secondly, the possibility of a US seeding aircraft being downed cannot
                            be discounted. Thirdly, there is virtually no aspect of military
                            operations in Southeast Asia which has not over time become the subject
                            of leaks or at least of speculation in the press. The possibility of
                            incurring a severe psychological handicap is therefore one of the
                            problems we foresee in connection with the operation.</p>
                        <p>Even though the adverse impact might be less if the operations were to be
                            announced than as if they simply became known, we believe it is
                            preferable that security controls be maintained as long as possible. The
                            principal advantage of this operation, from the security standpoint, is
                            the relatively small number of individuals involved. Nevertheless, we
                            should be prepared to respond to disclosure by acknowledgment and to
                            anticipated charges by arguing that the action was a more humanitarian
                            attempt to reduce aggression against South Vietnam than undertaking
                            bombing, or firing rockets and guns. But we should anticipate that this
                            line would not satisfy critics both national and international, and it
                            is possible that the issue could be brought before the UN. If the
                            reaction were bad, we could anticipate being blamed for atypical weather
                            phenomena in other areas, whether we were responsible or not, and being
                            accused of using the Vietnam conflict for another type of
                            experimentation with unorthodox and “illegal” methods. The history of
                            communist campaigns against “germ warfare” and chemical warfare might be
                            repeated.</p>
                        <p>14. Military Effect and Counter-Effect. As previously stated, the results
                            of Operation Popeye should be to add a further impediment to the
                            infiltration and support effort moving from North Vietnam through Laos
                            and into South Vietnam. It is not possible to predict to what degree <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0583"/>this infiltration will be
                            impeded by Popeye; however, as a minimum, even if the flow of men and
                            materials is not reduced, Operation Popeye should force the North
                            Vietnamese to pay a heavier price for what they are able to move.</p>
                        <p>The question naturally arises as to the extent to which the North
                            Vietnamese and Viet Cong might be able to turn this relatively simple
                            technique against us in the current conflict. The present conflict
                            appears to offer a unique opportunity to employ cloud seeding techniques
                            without serious possibility of retaliation in kind. This is based on the
                            fact that successful use of the technique on a scale that could be
                            militarily significant requires almost unrestricted use of the air over
                            the target area. In addition, we are not as dependent on moving large
                            numbers of people and tonnages over long, restrictive and fairly
                            rudimentary roadnets which would be vulnerable to this technique.</p>
                        <p>While the possibility of effective counter-action in the present conflict
                            may be small, the initiation of cloud seeding as a military measure may
                            well have serious long-range military implications. In essence, it would
                            establish the precedent for altering weather and even climate for
                            military purposes. At some future time, in some as yet unforeseen way,
                            this could prove to be militarily disadvantageous to the US. It is
                            difficult to accept the premise that lack of precedent alone would stop
                            some future use of measures for altering weather or climate should they
                            give promise of providing a militarily significant advantage. But the
                            political consequences of “first use” could prove, as in the case of
                            nuclear weapons, highly relevant to any subsequent efforts to control
                            application of the technique by agreement.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> wrote the following

                        </p>
                        <p>1. That you approve initiation of Phase II of Project Popeye, with the
                            proviso that use of weather-modification techniques be considered still
                            in the experimental phase until additional data are available on the
                            effects. We propose to select among the areas proposed by Defense those
                            which are of highest military priority but to exclude areas of
                            relatively heavy population. We would thus concur on the assumption that
                            Defense experts believe there will be a substantial military benefit
                            from seeding operations limited to the areas authorized. To that end I
                            will, if you agree:</p>

                            the understanding that additional areas among those proposed can be
                            considered on the basis of experience or that operations can be
                            immediately interrupted if the side effects become unexpectedly adverse
                            or criticism too heavy to bear;</p>
                        <p>(b) Obtain <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> understanding that weekly

                        <p>1. As Department aware, Chief of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>
                            General Staff General <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone
                                Sananikone</persName> has nourished for some years idea of obtaining
                            from US, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] or South Vietnamese sources funds, equipment, and

                            infiltration routes in Laos Panhandle.</p>
                        <p>2. Conversations he held Jan 15 in Saigon (see reftel) are a further
                            development of this idea. Two days later, on January 17, <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone</persName> held another meeting, this time
                            in Vientiane, with Deputy <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> Commander

                                19).<note n="3" xml:id="d275fn3">Not further identified.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Reftel asks us to comment specifically on proposal advanced by Oudone
                            in Saigon that he be provided external assistance to recruit, train,
                            equip, and deploy some 1800 Lao commandos (three battalions) in
                            operations against corridor.</p>
                        <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0586"/>
                        <p>4. We of course already have under way in Panhandle under <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> sponsorship, commando and roadwatch
                            operations, which employ Lao, Kha, and other local inhabitants in
                            clandestine operations designed to harass enemy along infiltration
                            routes and to facilitate air interdiction. These operations have grown
                            steadily over past year and now encompass some 3500 effectives with
                            steps underway to recruit and train an additional 500 men. Directed by
                            US paramilitary experts, these operations are highly sophisticated,
                            employing helicopters and other airlift and communications equipment and
                            operational techniques of most advanced sort. They have enjoyed success
                            thus far precisely because they have emphasized highly centralized
                            control of operations, rigorous recruitment and training, and
                            sophisticated techniques.</p>
                        <p>5. US resources are in our judgment being very effectively employed in
                            this program which is itself still in a stage of expansion. To create a
                            parallel commando structure of sort apparently envisaged by General
                                <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone</persName> would therefore be a
                            redundant, competitive, and less efficient use of scarce resources. Lao
                            manpower of potential commando quality is in especially short supply, as
                            problems General <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> is
                            currently experiencing in effort attract Lao into <gloss target="#t_GM1">GM</gloss>-21 fully indicate. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            has also experienced problems in obtaining and motivating suitable Lao
                            recruits.</p>
                        <p>6. These practical considerations in our judgment effectively rule out
                            extension at this time of any US military support to program being
                            advocated by General <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone</persName>.
                            Without our support, we seriously doubt that Lao, even with Thai and
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> assistance, can mount efficient
                            program of this sort.</p>
                        <p>7. We therefore believe <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone</persName>
                            should not be encouraged in this project<note n="4" xml:id="d275fn4">In
                                telegram 9309 from Bangkok, January 23, the Embassy in Thailand

                                force for the time being, but it suggested that <persName corresp="#p_OS2">Oudone</persName> not be discouraged from
                                discussing the idea further with the Thais and South Vietnamese. At
                                some point, the Embassy suggested, ground forces might be required
                                to fight North Vietnamese regulars in Laos. At that time Asian

                            our disapproval would of course have to be carefully considered; and it
                            could well be we should make no move until our support is formally

                                not to discourage Thai-South Vietnamese-Lao consultations, but at
                                the same time it was important not to encourage the idea that the

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Ref A stresses importance the NVN have placed on the infiltration
                            routes in the Loatian Panhandle and concludes that the enemy is making
                            his main infiltration effort through that area. Specific restrictions
                            hindering effective military operations to counter this enemy effort are
                            enumerated and the recommendation made that political and diplomatic
                            sectors seek accommodations which will eliminate or temper these
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>2. It is recognized that during the past two years there has been a
                            gradual removal of restrictions and increased authorization for military
                            operations in the Laos Panhandle. During the same period the enemy use
                            of this area as the route of infiltration and support for his aggression
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> has increased rapidly. New roads
                            and trails have been completed, concealment and camouflage improved and
                            work crews enlarged and increased. The influx of men and materials has
                            increased <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0588"/>despite considerable
                            air effort expended to hinder infiltration. The gradual removal of
                            restrictions has not kept pace with the rapid build up and use of the
                            infiltration routes by the enemy.</p>
                        <p>3. It is evident that the reluctance to remove certain restrictions and
                            to authorize increased freedom of action in military operations is based
                            primarily on political considerations. The importance of these
                            considerations is recognized, but difficult to accept unless the
                            military threat is kept in proper perspective. I concur with Westy that
                            we have reached a point where more effective use of our military assets
                            is required not to reduce infiltration. We are using these assets to
                            their maximum under the guidelines authorized. What is required is a
                            lifting of certain restrictions now. The restrictions on ground
                            operations are the most severe at present. The limitations on the size
                            of Shining Brass, reduced area of operation and mode of ingress severely
                            restricts a capability that has proven to be most effective.</p>
                        <p>4. From background message traffic it is apparent that the restrictions
                            are not all AmEmb Vientiane originated. It is imperative, however, to
                            convince Bill Sullivan that we need his support in convincing
                            Washington. By separate message<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">Sharp's

                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>. It is possible that
                            our requirements for additional freedom of action have been too
                            fragmented. With the exception of the Shining Brass restrictions, the
                            other restrictions on an individual basis could be lived with. It is the
                            compounding effect of one on top of the other that seriously hurts.</p>
                        <p>5. It is suggested you delay action in Washington until Westy and I have
                            the chance to present our case to Bill Sullivan. The coming Baguio
                            Conference in early March will provide the opportunity. In the interim,
                            a convincing analysis can be developed on the extent operations are
                            hindered by these restrictions. Hopefully, this analysis will lead to
                            Bill Sullivan's support in improving the situation.</p>

                        <p>144166. For Ambassador from <persName>Bundy</persName>. Extension of
                            Shining Brass.</p>
                        <p>1. It has been decided at highest levels that we should extend scope of
                            Shining Brass activity as one of series of additional steps to improve
                            anti-infiltration efforts.</p>
                        <p>2. Decision is to change Shining Brass rules to permit:</p>
                        <p>a. Operations east of line bounded by coordinates XD430980 at Lao/NVN
                            border to XD430400 to XD700000 to YC010980; southern sector
                            unchanged;</p>
                        <p>b. Use of helicopters to full depth of above zone;</p>
                        <p>c. Use of exploitation forces to full depth of zone.</p>
                        <p>d. Multi-platoon operations up to three platoons in any single
                            operation.</p>
                        <p>e. Delegation of authority to approve operations to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, who will insure coordination
                            with Vientiane. (We will interpret this to mean that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> will “obtain concurrence of”
                            Vientiane.)</p>
                        <p>3. Without consulting Souvanna at this stage, desire your considered
                            views on effect such an extension of Shining Brass operations will have
                            on your essential relationships with Souvanna, and specifically request
                            your judgment on how problem can best be handled in terms of
                            consultation and public affairs aspects.</p>
                        <p>4. Our reading of situation is that up to now Souvanna is quite firm that
                            he would not consent to US ground operations in Laos. Having in mind his
                            apparent recognition that activities in eastern portion of panhandle are
                            beyond <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> capacity to control, with
                            most of friendly population removed, and on basis of clear evidence of
                            recent upsurge of infiltration at least in terms of truck traffic, do
                            you foresee possibility of his moderating his position? If not, what
                            outcome would you estimate if we were to decide simply to inform him
                            that we have now determined such steps to be necessary and beseech his
                            understanding? Would such a proceeding leave us in better or worse shape
                            than inadvertent exposure of operations without his having been
                            consulted or informed.</p>
                        <p>5. Your judgment on foregoing questions should be made in light of
                            following preliminary thinking on problem of press handling, together
                            with any further suggestions you may wish to advance:</p>
                        <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0590"/>
                        <p>a. There would, of course, be no announcement and standing instructions
                            to guard against disclosures would be reinforced.</p>
                        <p>b. If casualties, helicopter losses or other incidents lead to publicity,
                            we would make maximum effort to avoid acknowledgment by:</p>
                        <p>1) Declining comment on communist propaganda charges, if such were
                            original source.</p>
                        <p>2) Citing apparent navigational error if in proximity to <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> border.</p>
                        <p>3) Using <gloss target="#t_SAR1">SAR</gloss> activity as cover if
                            feasible.</p>
                        <p>c. If size of forces involved or location made such explanation
                            impossible, we should seek when possible to fall back on proposition
                            that border crossing occurred while forces in contact with NVN forces
                            and acting in self-defense.</p>
                        <p>d. In event of some hard to explain incident, we would decline comment
                            but talk to responsible press reps on deep background basis,
                            acknowledging that cross border reconnaissance being conducted,
                            explaining it essential we know enemy strenghts and movements in
                            critical area. For reasons analogous to our answering queries on air
                            operations by reference to “aerial reconnaissance,” we would say we
                            simply cannot confront Souvanna with pressures that would result from
                            official acknowledgment. We would thus propose to stop short of any
                            direct admission of violation. Recognize, however, that we would
                            henceforth be dealing with press on a somewhat different footing, by
                            tending to treat all activity in Laos in fashion in which questions on
                            air activities have been handled up to now.</p>
                        <p>5. Public affairs guidance will be developed for issuance at time
                            operational orders are released, in coordination with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and in light of your comments and
                            recommendations, which required by Saturday Feb. 25 Wash. time.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. A front channel message which I have just released provides the
                            military rationale and the necessity of installing an <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 at Site 85 in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. In November <gloss target="#t_CINCPACAF1">CINCPACAF</gloss> requested
                            authorization to develop a concept and plan for installation of an
                                <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 in northern Laos and
                            authorization to discuss this matter with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>. Ref A authorized <gloss target="#t_CINCPACAF1">CINCPACAF</gloss> to proceed with plans as
                            requested and directed that AmEmb Vientiane be provided with detailed
                            requirements. Ref A further urged the Ambassador's concurrence in this
                            proposal and assistance in selection of a suitable site. Ref B stated
                            that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s view
                            of installation of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> on Lao territory
                            was decidedly negative, but would authorize his representatives to
                            discuss proposal with <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss>
                            representatives. He further doubted that <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would be willing to accept such a major installation
                            for which they would consequently feel security obligations beyond their
                            means.</p>
                        <p>3. In early December Gen Harris<note n="3" xml:id="d278fn3">General
                                Hunter Harris, then the Commander of the Pacific Air Force.</note>
                            sent a message to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stating that due to the urgency of this
                            proposal and potential impact on the success of our air operations in RT
                            and <gloss target="#t_BR1">BR</gloss> he welcomed the opportunity to
                            provide a briefing to him at Udorn on 10 December 1966. His response
                            again restated his grave doubts that <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            would be willing to permit installation of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 in Lao territory and that he had even graver doubts
                            that Washington would even authorize him to propose such an installation
                            to the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>. Nevertheless, the Ambassador
                            agreed to meet <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> representatives
                            at Udorn and attend briefing.</p>
                        <p>4. At the briefing Ambassador expressed keen interest in the tactical
                            merits of an <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> in northern Laos but
                            again stated that he had misgivings about its political acceptability.
                            He expressed concern that the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would
                            most likely term such an installation as an indication that they would
                            in fact be proving direct support to offensive operations against NVN
                            rather than maintaining a neutral position and taking defensive <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0592"/>action only. No commitment was
                            made by Ambassador that he would provide further support to this
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>5. I discussed the subject with him during his visit en route to
                            Washington. He again emphasized his previous views. It appears that he
                            did not intend to give his full support to this proposal at State level.
                            Due to the significant increase in air operations capability which this
                                <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> will provide, I believe we must
                            attempt to obtain approval.</p>
                        <p>6. The information contained in my Genser message is a condensed version
                            of <gloss target="#t_PACAF1">PACAF</gloss> briefing and plan for
                            implementation. It has been concluded that we can support this plan. I
                            understand that HG <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> has already
                            taken action to repackage <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77
                            equipment for this type development and if not used as proposed, it will
                            still be valuable for contingency purposes. If go ahead is received, we
                            can have this <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> in operation in 30–45
                            days.</p>
                        <p>7. In summary, from a military viewpoint an <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> located in northern Laos would greatly enhance our air
                            campaign against the enemy. This is no cure-all by any means, but we
                            must do more now to increase the effectiveness of our air operations in
                            the northern area. The Ambassador's original objection was based on
                            doubts about the security of site which we have overcome to some degree
                            as expressed in other message. However, his later objections, which
                            shifted to the political angle, may or may not be completely valid. This
                            is something that will have to be flushed out at other levels.</p>

                                <persName>Bundy</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. I take note of highest level decision that we should extend scope of
                            Shining Brass rules to:</p>
                        <p>A) Add new northern zone of approximately 20 kms depth</p>
                        <p>B) Permit helicopter penetration to full depth</p>
                        <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>C) Allow exploitation forces and multi-platoon operations to three
                            platoons in any single operation to full depth.</p>
                        <p>2. First, let me say that, subject to my comments below, I think we can
                            live with this decision. At the same time, let me add that I believe
                            this is just about all the traffic will bear and that the line has to be
                            held at this point. I think it is important that this be clearly stated
                            at the outset because this new zone embraces some very hot territory
                            where three platoons could be lost in a 30-minute fire fight some fine
                            morning. At that stage, there will be a panicky demand for a battalion
                            to “rescue them.” This will have to be resisted and the risks and losses
                            will have to be borne as part of the original contractual
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>3. Next, I would like certain clarifications:</p>
                        <p>A) This zone covers the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> position at
                            Ban Houei Sane occupied by Lao Bao Batallion BV–33. We will want to work
                            out some operating rules to guide any activities contemplated near this
                            area.</p>
                        <p>B) It is not clear whether use of helicopters and exploitation forces
                            involves “full depth” of new zone or of entire Shining Brass zone.
                            Please stipulate.</p>
                        <p>C) Are three platoons to be committed simultaneously or consecutively? In
                            other words, is there a limit on total consecutive commitment to an
                            operation?</p>
                        <p>4. Re point 2e reftel. I wish to have “coordination” spelled out to mean
                            continuation of our current system. We have periodic meetings with
                                <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> which work out their programs,
                            we have “intent to launch” rules, etc. We want these preserved and not
                            changed. This includes possibility I may veto some operations for
                            political reasons as I have in the past. I intend continue exercise that
                            right as senior U.S. representative in Laos. I believe Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> would prefer it that way so
                            that his field forces are not operative without some exercise of
                            political judgment.</p>
                        <p>5. Your understanding of Souvanna's attitude outlined first sentence para
                            4 reftel is correct. There is, in my judgment, absolutely no chance that
                            he will change this position. This is a matter of major political
                            posture, in his view, and not affected by tactical circumstances.</p>
                        <p>6. Therefore, it would not be possible for me even to consider
                            approaching him either to “beseech his understanding” or to tell him
                            coldly that we have decided to go ahead in any event. His answer could
                            only be negative in any instance. He has let me know obliquely that if
                            thing ever came to this sort of point he would not wish to be informed
                            in any way.</p>
                        <p>7. Consequently, my judgment is quite clear that I will have to bear the
                            full responsibility for this sort of operation without sharing it with
                            Souvanna. This I am prepared to do.</p>
                        <p>8. However, in so doing, I feel I am entitled to complete cover from
                            Washington and other assorted spokesmen in public relations field. I
                            recognize and accept that Washington cannot buy the line of flat denial,
                                <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0594"/>which is what Souvanna
                            would want. At the same time, I see absolutely no reason to go beyond
                            the “no comment” stage.</p>
                        <p>9. Consequently, in rather elaborate discussion of press handling in para
                            5 reftel, I take inalterable exception to idea of “deep backgrounding
                            responsible press reps”. I would like assurance that this will not be
                            given further consideration and that no official will, in any
                            circumstance, acknowledge these operations even if “incidents lead to
                            publicity.” It is good for a spokesman's moral fibre to learn to stand
                            on “no comment”.</p>
                        <p>10. Finally, I wish to stress continuing need for rigid precautions
                            against “inadvertent” disclosure by casual talk, by letters which are
                            sent to next of kin after fatalities, etc. The men who run and operate
                            this program are an elite group of volunteers with an excellent record
                            of discipline and absence of self-seeking publicity. It would be a total
                            disservice to them and their mission if their operations were slipped
                            out because some public information official or staff section can not
                            maintain the same discipline in its far less demanding function.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">In joint State-Defense telegram 147744 to

                                guidance for questions about Shining Brass. The guidance stated that

                                should decline comment. If the incident occurred close to the <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> border (about 5 kilometers) and
                                became public, the spokesperson could suggest that it was an
                                inadvertent border crossing or pursuit of NVN/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>. Search and rescue activities could also be used as
                                a explanation when appropriate, but otherwise the response must be
                                “no comment.” There would be no “background” or “off the record”

                            their part. This opinion is confirmed in a more casual discussion which
                            Zbigniew Brzezinski had with Yuri Zhukov of Pravda. This underlines our
                            view that we should undertake as a matter of urgency a new line of
                            discussion with the Soviet leaders, particularly before they get further
                            involved in Vietnam. The closer they come to confrontation with us, the
                            more difficult it will be for them to retreat, and the harder it will be
                            to achieve a settlement.</p>

                        <p>We believe our response to the Soviets should be in the form of a

                            be answered head-on, but that the opportunity should also be taken of
                            pressing the Soviets to agree to serious and early discussions to
                            achieve a settlement of Vietnam of which the situation in Laos is only a
                            part.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the demarche itself, we suggest a reply along the
                            following lines:</p>
                        <p>We call Soviet attention to the fact that the North Vietnamese, by
                            refusing to withdraw their forces from Laos upon signing of the
                            Agreements in 1962 had, in fact, violated the Agreement from the very
                            moment it was to come into effect. In fact, the continuing presence of
                            the North Vietnam troops in Laos and Hanoi's continuing use of Laotian
                            territory for the dispatch of personnel and supplies to South Vietnam
                            not only created the present difficulties in Laos, but has largely been
                            responsible for the situation in South Vietnam as well.</p>
                        <p>We wish to submit a list of Hanoi's violations of the Laos Agreements
                                (attached).<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">Not found.</note> We would
                            remind the Soviet Government that, in addition to these substantial
                            violations, the spirit of the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>-Pushkin agreement has been broken. (The essence
                            of this agreement is attached.)</p>
                        <p>But no useful purpose can be served by an exchange of charges. The United
                            States has always supported and continues to support the carrying out of
                            the 1962 Agreements. We believe that it is important to take whatever
                            steps are necessary to restore and reaffirm them. Various attempts have
                            been made since 1964 to reconvene the Laos Conference of 1962. The U.S.
                            position remains that we welcome any opportunity in any forum which
                            could restore peace and stability to Laos. In particular, we support the
                            reconvening of the Laos Conference of 1962 and believe that this could
                            help make the Laos Agreements more effective.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>, and most especially Communist China, would probably
                            refuse to agree to reconvening the Conference at this time. We believe
                            that our stated readiness to attend such a conference would have
                            substantial advantages and few, if any, discernible disadvantages. If a
                            conference were held, the possibility of working out (coincidentally,
                            albeit outside the plenary sessions) a Vietnam settlement might be
                            enhanced. <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0598"/>If a conference could
                            not be held because of the refusal of Moscow, Hanoi and/or Peking, our
                            record would be good.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that you ask the British Co-Chairman to include in his
                            response to the Soviet demarche a strong pitch for reconvening the Laos
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we believe that our response to the Soviet demarche could be the
                            wedge to open up wider and more useful discussions with respect to
                            Vietnam. If you agree, we will prepare some further thoughts on
                            this.</p>

                        <p>On September 12, 1961, Pushkin told <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> that the Soviets truly desired a neutral
                            independent Laos on the model of Finland, and he specifically suggested
                            that the “Soviets could and would control North Viet Nam and continue
                            support Souvanna against possible Pathet Lao political or military
                            aggression.” His idea was that “Soviets to police Communist bloc to
                            assure adherence agreement, whereas British should police
                            non-Communists. He was particularly suspicious of Thailand and South
                            Viet Nam.” (Rome's 882, September 13, 1961)<note n="6" xml:id="d281fn6">Printed in <ref target="frus1961-63v24">

                        <p>On October 9 <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> reminded
                            Pushkin of this statement and asked how he intended to formalize the
                            understanding. Pushkin objected to a bilateral written agreement between
                            the Co-Chairmen, but expressed readiness to add a sentence to the
                            article on Co-Chairmen “which would give them responsibility for seeing
                            to observation of obligations by thirteen signatory states.”<note n="7" xml:id="d281fn7">See ibid., pp. 459–462.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>On October 13 Pushkin handed MacDonald a redraft of the Co-Chairmen
                            article which contained new language reading, “The Co-Chairmen will
                            exercise continuous supervision over the fulfillment of this Agreement
                            and will when appropriate consult with the members of the
                                conference.”<note n="8" xml:id="d281fn8">See ibid., p. 472.</note>
                            The Western Powers ultimately accepted this proposal with a slight
                            revision in text. Thus, the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>-Pushkin agreement is reflected in the third

                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The area of Laos between the
                            Tchepone-Se Kong River line and the Lao/Vietnam border continues to be
                            dominated by North Vietnamese forces and to serve as the principal
                            infiltration route and support area for enemy operations in South
                            Vietnam. The avowed neutrality of Laos and the US desire to conform as
                            closely as possibility to the provisions of the Geneva Accords have
                            limited friendly activity in the area to Prairie Fire reconnaissance and
                            exploitation missions, air operations, and some <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> road watch teams. Although all of these efforts have
                            gradually increased in scope and effectiveness, they are by no means
                            capable of stemming the infiltration or denying the use of the area.
                            Therefore, the search has continued for new or improved concepts to deal
                            with the problem without a drastic shift in policy toward Laos and
                            without upsetting that country's political and military balance.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) During the conduct of Prairie Fire
                            operations over the past few months, <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>'s Studies and Observations Group (<gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss>) has identified and assessed a
                            potential for the establishment of a friendly guerrilla force in the
                            Annamite Mountain Region of southern Laos. This potential is the Kha
                            tribal group which inhabits the area and is being exploited by the
                            enemy. Past experience with Montagnard groups in <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0600"/>Southeast Asia has shown that these
                            people will respond to Caucasian influence and can be developed into
                            guerrilla forces. Such a program could provide an important supplement
                            to the existing counter-infiltration effort at a low cost in men and
                            materiel and with a low risk of embarrassing the neutralist Government
                            of Laos.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has endorsed (reference 1b) a <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> proposal (reference 1a)
                            that <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss> develop and direct a guerrilla
                            program in southeastern Laos. The proposed concept of operations is
                            outlined in Appendix A hereto. Estimates at this time indicate a
                            potential force of some 3,000 men and a requirement for 135 US Army
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                            examined the proposed concept and consider that this course of action
                            should be pursued. Time consuming and carefully executed preliminary
                            activities such as contact, exfiltration, training, indoctrination,
                            reinfiltration, and recruiting must be undertaken before it will be
                            possible to determine the exact scope and area of the program. These
                            initial steps can be taken without an expansion of the Prairie Fire zone
                            or the commitment of additional US Army Special Forces into Laos.
                            However, this initial activity should not be undertaken without
                            conceptual approval of the over-all program.</p>
                        <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff recommend that:</p>
                        <p>a. The guerrilla warfare concept contained in Appendix A<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3">Appendices A–C are attached but not printed.</note>
                            be approved in principle for further planning, training, and discussion

                        <p>b. Execution of the preparatory phase (Appendix A, subparagraph 1b (1))
                            be approved.</p>
                        <p>c. Execution of the exploitation phase (Appendix A, subparagraph 1b (2))
                            be approved, subject to the successful accomplishment of the preparatory
                            phase and further assessment.</p>
                        <p>d. The phased PCS deployment to RVN of 135 additional US Army personnel
                            be approved.</p>
                        <p>e. Additional funds in the estimated amount of $2,000,000 be provided to
                            the Department of the Navy for the support of this program through the
                            fourth quarter <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1968.</p>
                        <p>f. A memorandum substantially as contained in Appendix B hereto, together

                        </list>
                        <p>1. You asked me to set out in a paper my estimate of the limitations
                            which face us with respect to extending military actions, both ground
                            and air, in Laos. I will list by subheading those various items which
                            have been proposed or contemplated, and give you my current best
                            judgment with respect to each.</p>
                        <p>2. Ground Action</p>
                        <p>A. Prairie Fire. As you are aware, the Prairie Fire zone has been
                            extended to accommodate a strip 20 kilometers deep from the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> down to the old Shining Brass area. It
                            then runs south to the Cambodian border in a zone which varies between
                            20 and 35 kilometers deep. The ground rules for operations in this zone
                            have been progressively extended until they now permit harassment
                            actions by forces which can number up to three “platoons”. These
                            platoons are a little larger then normal infantry platoons and have
                            three US advisers per unit. Helicopter infiltration and exfiltration are
                            also authorized; ambush and harassment are undertaken. A variation on
                            these operations is called the “<gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss>”
                            concept which combines strategic air, tactical air, and Prairie Fire
                            operations teams.</p>
                        <p>Currently, the opportunities afforded to <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> by the Prairie Fire rules considerably exceed their
                            abilities. There are far more targets and far more objectives in the
                            current Prairie Fire zone than there are Prairie Fire teams which could
                            operate against them. The <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> concept,
                            which concentrates teams on so called base areas, usually employs
                            everything that is available to <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> at any one time, leaving nothing left over for other
                            operations. Therefore, it seems to me that there is no reason even to
                            contemplate extensions in the Prairie Fire business unless and until
                                <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> is able to handle
                            everything it already has on its platter. This is particularly true with
                            the <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> areas, which are only being
                            nibbled so far.</p>
                        <p>B. Airborne Battalions. It is partly because of this over-extension of
                                <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> resources that
                            Westmoreland has proposed the possibility of introducing an airborne
                            battalion to undertake the operations originally <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0602"/>planned for Prairie Fire teams,
                            especially in the base areas. There are two great problems with this
                            proposal. The first is that it would probably destroy completely the
                            element of clandestinity which is an essential factor of Prairie Fire.
                            The second is that the airborne battalion would by definition not be
                            trained in those special skills which make the Prairie Fire teams
                            capable of operating in hostile territory. In other words, the airborne
                            battalion would very likely be decimated on its first operation.</p>
                        <p>Quite aside from the military factors it seems to me that jumping from
                            clandestine teams to conspicuous airborne operations would cross the
                            threshold of Souvanna's tolerance. He has made it clear that he cannot
                            provide positive acceptance to an overt ground force operating in Laos.
                            He would, therefore, have to make official and public protests against
                            this sort of operation with the consequence which I shall describe in
                            another part of this paper.</p>
                        <p>C. The <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> Division. As an extension on
                            the airborne battalion concept, Westmoreland has proposed the idea of an
                                <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ground division to be
                            introduced into Laos from the A Shau Valley. This division would invest
                            and hold the terrain which embraces the juncture of several supply
                            routes and complexes. It would be Vietnamese led, and Vietnamese
                            operated with American air and logistic support.</p>
                        <p>Obviously the objections which pertain to the airborne battalion would be
                            present in spades for the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            division. Moreover, given the consequences of taking and holding
                            territory, rather than just raiding into it, I feel that this one goes
                            well beyond the limitation of anything which really requires serious
                            consideration.</p>
                        <p>D. The Barrier. There are several facets to the barrier which would
                            concern Laos. Many of them have to do with terminology and public
                            relations. That is, if we announce that we are creating a barrier across
                            South Vietnamese territory from the sea to the Lao border and that we
                            intend by this barrier to seal the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>
                            hermetically, we introduce one set of problems. This set of problems has
                            to do with forcing the North Vietnamese to make an end run into Lao
                            territory. Souvanna has carefully refrained from saying exactly how he
                            would react to this, but he has indicated that it would cause concern to
                            him.</p>
                        <p>If we create a barrier from the sea to the foothills and then introduce
                            obstacles and electronic devices in the hills, we clearly cannot say
                            that the barrier hermetically seals South Vietnam at the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. This introduces a new set of problems,
                            but a set which is more tractable.</p>
                        <p>If we talk in terms of introducing a barrier from the sea all the way
                            across Laos to the Mekong River, we once again cross the threshold and
                            get beyond the range of anything which Souvanna could tolerate.</p>
                        <p>If I were to describe the sort of thing which I think Souvanna would
                            agree to, I would shape it something like this. The portion of our
                            obstacle course which extends from the sea to the foothills could
                            honestly be <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0603"/>called a barrier.
                            Everything westward of that cannot honestly be so called and we should
                            deliberately refrain from applying that label to it. Instead, we should
                            describe what we were doing west of the foothills as an enhanced program
                            of aerial interdiction against infiltration. In other words, we should
                            merely say that we are expanding and concentrating on exactly the same
                            sort of program in which we are currently engaged.</p>
                        <p>In such a concept, I believe we could seed a portion of Laos extending
                            westward from the end of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> at
                            least to the limit of the Prairie Fire zone. We could then turn
                            northward along the North Vietnamese border with a similar pattern of
                            devilish devices sown from the air. However, for political as well as
                            military reasons we should cover the entire strip from the foothills to
                            the Lao border in South Vietnam and we should also run this zone into
                            North Vietnam along the North Vietnamese/Lao border. At the very least
                            it should cover hill 1001 and the staging area at Vi Thu Lu.</p>
                        <p>Such an area could be sown with button bomblets, gravel mines, sensor
                            devises, and any other instruments developed for this purpose.
                            Immediately to the south of the border in South Vietnam and extending
                            into Laos to the depth of the Prairie Fire zone, <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> teams could be intermittently
                            deployed for monitoring purposes.</p>
                        <p>This is the sort of arrangement which I believe I could sell to Souvanna.
                            Anything beyond this would be highly questionable. As a matter of fact,
                            Admiral Mustin said the other day this sort of arrangement makes better
                            sense than all the other options which the Practice Nine group would
                            like to preserve for themselves. It seems to me, therefore, that you
                            should push to saw off the concept at this stage and not permit a myriad
                            of options which take no account of political considerations.</p>
                        <p>One final point on this arrangement. The <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> teams should be Vietnamese teams recruited and
                            controlled as they now are. If there is any reason for them to have to
                            stage through Thailand because of weather that could be arranged.
                            However, the introduction of Thai recruited teams run from Thailand
                            would be more than the traffic could bear. There are two reasons for
                            this. The first would be the fact that this sort of team would extend
                            the knowledge of Prairie Fire to still a fourth country and could result
                            in a consequence which is further than Souvanna can tolerate. The second
                            reason would be Souvanna's suspicion (and my own) that the use of Thai
                            teams is purely a device to attempt a later expansion into some sort of
                            Golden Eagle operation. This sort of thing would predictably bring the
                            Soviets and several more friendly countries down on our heads for a
                            margin of our satisfaction which is certainly infinitesimal.</p>
                        <p>3. Air Action</p>
                        <p>A. Overflights. Despite the Soviet protest and the probable <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> action on US overflights of Laos, I
                            think Souvanna will hold the line and <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0604"/>permit these to continue. The one exception to this
                            would be B–52 overflights. For some reason which is hard to define
                            (perhaps the nuclear capability) overflights by B–52's carry much more
                            propaganda wallop than overflights by fighter bombers. The political and
                            propaganda repercussions of such overflights are in my judgment far
                            greater than the limited marginal operational gain. In short, the 20
                            minutes to an hour which we would save by overflying Laos rather than
                            going south of Cambodia are just not worth the consequences. Therefore,
                            I believe we should hold the line in running our B–52's from Utapao
                            south of Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>The B–52's which come from Guam will continue to execute the bulk of the
                            raids in Laos in any event. I am not convinced that there is such a
                            crying need for flexibility that we must change this pattern.
                            Consequently, we must avoid public acknowledgment of B–52 activity in
                            Laos and we must guarantee no slippage by preventing B–52 overflights
                            from Utapao.</p>
                        <p>B. Air Seeding. As I indicated above, air seeding can be done provided we
                            characterize it as a continuing part of our interdiction campaign and
                            don't label it a barrier. As a matter of fact we have already done some
                            air seeding in Laos and I have Souvanna's concurrence in it. Therefore,
                            if we handle this one correctly it presents no problems. If we get the
                            issues all tangled up with barriers it could cause many great
                            difficulties in attempting to obtain Souvanna's concurrence.</p>
                        <p>C. <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77. Air Forces wishes to install
                                <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 at site 85. I am having
                            further discussions with Air Force Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> and Chief of Staff McConnell today. In general, I
                            think Souvanna would reject this if it were put to him honestly. He has
                            agreed to the installation of the navigational devices in Laos and we
                            have installed <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss>s on Lao soil.
                            However, the <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> is a passive
                            device. The <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 is a command radar
                            which takes positive control of air strikes in North Vietnamese
                            territory. Moreover, it involves several buildings and about 40 men. It
                            would be very conspicuous. I wonder if it is worth it.</p>
                        <p>4. Political Consequences</p>
                        <p>If we decide to ignore Souvanna's objections and go ahead with some of
                            these proposals despite him, we would have serious consequences. At the
                            very least, these consequences would involve the withdrawal of
                            Souvanna's collaboration on many other matters of importance to us,
                            including ground actions within Laos which are designed to protect the
                            Mekong Valley area. At the very worst, he could chuck in his job, retire
                            to France and let the country degenerate into a Pathet Lao occupied,
                            Communist controlled fief. If he retired, the Soviets would predictably
                            support the Pathet Lao. The North Vietnamese would directly attack
                            toward the Mekong and we would lose all the territorial gains we have
                            made in the past three years. Therefore, for limited operational
                            advantages on the Ho Chi Minh Trail (none of which I am convinced <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0605"/>would succeed) we would
                            probably lose the entire Mekong Valley. To quote President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName>, this would be really trading
                            an apple for an orchard.</p>

                        <p>In a May 1, 1967, memorandum to Under Secretary of State Katzenbach,

                                Bundy</persName> set down the “line of thought” that he expressed to
                            Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> on
                            April 29 concerning strategy in Vietnam. Included in that memorandum as
                            a “Factor Affecting Possible Changes in Our Military Action” was the
                            following information on Laos:</p>
                        <p>“Last Friday [April 28] we went through General Starbird's plans for more
                            effective action against the Corridor in Laos. I think these make sense,
                            although they cannot be expected to do more than make use of the
                            Corridor somewhat more difficult. (We should at once get away from
                            linking these with the true 'Obstacle' planned in the eastern area of
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> next to the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>. The two are entirely different, and
                            the words 'obstacle' or 'barrier' as related to Laos have very
                            unfortunate political implications in both Laos and Thailand.) The small
                            ground force team Starbird needs in Laos can be handled, in <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s judgment.</p>
                        <p>“Beyond this point, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and I
                            would both be strongly opposed to any such idea as sending a <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> division into Laos. It would almost
                            certainly be ineffective, and the cry would at once go up to send more.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> believes, and I
                            agree, that Souvanna would object violently and feel that his whole
                            position had been seriously compromised.” (Department of State,
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> Files: Lot 85 D 240, WPB Chron, May

                        <p>The Department of Defense was working on the concept of a barrier, and
                            anti-infiltration system involving strong points and obstacles on the
                            ground immediately south of the Demilitarized Zone between North and
                            South Vietnam in the northeastern part of Quang Tri Province. Air
                            interdiction would form part of the barrier. According to Department of
                            Defense planning, such interdiction would extend into eastern Laos
                            across the panhandle. In addition, the Department of Defense raised
                            again the idea of construction of an international highway, Route 9,
                            across Laos into Thailand as part the anti-infiltration system. (Letter
                            from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Steadman to <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, I–35288/67, March 23; ibid.,

                        <p>In an April 21 letter to Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SRC1">Richard Steadman</persName>, Deputy Assistant
                            Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> stated
                            that reconstruction <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0606"/>of Route 9
                            across the Lao Panhandle, as an adjunct to the Strong Point-Obstacle
                            System, was impractical and not desirable. Construction workers would
                            have to be preceded by substantial military forces to retake territory
                            held by the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese troops. Forces would have to
                            remain to provide security. The introduction of U.S. military personnel
                            into Laos would not be politically acceptable, nor would the Souvanna
                            government agree to such a proposal because of its often expressed
                            opposition to steps that would widen the war in Laos and lead to direct
                            military confrontation on Lao soil. (Ibid.)</p>

                        <p>191165. Eyes only for the Ambassador from the Secretary. Please pass the
                            following message to the Foreign Minister:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>: I have given
                            considerable thought to the oral demarche on Laos which Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> on April 12.<note n="2" xml:id="d285fn2">See <ref target="#d280">Document
                                280</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>We do not, of course, accept the charges outlined in that demarche. To
                            the extent that the sovereignty, integrity and stability of Laos have
                            been impaired since the Geneva Agreements of 1962, these unfortunate and
                            dangerous developments are a direct result of North Vietnamese refusal
                            to accept the essential provisions of those Agreements. On more than one
                            occasion we have called to the attention of representatives of the
                            Soviet Union the refusal of North Viet-Nam to withdraw its military
                            forces from Laos, to cease the intimidation of Laos and infiltration of
                            men and arms into South Viet-Nam, the obstruction of the proper
                            functioning of the coalition government of Laos in Pathet Lao held areas
                            and the refusal of Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese elements to permit
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> to function freely throughout
                            the country. However, we do not believe that it serves a useful purpose
                            merely to exchange charges about what has happened in the past. We
                            believe that the Soviet Union and the United <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0607"/>States have special responsibilities to Laos because of
                            the circumstances in which the Geneva Accords of 1962 came into being.
                            We believe, therefore, it would be more useful, in the light of our
                            grave joint responsibilities for peace, to turn our common attention to
                            the question of vindicating and enforcing those important agreements,
                            and to do so as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p>My government has always supported and continues to support what the
                            Bucharest statement of July 7, 1966, calls 'the strict observance' of
                            the 1962 Geneva Agreements.<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">For text of the
                                statement issued by the Political Consultative Committee of the

                                Current Documents, 1966, pp. 832–834.</note> We believe that it is a
                            matter of urgency to take whatever steps are necessary to restore and
                            reaffirm them. Various suggestions have been made since 1964 about how
                            to set such a process in motion. Action to this end might be initiated
                            by the Co-Chairmen. The Laos Conference could be reconvened. The <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> could be strengthened and asked to take
                            more active responsibilities. Or we could undertake other steps in the
                            spirit of the <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName>-Pushkin
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>My government would welcome any opportunity, in any forum, to restore
                            peace and stability to Laos. In particular, we would support the
                            reconvening of the Laos Conference of 1962 in order to make the Laos
                            Agreements an effective instrument of peace.</p>
                        <p>If other ways seem more promising to you, my government will give them
                            serious consideration.</p>
                        <p>I will be pleased to discuss the question of Laos and related matters
                            with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> when he
                            returns to Washington. Alternatively, if you prefer that these matters
                            be discussed with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TLE1">Thompson</persName>, we would be entirely agreeable. If you prefer

                        <p>1. Ref message proposed a two-phase extension of the <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> concept. Phase I involves the
                            employment of a reinforced <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            battalion, Airborne or Ranger, to exploit intelligence gained by Prairie
                            Fire assets. Phase II visualizes employment of an <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> division-size task force in sustained
                            operations against enemy bases in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. As ref message points out, Prairie Fire forces are now encountering
                            well-armed and well-trained company or larger sized <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> troops who are willing to fight to
                            protect their supply bases and keep their <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s open. This is to be expected when considering that
                            Prairie Fire forces of up to three platoons conducted continuous
                            operations in the <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> III area for
                            almost six weeks. The results of Prairie Fire operations in <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> III are impressive.</p>
                        <p>3. You propose the use of regular <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>
                            forces up to division size. A commitment of large <gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> ground forces into Laos will almost
                            certainly be opposed by a large commitment of North Vietnamese ground
                            forces to protect their valuable base areas. Thus, a chain of
                            requirements could be initiated of almost open-ended proportions,
                            including the commitment of sizeable US ground forces to assist the
                            beleaguered <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. The commitment of regular <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> troops
                            into Laos could not be done covertly. Indeed, it is improbable that the
                            plan could be kept secret once <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> is
                            consulted. Thus, there would be an overt violation of the Geneva Accords
                            which would put <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>
                            and his government in jeopardy. Consider it far preferable to maintain
                            our ground posture in Laos by the use of non-regular, deniable ground
                            forces. Serious consideration of the political complications is required
                            before initiating overt operations which would move the battleground
                            into Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. Our operations in Laos should be oriented primarily toward maximizing
                            destruction of enemy facilities, base areas, <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>s, and, where feasible, his forces at minimum cost to
                            US. Air power, both tactical and Arc Light, can do this for us when the
                            necessary pin-point intelligence can be made available. Prairie Fire
                            operations do this effectively <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0609"/>and at low risk and cost. While in full agreement with the need for
                            increased pressure against the enemy in Laos, it would appear more
                            logical to substantially increase the numbers of Spike Teams and Hornet
                            Force operations, thereby acquiring the necessary intelligence for
                            bringing air power more fully to bear. Use of recon/intelligence Spike
                            Teams is limited only by numbers of teams available and helicopter
                            support. It is now permissible to use up to three Hornet Force platoons
                            in one operation at any given time. There is no restriction on numbers
                            of operations. Efforts to bring the three Prairie Fire battalions, now
                            authorized, to full strength should be accelerated to the extent
                            practicable.</p>
                        <p>6. Increasing Prairie Fire operations to pin-point enemy targets and then
                            destroying such targets by the use of air power, appears to provide the
                            most practical, as well as the most politically acceptable, means to
                            increase pressures on the enemy at least cost and risk to our primary

                            year or so. In addition, to estimate the reactions of <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> and the effect on his

                            reactions of other foreign governments to these courses of action are
                            not considered.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. During the past several years, the Kingdom of Laos has achieved a
                            substantial degree of political stability. This rests, in part, on the
                            international <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0610"/>support which the
                            Royal Lao Government has enjoyed since the 1962 Geneva settlement,
                            support which Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> earnestly seeks to retain. More important, it
                            rests on an understanding among Souvanna, the military, and—to a lesser
                            degree—the conservatives and neutralists, which aims at preserving Lao
                            independence and the attributes of neutrality and tripartitism. In the
                            short term, at least, we see no serious diminution of military support
                            for the regime, nor does a military-inspired coup attempt seem
                            likely.</p>
                        <p>B. We believe that Souvanna, if approached officially, would disapprove
                            any proposal put to him involving Allied ground action in the Laos
                                Panhandle.<note n="2" xml:id="d287fn2">Mr. George C. Denney, for the
                                Director of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, believes
                                that Souvanna almost certainly would resign. Souvanna regards the
                                preservation of the Geneva settlement as indispensable to the
                                survival of Laos and would see the visible introduction of allied
                                ground forces as signaling the abandonment of that settlement. He
                                has made these points many times. If, despite his opposition, the
                                actions contemplated in this sentence were undertaken, he would
                                assume, against the background of previous US assurances to him,
                                that the US had broken the relationship of confidence built up since
                                1962 and had lost interest in preserving the Geneva settlement and
                                in his remaining in office. He would have no hope, therefore, that
                                by remaining in office he could exercise any further influence on
                                our courses of action. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> [<hi rend="italic">11 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>

                                system (later known as Illinois City and then Dye Marker). Souvanna
                                knew about and was receptive to the idea. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> also reported that he did

                                forces' role in Practice Nine. (Johnson Library, National Security

                        </p>
                        <p>1. The reference was read with mixed emotions. The fact that <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has accepted readily
                            the idea of an anti-infiltration system <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0611"/>in Laos is extremely gratifying. Moreover, the manner
                            in which his approval was given, as described in the reference, leads me
                            to believe that Souvanna would be amenable to further excursions on the
                            part of the U.S. to operate in Laos against the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s statement
                            that he does not intend to approach Souvanna on the subject of Prairie
                            Fire operating in connection with the air supported anti-infiltration
                            system is disappointing to me. I have always considered Prairie Fire
                            support of Practice Nine absolutely necessary if the program is to
                            succeed, and recommend that Souvanna be informed of the use of ground
                            teams in the area as soon as possible. Additionally, I believe that
                            Phase III of Prairie Fire should be surfaced with Souvanna at this time
                            and presented as a necessary adjunct to the anti-infiltration system,
                            and as a logical extension of present Prairie Fire operations.</p>
                        <p>3. [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>] He
                            refers to this as a “contingency plan” whereas it is an elemental facet
                            of Practice Nine. During a period of five months of the year, November
                            thru March, the launching of Prairie Fire teams into the Practice Nine
                            area from RVN will be severely limited due to the influence of the
                            northeast monsoons. The use of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] during that period is essential
                            if the anti-infiltration system is to be supported adequately by Prairie
                            Fire operations.</p>
                        <p>4. Even though no single program is the panacea to the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> infiltration problem, the combination
                            of the Practice Nine program in Laos, Phase III Prairie Fire, and
                            programmed increases in current Prairie Fire operations would seriously
                            degrade the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> capability to move
                            troops and supplies through Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. I believe that an excellent opportunity still exists to present the
                            entire program to Souvanna if it is tied properly to his current
                            interest. I strongly recommend that actions be taken by SecState to
                            implement this approach as soon as possible.</p>

                                reviewing operational proposals for Commando Lava. The Department
                                asked if this was a project for which Souvanna should be consulted,
                                suggesting that from a political and psychological point of view
                                consultation would seem important. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, POL 27 LAOS) The Embassy responded in telegram 7481, June 2,
                                that as the operation was purely experimental, Souvanna had not been
                                consulted, but if it was executed in military application, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> would consult with the Lao
                                Prime Minister. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Essentially, operation involved air-dropping common chemicals on two
                            interdiction points along Route 96 and Route 110. Rain falling on these
                            chemicals results in chelation and dispersion of soil, in such measure
                            that mud loses all consistency and becomes incapable of supporting
                            vehicles or any other substantial weight. This not only vastly enhances
                            nature's own mud making in quality, but also extends the effect of the
                            rainy season because of the chemicals' persistency.</p>
                        <p>3. We believe this could prove a far more effective road interdiction
                            device (at least in rainy season) than iron bombs and infinitely less
                            costly. Chemicals are commercially available, paper sacked, and air
                            dropped from cargo type aircraft. We would hope that, in proper
                            application, we could close all the main routes into Laos for vehicle
                            traffic during the rainy season, and, perhaps extend that effect for a
                            month or so beyond the normal scope of that season. We also believe
                            program has considerable application in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. Moreover, I have asked that another experiment be carried out
                            concerning hand application of these chemicals to defense perimeters
                            where soil is also protected by vegetable roots and matting. If this is
                            successful, <pb n="581" xml:id="pg_581" facs="0613"/>we may be able to
                            develop some use for this technique in an anti-personnel sense as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has
                            expressed considerable interest in following up this program. Therefore,
                            our control team, which consists of three representatives from <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Headquarters, will visit Saigon later
                            this week, then <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and then
                            back to the putty-knife factory at Langley.</p>
                        <p>6. I believe this program demands immediate, high level attention in
                            Washington. I would hope that both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and Joint Chiefs will have
                            opportunity to be briefed. I would like to make mud on several routes in
                            Laos, starting from 19 in north, through 6, 7, and 4, plus the entire Ho
                            Chi Minh and Sihanouk Trail structures. If the drop aircraft are
                            available and if the chemicals can be shipped, I feel that we can close
                            more routes more effectively, and at a minute fraction of the current
                            cost, than we can with our bombing efforts.</p>
                        <p>7. I also feel that, if we could combine these techniques with techniques
                            of Operation Popeye, perhaps within concept of Practice Nine, we might
                            be able to make enemy movement among the cordillera of the Annamite
                            chain almost prohibitive. In short, chelation may prove better than
                            escalation. Make mud, not war!</p>

                        <p>2. Unless you perceive new factors not previously taken into account, I
                            would like you to discuss this matter with Souvanna at earliest time you
                            judge opportune. To minimize possibility of damage to our essential
                            relationship with him, you should present proposal as an idea we are
                            considering—with view to obtaining his acquiescence but short of making
                            direct request for authority. You should note that basic function of
                            this installation—like others on <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>
                            mainland—would be precise navigational control of aircraft; that <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 is a quantum jump beyond <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> facilities already emplaced within
                            Laos; and that <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> has necessary
                            equipment and personnel for immediate installation. Such a facility may
                            have appeal to Souvanna with respect to US operations in Laos (though we
                            are aware that you believe tactical changes would in fact be minimal at
                            least initially). You will, of course, have to acknowledge capability of
                            system to direct air strikes against North Vietnam. In other words, you
                            should avoid both exclusive concentration on offensive use against North
                            Vietnam of ground installation in Laos and dissimulation that would
                            jeopardize our relationship of candor and trust in event we decide to
                            approve emplacement and installation should ultimately be exposed.<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">In telegram 7712 from Vientiane, June 14,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> reported he had
                                discussed hypothetically the question of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 with Souvanna the morning of June 14. Souvanna's
                                reaction was “cautious, but generally positive.” If the unit were to
                                be installed, Souvanna suggested that it must be done without his
                                knowledge. Technicians servicing the site would have to be civilians
                                or military personnel with civilian documentation. The site would
                                need to be camouflaged both physically and electronically, and would
                                need demolition units attached for emergency use. (Ibid., DEF 15

                        <p>7638. 1. After some delay, the rainy season has begun in earnest
                            throughout Laos. Heavy rain has been falling for the past two weeks in
                            the Panhandle. During last several days, downpour so heavy in northern
                            Laos as to make flying almost impossible. Mekong River Valley, which had
                            already received nearly two feet of rainfall by this time last year, has
                            received several inches in past few days and rice cultivation cycle has
                            begun.</p>
                        <p>2. Result of this seasonal change, as in the past, has been dramatic
                            reduction in level military activity throughout country. Major
                            difference between this year and previous years is that Lao Government
                            and friendly guerrillas hold considerable territorial advantage, which
                            they feel fully confident to preserve. In fact, they have previously
                            used rainy season to regain dry season losses. This rainy season they
                            may be able convert that sort of forward activity into positive
                            territorial gains.</p>
                        <p>3. On Ho Chi Minh and Sihanouk Trails, vehicle traffic has ground
                            virtually to a halt. There continues to be some shuttle movement on
                            firm, high stretches of road structure, but lowland reaches have become
                            impassable. Our road watch teams report that in many stretches of both
                            structures, ground has already reached saturation point and standing
                            water has covered roads. With good luck, this condition will prevail
                            from now until late October. It will mean that truck traffic on full
                            length of trails will be impossible during these several months and that
                            major use of these logistics arteries will be ruled out.</p>
                        <p>4. This does not mean that enemy use of Lao territory for logistics
                            purpose will cease altogether during the rains. Waterways, bicycle
                            trails, and human porters will still be used. We will shift our road
                            watch teams and our tactics to take this into account. However, it does
                            mean that, by and large, those enemy units in South Vietnam which depend
                            on these two logistics routes must live on supplies already in place or
                            in cache for the months ahead. It certainly means that they could not
                            call up major emergency logistics over these two structures during the
                            period ahead.</p>
                        <p>5. We do not intend to relax our road watch and other vigilance in the
                            Panhandle, or elsewhere in Laos, during the rains. Instead, we intend to
                            use this time to extend and improve communications, to work out better
                            liaison and response arrangements with 7th AF, etc. but we will be <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0616"/>surprised if we encounter much
                            enemy activity in most regions and will report and evaluate what we
                            see.</p>
                        <p>6. We will, of course, be acutely interested in any reflections, either
                            political or military, which addresses may detect to bear out inevitable
                            enemy acceptance of the fact that the monsoon has made its annual
                            mark.</p>

                        <p>2. Reference a recommended approval of a <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> concept to initiate a guerrilla warfare program
                            in southeastern Laos. This program would exploit certain highland tribal
                            groups who inhabit the area and are currently being exploited by the
                            enemy to support infiltration activities. The concept is visualized as a
                            supplement to ongoing Prairie Fire reconnaissance and interdiction
                            operations and would be stated within the existing Prairie Fire zone
                            with tribes who live astride the RVN/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            border. If and when successful development of the guerrillas indicated,
                            expansion beyond the existing Prairie Fire zone would be desirable in
                            specific areas. Such expansion would, of course, be coordinated with any
                            ongoing <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operations.</p>
                        <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0617"/>
                        <p>3. Reference b raised certain objections of the Central Intelligence
                            Agency to the concept. First, the capability to develop an effective
                            guerrilla force is questioned; and second, a conflict between Prairie
                            Fire and CAS operations is feared should the program expand.</p>
                        <p>4. The southeastern Panhandle of Laos is an immense, heavily jungled
                            area, where the enemy has shown great skill and ingenuity in keeping his
                            routes open and his bases secure. Although air operations, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, and Prairie Fire have all increased in
                            capability and enjoyed increasing success, they have only reduced
                            slightly the flow of enemy troops and material. Proportionate to the
                            area and the size of the enemy forces deployed therein even the expanded
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and Prairie Fire programs would
                            be very modest in scope. The guerrilla concept is simply one more way to
                            reduce the enemy's security in the Panhandle and to force him to divert
                            more effort to protect his supply lines and base areas. <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> has already made sufficient
                            contacts with tribal groups living astride the RVN/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> border to be confident that a real
                            potential does exist, particularly with the Bru and Sedang tribes.</p>
                        <p>5. There is no intent on the part of <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>
                            to enter into conflict or competition with any <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> program. On the contrary, these programs are seen as
                            being complementary. Initially, recruiting and development activity
                            would be restricted to the Prairie Fire area. Only when and if the
                            potential developed and the situation indicated, would a guerrilla
                            warfare area be designated beyond that limit; and then such an area
                            would be coordinated with <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> to ensure
                            the most effective use of assets and over-all program. There is no
                            intention to simply move the Prairie Fire line west to the Se
                            Kong-Tchepone line.</p>
                        <p>6. Discussions between <gloss target="#t_SACSA1">SACSA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> representatives indicate that the
                            reservations expressed in Mr. Helm's letter may have stemmed from a
                            misunderstanding of the proposal, and that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> would not, in fact, object to the program within the
                            present Prairie Fire area.<note n="4" xml:id="d292fn4">In a June 28

                                    <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> indicated that
                                after reading this memorandum the Agency view of the Joint Chief's
                                proposal “remains essentially as outlined to you in my letter of May
                                19. We do not see significant difficulties for existing Agency
                                operational programs in the Laos Panhandle so long as the guerrilla
                                force is deployed within the current Prairie Fire area.” <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> did suggest that the proposal
                                raised “several political questions,” but noted that these were
                                matters for the Department of State. (Washington National Records
                                Center, RG 330, OASD/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> Files: FRC
                                71 A 4919, Laos 000.1—(381 Laos), 1967)</note> However, they would
                            rather defer any discussion of expansion beyond those limits until such
                            a time as a guerrilla potential has actually been developed and a
                            specific proposal can be made. This position is not incompatible with
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal, which recommends
                            initial efforts limited to the present Prairie Fire area with later
                            expansion as indicated by the situation that develops.</p>

                            problem of coordinating an expanded area will be reopened if and when it

                        <p>The Secretary wondered if there were any possibility of solving the
                            situation in Laos. We thought it could be solved in 8 hours. Did Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> see any way to
                            proceed?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the
                            broadening of U.S. interference in Laos is the problem. U.S. aviation
                            and U.S. military activities had increased. He was sorry about the U.S.
                            behavior in Laos, which weakened Soviet arguments for maintaining the
                            Laos agreements. The U.S. knows that the Soviet Union is not in Laos and
                            is not active there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Soviet Union was prepared to go to 1000%
                            agreement of all parties in Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0619"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> asked if the U.S. was
                            ready to do so tonight, to which the Secretary replied affirmatively.
                            But, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said, the U.S.
                            is in Laos tonight.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that 6,000 North Vietnamese troops had been left
                            behind in Northern Laos after the agreement had been signed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said this was
                            one-sided information which he could not accept as factual. However, it
                            was a fact that the U.S. was in Laos. How could the U.S. say it was not
                            interfering?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it should be understood that if a North Vietnamese
                            division moves into Laos, we will bomb it. We don't want to do so, but
                            this is what will happen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that if the U.S.
                            was not in Laos it could talk of no interference with the observance of
                            the agreement. But the U.S. is in Laos. There is not one Soviet soldier
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that North Vietnamese troops are there. If we got out,
                            would they get out? He suggested that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> should use its influence, as co-Chairman, to bring
                            about the departure of the North Vietnamese troops.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the U.S. was
                            not a good example for others. At one time, the U.S. was not in Laos
                            openly. We had military personnel there but they were in civilian
                            clothes. Now the U.S. military operates openly. The U.S. is present, and
                            this weakens the Soviet position as co-Chairman, and makes it difficult
                            to use its influence positively.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                            join with the other co-Chairman to get all of the parties out of
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought it would be
                            better for the Control Commission to take such responsibility. There are
                            three groups in Laos. They should coordinate their actions better than
                            they do. This difficulty is probably a result of U.S. influence on
                            certain factions. If the U.S. used its influence correctly, there could

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said they had a
                            different interpretation. He continued that the U.S. position on Laos is
                            weak—weaker than before. The U.S. is not only present, but it is present
                            in a new way.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought about the North Vietnamese presence, but
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said the problem was
                            the United States presence.</p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0620"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had an agreement with the Soviet Union in
                            1962, but the North Vietnamese didn't recognize it for a moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> thought there should
                            be a discussion between the three groups in Laos. He thought the U.S.
                            had more influence with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> than the Soviets. It probably was the U.S. which
                            complicated efforts at coordination among the three groups. If one
                            compared the U.S. position in Laos with that of the Soviets, the U.S.
                            position was worse.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this was not the point. The North Vietnamese are there
                            and that is against the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, in something of a non
                            sequitur, said that the killing of a well-known leader of one of the
                            political factions—Foreign Minister Pholsena<note n="3" xml:id="d293fn3">Minister Quinim Pholsena was assassinated on April 1,
                            1963.</note>—had complicated the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the circumstances of this were unclear. Some said
                            Pholsena had been involved in the assassination of other figures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> reacted strongly,
                            saying there was not a grain of truth in this story. Had there been an
                            investigation? Pholsena had been a neutralist, a <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> man. In any event, the
                            Soviets were sorry that the situation in Laos had become worse. They had
                            wanted agreement. He did not exclude that the Soviets would revert to
                            the Laos problem again.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why we could not all act to support the original
                            agreement in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> said that the Soviets
                            would be prepared to consider realistic problems without prejudice, but
                            that we should not complicate the situation with false stories. (The
                            latter was apparently in reference to the discussion about
                            Pholsena.)</p>

                        <p>Part One: For Vientiane</p>
                        <p>1. We are pleased that Souvanna reflects a generally positive attitude
                            about <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 installation in Laos. His
                            concerns are fully understood and, except with respect to location,
                            those mentioned in Ref. B can be allayed:</p>
                        <p>a. Souvanna's position that he would wish to be able to deny knowledge of
                            installation is understandable. If facility were to be exposed, we would
                            propose to acknowledge presence of navigational aid in area where such
                            facility woefully deficient. In such circumstance, is it likely that
                            Souvanna would be willing to acknowledge in general that US has provided
                            navigational aids to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, so that
                            question in fact directed toward <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77
                            might be dealt with by allusion to TACANS which we understand Souvanna
                            has approved for use in Laos? We hope in any event that Souvanna would
                            hold in abeyance any comment on “violation” until nature of disclosure
                            precisely known and could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel will operate facility,
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>c. Equipment would be prepared for emergency destruction at time of
                            installation. In event of communist attack, we will wish to count on
                                <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> for vigorous defense
                            long enough to evacuate personnel but not, if pressure heavy, for
                            defense of equipment.</p>
                        <p>d. Previous communications should provide basis for assurances that every
                            feasible measure will be taken for physical and electronic
                            camouflage.</p>
                        <p>2. Taking into account technical requirements (primarily line-of- sight
                            feature and range of system) and security and low visibility
                            requirements, it remains Washington judgment that Site 85 is not only
                            best but only feasible location. We have understood your analysis
                            supported this judgment. Unless you have alternate proposal we could
                            quickly review, believe justification for this selection must stand.</p>
                        <pb n="590" xml:id="pg_590" facs="0622"/>
                        <p>3. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> has determined
                            that military requirement justifies accepting potential political
                            liabilities and we are hopeful Souvanna will understand basis on which
                            this difficult decision made. In light contradiction (Ref B) between
                            Souvanna's desire for reassurances on specific points and his wish not
                            to know what we are doing, will have to leave to your judgment how best
                            to bring him to awareness that we have taken his concerns (which we
                            share) fully into account in reaching decision to proceed. Advise action
                            taken to square your account with him.</p>

                            personnel from other positive programs underway or approved, and that if
                            it were fully implemented it would come into conflict with other
                            projects in Laos and raise to an unacceptable level the risk of exposing
                            US ground operations there.</p>
                        <p>a. <hi rend="italic">Manpower</hi>: We understand that US Special Forces
                            personnel available for the Pacific Theater remain in seriously short
                            supply. We do not understand, particularly in the light of other
                            drawbacks, a recommendation to allocate up to a total of 10 <gloss target="#t_USSF1">USSF</gloss> A Detachments and support personnel
                            to this program when authorized Prairie Fire operations are already
                            inhibited by shortage of personnel and when prospective requirements in
                            connection with Illinois City remain unfilled.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, indigenous personnel are lacking to meet approved Prairie Fire
                            quotas and operational needs. The shortage looms so acutely, as planning
                            for Illinois City progresses, that <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> is still pressing for use of Thai units, despite
                            the judgment of both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>, which we share, that use of US-Thai teams will
                            not be acceptable under the conditions contemplated.</p>
                        <p>It would not seem prudent to dilute programs already approved for the
                            sake of a new variation unless there were exciting prospects of success.
                            We do not believe this is the case. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            has had several years experience with Kha tribal groups analogous to
                            those envisaged for the <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0624"/>guerrilla force. Prolonged and careful training has resulted in
                            creation of the passive road-watch teams which are increasingly
                            effective in monitoring the flow of supplies through the Laos Panhandle.

                        <p>b. <hi rend="italic">Anti-Infiltration Tactics</hi>: The plan to raise
                            guerrilla forces is in harmony with past military proposals for Prairie
                            Fire—that is, of seeking approval for progressively larger units as well
                            as more numerous operations to greater depths. It is one step further in
                            the direction of commitment of both US and Vietnamese combat ground
                            forces, which we know informally Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has at least been contemplating. Given the
                            extent and difficulty of terrain and the political problems of Laos, we
                            cling to the belief that the optimal way to cope with infiltration
                            through the Panhandle is to detect and monitor movement of men and
                            supplies by quiet surveillance and to seek to deter it through
                            controlled use of air power rather than with battalions. We recently
                            suggested that Defense consider breaking up the already constituted
                            larger Prairie Fire units to form more of the small reconnaissance
                            teams, thus far without receiving comment. This is an alternative we
                            consider worth pursuing.</p>
                        <p>c. <hi rend="italic">Extent of Operations</hi>: Gen. <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>'s memorandum of 17 June says
                            that operations can be initiated within the presently authorized Prairie
                            Fire area and that “the problem of coordinating an expanded area will be
                            reopened if and when it arises”. We believe this issue should be faced
                            now. The approved <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> study
                            (JCSM–215–67) says that although initial steps (recruitment, training,
                            etc.) can be undertaken within the Prairie Fire area and without
                            additional US commitment inside Laos, “this initial activity should not
                            be undertaken without conceptual approval of the over-all program”. The
                            over-all program envisages more than doubling the present depth of the
                            Prairie Fire zone. The greater the depth, the greater the dependence on
                            vulnerable (US) helicopter lift and escort and, in general, the greater
                            the risk of exposure of operations which Lao Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has not approved and
                            has declared in advance he could not approve. Such an extension would
                            also create difficult problems of coordination with the successful
                                <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> road-watch operation and would
                            probably revive earlier <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> objections
                            to the proposal (which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName>
                            has withdrawn “so long as the guerrilla force is deployed within the
                            current Prairie Fire area”).</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has recorded
                            the judgment that the Prairie Fire area cannot be further extended nor
                            larger units introduced without crossing the threshold from covert to
                            overt operations to which Souvanna would be obliged to react. He has
                            recently reaffirmed these views and the belief that it is unrealistic
                            even to consider extension of the zone—with attendant risks—when our
                            resources do not permit more than nibbling at opportunities for
                            application of the <gloss target="#t_SLAM1">SLAM</gloss> concept of
                            concentrated ground-air interdiction within the established Prairie Fire
                                <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0625"/>zone. He would specifically
                            oppose use of Special Forces A Detachments—without which the Kha
                            guerrilla units would be unlikely to function effectively—in Laos.</p>
                        <p>d. <hi rend="italic"> Lao Involvement</hi>: The concept envisages
                            preliminary discussions between South Vietnamese and Lao military
                            authorities (<gloss target="#t_RVNAF1">RVNAF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FA1">FA</gloss>) to obtain Lao agreement to the program
                            and the services of selected Lao personnel to make initial contacts,
                            with US involvement and control kept in the background at this stage. An
                            apparently similar proposal has in fact already been discussed during
                            the recent visit of Lao General <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and others to Saigon, on which we
                            unfortunately lack detailed reporting. The Lao interest, however, is
                            known to be limited to obtaining Vietnamese logistic, training and
                            probably financial support for the development of guerrilla units that
                            would operate under Lao, not Vietnamese or US, control. To the extent
                            this can be done without direct US financing or other involvement, we
                            would have no objection. We may, in fact, derive from Lao and Vietnamese
                            pursuit of the idea some further insights into the possibilities of
                            developing guerrilla formations in this remote area.</p>

                                85, the United States would accept Souvanna's denial of prior
                                knowledge and in turn remain silent or say “no comment.”
                                (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Souvanna agreed this morning to installation of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 at Site 85. I assured him that:</p>
                        <p>a) All <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> markings would be removed
                            from equipment,</p>
                        <p>b) Detonators would be affixed to permit immediate destruction in case of
                            imminent danger,</p>
                        <p>c) Personnel would be under civilian cover,</p>
                        <p>d) Maximum measures would be taken to camouflage against detection from
                            the air, and</p>
                        <p>e) Electronic camouflage would be undertaken by scrambled transmission to
                            relay aircraft over Gulf of Tonkin.</p>
                        <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>2. In turn, Souvanna accepted agreed formulation on public relations
                            posture. If there are deniable allegations concerning presence of this
                            installation, he will say “I have no knowledge of such facility in
                            Laos”. If it is blown in undeniable fashion, he will say “I did not know
                            it was there”. In both instances, U.S. can either remain silent or say
                            “no comment.” This should bring all of us angels together on the head of
                            the same pin.</p>
                        <p>3. Souvanna also asked whether this radar could function to detect
                            violations of Lao air space. There have been contributing reports of
                            unidentified aircraft in vicinity Plain des Jarres. (Just last evening,
                            we made an abortive effort to intercept a reported Ilyushin 18 near
                            Moung Kheung.) He says he fears these are ChiCom planes used to provide
                            liaison with ChiCom Mission at Kheng Khay. I told him I thought this
                            could probably be worked into installation, but it might degrade our
                            communications security.</p>
                        <p>4. Please provide technically sound reply whether <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 could serve as early warning radar, or, in a pinch,
                            as intercept control.<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">In telegram 3371 to

                                little or no use in detecting violations of Lao airspace.”
                                (Ibid.)</note> If so, would this cause shift from agreed line of
                            sight, scrambled, and relayed emanation pattern.</p>
                        <p>5. Assume <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will now direct 7th AF to
                            make contact with my Air Attaché to get this project moving. Timing and
                            other factors involving sensitivity will be coordinated by this
                            Embassy.</p>
                        <p>6. I would like assurances that info on this installation will be held on
                            the closest need-to-know basis, that all personnel who do know will be
                            briefed on need for maximum security and that all efforts will be made
                            to avoid indications of its location on maps, charts, or instructions.
                            If operational strike units can function without actually knowing exact
                            location of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77, this would clearly
                            obviate possibility that captured air crews could become source of

                        <p>a. Phase III, Prairie Fire: An expansion of our existing covert
                            operations to provide for organizing a 3,000 man indigenous guerrilla
                            force to operate under US leadership against the enemy <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> in the Southeastern part of the Laos
                            Panhandle.</p>
                        <p>b. Southpaw. Airmobile raids of 3–7 days duration employing South
                            Vietnamese regular forces up to brigade size against known enemy base
                            areas contiguous to the RVN border.</p>
                        <p>2. Phase III, Prairie Fire: The plan is to recruit, train, and control
                            indigenous Lao tribesmen within the present Prairie Fire Operational
                            Area, initially. Development of a friendly guerrilla force in the
                            mountains of the Eastern Laotian Panhandle is of critical importance to
                            the ultimate objective of Prairie Fire Operations, i.e., destruction of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> infiltration system and denial of the area to the enemy.
                            The area in question is completely under <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/Pathet Lao/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> control.
                            The Royal Laotian Government exercises no administrative control nor
                            does it maintain a presence in the area. The region is populated by
                            tribal groups collectively called Kha on the Laotian side of the
                            boundary, and Montagnards in South Vietnam. In the Prairie Fire area, it
                            is estimated the indigenous population could support a friendly force of
                            3,000 organized guerrillas. Such a force, coordinated with other Prairie
                            Fire operations and provided tactical air support already available,
                            could effectively reduce enemy control of the area. Following approval,
                            the guerrilla force will be developed nominally under the flag of the
                            Royal Laotian Government, thus contributing to the extension of Royal
                            Laotian control areas where it never existed before. Although the
                            estimated goal of 3,000 guerrillas <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0628"/>will take over a year to develop, it is envisioned that
                            a 1,200 man force would be ready to carry out operational missions in
                            nine months. Specifically, authorization is required to recruit, support
                            and control Lao citizens now residing in the proposed operating area.
                            Authorization is also required to permit employment of US leadership in
                            Laos on a sustained basis with the proposed guerrilla force.
                            Approximately 120 US Special Forces personnel will ultimately be
                            required in Laos for proper control and development of the guerrilla
                            force.</p>
                        <p>3. Southpaw: a. This plan provides for conducting ground or airmobile
                            operations across the Laos border by regular South Vietnamese units of
                            battalion or brigade strength against close in known enemy base areas.
                            The operations would pit Vietnamese against Vietnamese in areas
                            controlled by Communists for short duration missions of 3 to 7 days. No
                            publicity would be given the operation and appropriate precautions would
                            be based on current intelligence verified by Prairie Fire forces.
                            Targets will be in unpopulated areas not under Royal Lao control.
                            Prairie Fire forces will precede task force operations for validation of
                            targets and landing zones. Prairie Fire forces will operate in
                            conjunction with the <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units as
                            reconnaissance and/or maneuver elements. Preparatory air strikes by
                            tactical aircraft and/or B–52s will be employed as required. The task
                            force will execute blocking, search and destroy, or raid operations
                            against selected targets in the Prairie Fire operational area. Blocking
                            actions will entail occupation of defensible terrain astride known major
                            infiltration roads and trails in order to disrupt force reaction by NVN
                            forces. Search and destroy and raid operations will follow established
                            procedures. Command and control of ground operations will be exercised
                            from a provisional <gloss target="#t_CP1">CP</gloss> established at a
                            Forward Operating Base. The task force commander, intelligence and
                            operations staffs will consist of Vietnamese with US Army advisors
                            experienced in cross border operations. It is visualized that
                            approximately 25 US advisors would be required with a three
                            battalion-brigade force in addition to US personnel that normally
                            accompany the Prairie Fire elements which might be committed.</p>
                        <p>b. Preparatory to the raid operation and as a portion of the cover and
                            deception plan, a <gloss target="#t_CIDG1">CIDG</gloss> camp with a C
                            130 capable airfield will be established close to the border of <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and as close as possible to the planned
                            area of operations in Laos. Materiel necessary for support of the
                            operation will be stockpiled covertly at this camp. Once established,
                            this camp will serve as the launch base for the raid. Close support by
                            US or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> artillery units and
                            logistical support for the task force will be provided from this base.
                            The raid task force will depend in the main on tactical air for support
                            and protection.</p>
                        <p>4. It should be pointed out that while Southpaw and Prairie Fire III are
                            not mutually dependent, they are nevertheless mutually supporting. <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0629"/>Taken individually or together,
                            they will enhance the effectiveness of the Illinois City operations.</p>

                        <p>(1) B–52's based at U–TAPAO could strike any target in South Vietnam or
                            Laos and return in four hours or less. U–TAPAO based B–52's could strike
                            targets in <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> or Mu Gia Pass area and
                            return in less than three hours. Present route south of Cambodia
                            requires up to six hours.</p>
                        <p>(2) Requiring B–52 strikes in Laos from Guam based aircraft only during
                            the hours of darkness, places an undue restriction on the employment of
                            the force. We should have maximum freedom to schedule the strikes so
                            that we can take advantage of a divert situation for a target of
                            opportunity in South Vietnam. Thus, the scheduling of strikes should be
                            related to ground action in South Vietnam whenever possible. To limit
                            such flights to the hours of darkness is tactically unsound.</p>
                        <p>(3) For an 800 sortie per month rate, the desired basing is 30 aircraft
                            at U–TAPAO. To realize the best effectiveness from such basing, the
                            three to four hour flight time is crucial in order to get strikes into
                            the ground battle area when the ground commander wants them. Overflight
                            of Laos is essential for exploitation of U–TAPAO basing. No tankers are
                            required with this basing, thereby saving some 350 air refueling sorties
                            per month.</p>

                            Subject: Dry season wrap-up.</p>
                        <p>1. After a false start in early June, the rainy season made a tardy
                            beginning in July. Lao “patriotic” forces preferred to call an earlier
                            and <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0631"/>more traditional halt to
                            the dry season at a May 18 celebration in Sam Neua. Despite their
                            grossly exaggerated claim of having killed over 3500 “reactionary”
                            troops, shot down or damaged 183 planes, and liberated over 40,000
                            people, they were probably much more anxious to see the end of this than
                            previous dry seasons.</p>
                        <p>2. Unlike prior years when they made significant dry season gains, North
                            Vietnamese troops, abetted by the Lao People's “Liberation” Army, were
                            unable to seize and hold any major objective except Nong Khang in
                            northern Houa Phan Province. They additionally lost control over a
                            substantial area in the Sedone Valley that had been under Communist
                            jurisdiction for approximately a decade. Despite repeated attacks,
                            government troops were able to retain exposed sites like Nakhang in
                            Xieng Khouang and Nam Bac in Luang Prabang. A steady flow of refugees
                            from Communist zones testified to the difficulty of life in enemy
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>3. The government military stance was stronger because of increased
                            devastation from air strikes due to (a) improved intelligence from road
                            watch and reconnaissance teams; (b) better exploitation of; prisoners,
                            particularly North Vietnamese and <gloss target="#t_LPLA1">LPLA</gloss>
                            defectors of stature; (c) improved communications between ground
                            observers and strike aircraft that have shortened the time gap between
                            reporting and attacks on targets; and (d) night flying aircraft that
                            made their debut November 2 and have been hampering enemy truck
                            movements during darkness. Other factors include increasing North
                            Vietnamese involvement in South Vietnam which has brought no fewer but
                            much greener North Vietnamese troops to Laos; a lowering of enemy morale
                            because of food shortages, labor levies, and fear of air strikes;
                            increased cooperation, since Kong Ke's ouster on October 17, between
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and Neutralist troops, even to
                            the extent of conducting the joint operation around Lao Ngam in April
                            and May; and slightly improved morale of government troops due to
                            successful retention of the Nam Bac Valley and the military achievements
                            of the Lao Ngam operation.</p>
                        <p>4. Better government posture did not always match military success.
                            However, the army still largely thinks in terms of occupying territory
                            rather than winning people. While civil-military relations were good in
                            Vang Vieng, Nam Bac, and Lao Ngam, they were poor in other areas like
                            Kassy, southeastern Wapikhamthong Province, Pakkhanya, and Muong Soui.
                            Some of these unfavorable examples permitted enemy exploitation of the
                            civil populace in attacks against both Lao and Americans.</p>
                        <p>5. The most significant new enemy activity during the recent dry season
                            was increased terrorism against Americans. An <gloss target="#t_IVS1">IVS</gloss> worker was assassinated in Pakkhanya March 25. The
                                <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> house was attacked and
                            looted at Houei Mun in southern Savannakhet March 30, but Americans <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0632"/>had already been withdrawn.
                                <gloss target="#t_LPLA1">LPLA</gloss> troops have been firing on and
                            stopping <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> vehicles at several
                            locations in south Laos during the last few months. The <gloss target="#t_LPLA1">LPLA</gloss> blew a hole with a bazooka round
                            through the <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> house in Kassy June
                            8. No one was killed but some non-Americans were wounded. <gloss target="#t_LPLA1">LPLA</gloss> soldiers have warned villagers near
                            Nong Bok not to ride in American vehicles lest they also become
                            targets.</p>
                        <p>6. This shift to enemy concentration on Americans is in part testimony to
                            the impact <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> efforts are making in
                            rural Laos. Failure to establish full security in cluster and forward
                            area operations has halted or hampered <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> development efforts in Kassy, Nong Bok, Nam Bac,
                            Houei Mun, and Pakkhanya, however.</p>
                        <p>7. Although Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName> attributed the absence of significant
                            Communist military action during the dry season to a Communist desire to
                            freeze the military position along its present lines (State
                                208755),<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">Not found.</note> the North
                            Vietnamese actually tried hard to make advances but were less successful
                            this time. They may well look to a freeze, based on incapacity rather
                            than willingness, as the only means of maintaining the status quo.</p>
                        <p>8. Thus although the recently ended dry season marked modest gains in the
                            government position, the costly war of attrition in Laos is far from
                            over. The North Vietnamese retain their dual objective of keeping the
                            corridor open to South Vietnam, and occupying much of North Laos under
                            the facade of the Lao “Patriotic” Front. They may favor a freeze
                            tactically, judging that for the time being their resources would be
                            better used elsewhere. Strategically, there is no indication of North
                            Vietnam's willingness to abandon its ultimate goals in Laos.</p>

                        <p>Dear Phil:</p>
                        <p>As you are well aware, we have been trying for over two months to resolve
                            the problems posed by the proposed ground surveillance activity in
                            support of Illinois City and the political objections thereto. The areas
                            of controversy are three: first, the expansion of the Prairie Fire
                            operational area; second, the launching of operations [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]; and third,
                            the employment of US/Thai teams in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Since the desired operational date of 1 November is fast approaching, and
                            since the Illinois City capability will be a limited one at that time,
                            we need to reach an agreement promptly on at least a limited, initial
                            program. As time goes on, as the Illinois City program expands, and as
                            our operational experience dictates, we can address the appropriate
                            modifications.</p>
                        <p>The essentials of this limited program are outlined below. It should be
                            realized that this is far less than an optimum solution from a military
                            standpoint and may not prove satisfactory. This would only be an initial
                            effort sufficient to provide limited ground support to the early
                            Illinois City system and to develop operational experience.</p>
                        <p>a. Operations limited geographically to the existing Prairie Fire
                            area.</p>
                        <p>b. Team composition to be US/Vietnamese.</p>
                        <p>c. Operations to be conducted from RVN to the maximum extent
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>d. Operations to be conducted from [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] when weather precludes operations
                            from RVN.</p>
                        <p>e. Teams to be staged through [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] remaining in isolation on the
                            base for minimum periods (probably no more than three nights).</p>
                        <p>f. Use of Muong Phalane in Laos as a site to refuel and replenish
                            ammunition for helicopters when operations are launched [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>As the additional munitions and aircraft become available, the Illinois
                            City system will unquestionably expand its coverage in Laos. Whether the
                            expansion will swing north, south or west (see map attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d300fn2">Not found</note>
                            <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0634"/>is still uncertain and will
                            depend a great deal on what the <gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> reaction will be to the initial
                            efforts. When this expansion takes place a comparable extension of
                            Prairie Fire limits will be required; however, this extension can be
                            deferred and addressed specifically at the appropriate time.</p>
                        <p>The concept of shuttling teams from RVN [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>] is unwieldy and
                            unresponsive and one which <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> has indicated as the least desirable solution.
                            Operational experience with this concept may well dictate that this
                            restriction be modified to permit a longer stay for teams at [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>], or perhaps at some other isolated location [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Again, however, we are prepared to make the initial
                            effort using [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] for minimum staging and control only.</p>
                        <p>We still consider that the use of US/Thai teams for this operation is a
                            worthwhile concept, which should not be finally dismissed. Not only
                            would these teams provide a higher quality source of manpower, but their
                            use would eliminate any political problem which might stem from
                            introduction of Vietnamese into Thailand. The objections to this concept
                            in Embassy Vientiane are still somewhat obscure; and we feel that this
                            idea merits further consideration.</p>
                        <p>In summary we seek your concurrence in the limited program outlined in
                            paragraph 3 above, with the understanding that this should not be
                            considered as a final resolution of those aspects of the plan which we
                            now agree to defer.</p>
                        <p>Sincerely,</p>

                        <p>1. Thanks for the red flag in reftel. I realize tone of three
                                messages<note n="3" xml:id="d302fn3">One of the other messages was
                                telegram 484 from Vientiane to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, July 26, in which <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> complained that a Prairie Fire Spike Team
                                had captured two Lao civilian fishermen and removed them to South
                                Vietnam where they were interrogated and detained because they had
                                seen a member of the Spike Team. Sullivan pointedly asked how <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> planned to return the
                                civilians to Laos “without running even a greater risk of
                                compromising the program than had you permitted them to continue
                                fishing.” (Ibid., POL 27 VIET S) The other message, related to <ref target="#d301">Document 301</ref>, has not been further
                                identified.</note> you cite was harsh and assure you that they were
                            deliberately so phrased after rather lengthy consideration. There are
                            two reasons for this.</p>
                        <p>2. First reason is that military commands as matter deliberate practice
                            seek expand upon and nibble away at restrictions imposed upon them by
                            policy decision. This is a game at the colonel level and continues
                            unabated if met only with gentle demurrers. Unfortunately, these
                            colonels serve only one year duty tours, have no background of history
                            and no future of responsibility. An occasional nasty-gram raised the
                            matter in an attention-arresting way to command levels in an effort to
                            remind commanders that they have policy responsibility even if
                            subordinates ignore it. I realize this skims off some of my popularity
                            rating, but it does usually result in corrective action.</p>
                        <p>3. The second, and perhaps more compelling, reason is a tactical one
                            which has developed around the Department's suggestion for a <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting. Since the subject of
                            the meeting is a rehash of old proposals which were rightfully turned
                            down in Washington last May, Department's failure to turn them down this
                            time is being interpreted by the military as indication that you have
                            weakened on these points and have passed the buck out here to me. Since
                            I have the ill-deserved reputation of being more “realistic” than you
                            fuzzy fellows in Foggy Bottom, they have assumed I would be a patsy for
                            their proposals. I happen to think their proposals are very poorly
                            conceived and have served notice by my three messages that I am going to
                            be most negative in this regard.</p>
                        <p>4. While it may be that, for tactical reasons, it was prudent for you to
                            delay your decisions on this matter until after a <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting, <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0637"/>you and Nick must realize that it has
                            made you look soft on these matters and is going to require me to look
                            hard. If, as I trust, you are still with me in principle, you are going
                            to have to begin looking tough also. I realize it doesn't suit the
                            dignity of State to use quite such tactless language as I have resorted
                            to, but a good firm tone on occasion will close the apparent chinks and
                            crannies.</p>
                        <p>5. As you will realize, I feel very strongly about this because I believe
                            we are once again facing a crucial decision in principle which it might
                            be tempting to sweep under the carpet by what appears to be a minor
                            concession in practice. To my mind the point at issue is not whether
                            Westy or I will control and direct the irregular troops we use in the
                            corridor. (I happen to have more and better ones than he can muster, but
                            that is irrelevant.) It is not even a question whether Souvanna would
                            quit if we abandon clandestine levels and move overly into Laos. (I
                            really believe he will, and for tactical reasons, his quitting could
                            make good sense to him.)</p>
                        <p>6. His quitting would not only face us with the whole dreary cycle we
                            went through once before with General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName> (this time it would probably be <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName>) but, more importantly, it
                            would change the whole name of the game. We would have to accept overt
                            responsibility for the defense of Laos. I am not exaggerating when I say
                            this would require 200,000 U.S. troops. Worse still, it would be at no
                            net advantage to our position in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>7. But, beyond this, we would throw the Soviets right out of the ball
                            game. I may be wrong, but (as you know) I have always maintained that
                            the only way we will get out of this Southeast Asian engagement is by
                            the Soviets moving to persuade North Vietnam to negotiate, after having
                            accepted the responsibility towards Hanoi and the price towards China
                            which this would entail. The U.S.-Soviet agreement on Laos is the
                            stepping stone towards Soviet action on this front. So long as we keep
                            our fighting in Laos clandestine and covert, the Soviets tolerate it. If
                            it becomes overt, they quit and withdraw their stepping stone.</p>
                        <p>8. Now, of all times, is not the time to do this. Civil war seems about
                            to start in China. <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> may
                            be in the process of a change. Hanoi may be having its second thoughts.
                            The Soviets themselves may be shaping up to a move. To kick all this
                            away in favor of a military move which has questionable value (and which
                            in my judgement would boomerang militarily) seems less than
                            statesmanlike.</p>
                        <p>9. Moreover, in purely military terms, Westy's move would accomplish very
                            little at best. The Viets have already set up a new logistics system in
                            Cambodia which would absorb the loss of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The
                            overwhelming proportion of infiltrated personnel are now moving straight
                            across the DMZ rather than through Laos. Our <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> controlled forces in the Panhandle are on the point of
                            a major take-off in the very <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0638"/>territory <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> would like to take
                            over. If they would assign 50 propeller-driven aircraft to work
                            regularly with our assets in the Panhandle, we could clean up those
                            routes and dry up those base areas twelve months of the year.</p>
                        <p>10. Our military friends are getting a juggernaut complex. With <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">John McNaughton</persName> and Des FitzGerald
                            gone, we have to count on a few like you and Nick to keep an eye on the
                            political objective and not let it become lost in the flailings of
                            military expedience. It would be very reassuring if you can reassert
                            your touch with the holy grail.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: An analysis of the enemy's tactical posture in the Lao Armed
                            Forces second military region of northern Laos as of 26 July 1967
                            reveals that the enemy was only able to take one significant piece of
                            terrain from the regular and irregular forces of the Royal Lao
                            Government during the dry season of October 1966 to July 1967. This
                            limited success <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0639"/>put the enemy
                            in control of the Nong Khang (VH–0581) area but this gain was far short
                            of the objectives which the enemy had reportedly set for himself in his
                            1966/1967 dry season offensive. This lack of enemy success has resulted
                            in a tactical shift in the balance of power in the second military
                            region in favor of the regular and irregular forces of the Royal Lao
                            Government under General <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>.
                            As a result of this shift the Royal Lao Government has the opportunity
                            to exercise several offensive options in the second military region
                            during the 1967 rainy season. The successful implementation of these
                            options could contribute to permanently changing the tactical balance of
                            power in northern Laos in favor of the Royal Lao Government. This
                            success by the Royal Lao Government is attributed to General <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>'s improved intelligence
                            apparatus and the fact that it has furnished him with information he
                            could use to hit the enemy with spoiling attacks in staging areas.
                            Individual members of <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>'s
                            regular and guerrilla forces have come to realize they have developed a
                            tactical superiority over the enemy during the past dry season and their
                            morale has improved accordingly. They know from experience that they can
                            successfully defend their position against North Vietnamese Army
                            regulars and that air support and other assistance is close by when they
                            need it. As <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>'s units take
                            the offensive during this current rainy season, they can be expected to
                            expand outward from existing positions in Houa Phan Province. This will
                            include attacks designed to retake Nong Khang. This appraisal updates
                            the previous appraisal [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source

                        <p>1. Once again a visit to Laos impresses me with the substantial gains
                            being made toward [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] overall U.S. objectives.</p>
                        <p>2. South Laos is a particularly striking example of forward motion on
                            these objectives. During the past year roadwatch team effort [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            has been expanded from an intermittent coverage of a few spots to an
                            almost continuous coverage of all major trafficable routes running from
                            North Vietnam through Laos to South Vietnam. A trained and experienced
                            pool of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] teams now rotates so that there are at almost all
                            times [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] teams on the roads. Aside from information
                            provided, this program is causing very substantial damage to the North
                            Vietnamese as they transit Laos. As an example, on the night of 7 July
                            when a roadwatch team reported the passage of 37 trucks, the information
                            was flashed within two minutes through our communications channels to an
                            Air Force command plane in the area, which diverted jets to arrive at
                            the target seven minutes after original sighting to produce a total of
                            50-odd secondary explosions. On the ground, a force of action teams has
                            been developed to produce minings, ambushes, and other attrition against
                            enemy traffic in the panhandle. This marriage of the guerrilla with jet
                            aircraft has caused the enemy in the corridor to suffer the loss of some
                            40 trucks to ground action, and 1,565 to air action, during the period
                            November 1966 to June 1967. To these truck losses can be added the early
                            trickle of what should increase to a steady flow of defectors from the
                            transitting enemy.</p>
                        <p>3. In 1963–64, the Pathet Lao were probing into the Sedone Valley near
                            Pakse and were establishing a foothold on the strategic Bolovens
                            Plateau. The pacification program for this area was conceived by our
                            station and implemented with Country Team help. It was a microcosm of
                            technique now being wrestled with by the <gloss target="#t_CORDS1">CORDS</gloss> structure in Vietnam. <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0641"/>Regular screening forces were organized, self-defense
                            units were trained and armed, economic and social programs were
                            implemented, and a political program of improving local leadership and
                            popular commitment was carried out. The effort followed a careful plan
                            of oilspot expansion. The result this year is that the enemy's threat
                            has been purged from an area up to 90 kilometers east of the Mekong,
                            self-defense forces are now being demobilized, their arms recovered and
                            screening forces are being made available for employment further east
                            against the Ho Chi Minh Trail. There are small “islands” in Vietnam
                            proving the feasibility of this technique of pacification, but in Laos
                            the program indicates how much more can be done if the process is
                            started before the enemy grows to be a major military threat. The
                            example is compelling for application in Thailand and other areas where
                            our enemies might seek to emulate the Viet Cong experience.</p>
                        <p>4. The North Laos “quiet war” goes remarkably well. Some idea of our
                            contribution can be gained by such facts as:</p>
                        <p>A. We completely fund, support, and direct a force of local defense
                            units, area security units and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] special guerrilla battalions,
                            plus heavy weapons units, intelligence teams and a spider-web of
                            communications [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-supported forces in North Laos
                            directly cause the enemy average monthly casualties of 300 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss>, 115 <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss> and an average of 40 defectors and captives processed
                            monthly; they also contribute enormously to casualties from air strikes
                            of some 800 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> per month. In contrast,
                            the Royal Lao Army has caused an average of 70 enemy <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> monthly.</p>
                        <p>C. From its positions dominating all of North Laos some years ago, the
                            Viet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName>/Pathet Lao enemy has
                            been pushed back to holding a thin edge of North Laos, with a single
                            substantial salient into the Plaine des Jarres, and there is even debate
                            among knowledgeable observers whether this should be taken; there is
                            reason to believe that it could be if it were deemed politically and
                            militarily desirable.</p>
                        <p>D. Behind these military successes, the process of consolidating
                            political cohesion and strength of North Laos continues apace. The most
                            successful action has been the integration of the Meo tribe into the Lao
                            Kingdom, instead of allowing our support to become a centrifugal force
                            to fragment rather than coalesce the variety of peoples called Laos.
                            This has involved the development of the Union of Lao Races Radio
                            Station, an enterprise to handle through commercial channels the
                            supplies formerly dropped from the sky (and incidentally, help develop a
                            Meo managerial middle class), and police administrative services [<hi rend="italic">3 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. In the
                            process, Meo school registration has risen from 3,000 in 1962 to 12,000
                            in 1967, settled agriculture is replacing mountain village slash and
                            burn farming, an elected Meo sits in the National Assembly <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0642"/>and there is a Meo among the generals
                            of the Army. Seventy Meo attend the top lycee of Laos where only 10 were
                            present in 1962. Of course, where <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            conceived plans are non-covert, they are supported for the most part by
                            other agencies.</p>
                        <p>5. There are a number of substantial policy problems which will have to
                            be faced relating to the corridor. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            has made a series of recommendations for vigorous prosecution of cross
                            border operations into Laos from South Vietnam. What began as activities
                            by irregular Vietnamese forces (which the U.S. Special Force believes
                            they must accompany) would be increased in terms of regular Vietnamese
                            battalions with U.S. advisory teams and accompanying air and helicopter
                            support. There is always the danger that we may be faced with a general
                            extension of a Vietnam-style war into the corridor. Policy makers will
                            have to consider whether this kind of effort will actually have more
                            real effect than our current ones, as certainly the enemy has shown the
                            capability of utilizing the DMZ itself, maritime infiltration and
                            Cambodian channels. A more serious effect could well be the upsetting of
                            the Souvanna Phouma Government of Laos, which has provided for
                            collaboration of right and neutral wings of Laotian politics with the
                            result that Laos is left as a clearly secondary theater. Polarization of
                            Laotian situation could provoke more forceful probes by the North
                            Vietnamese toward the Mekong with substantial increase in requirements
                            for U.S. defensive support of Thailand and Laos. The most serious policy
                            question, however, would seem to be the degree to which the U.S. wishes
                            to contemplate increased commitment of U.S. forces in active operations
                            in Southeast Asia. The contest in Laos has been by proxy, engaging
                            minimal U.S. prestige, tying down no U.S. forces and involving few
                            casualties.</p>
                        <p>6. There is still much unfinished business for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in Laos. We must have better penetrations of the Pathet
                            Lao and Viet <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Minh</persName> enemy so we
                            know his activities, capabilities, vulnerabilities and intentions in
                            advance, not just by observing him as he passes or as we exchange shots.
                            We must increase our toll on his use of the Lao corridor to Vietnam, by
                            placing more action teams and special guerrilla battalions on the job.
                            We must further exploit the several opportunities Laos offers for
                            intelligence operations into North Vietnam, the Soviet Union and China.
                            We must also assess and assist the process of succession when 67-year
                            old <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> steps down.
                            Our station is fully aware of these areas of challenge and is already
                            attacking them.</p>

                            limit the advantage the enemy derives from use of Cambodian territory.
                            Defense has made it known to us that they have had under consideration a
                            wide variety of actions which would begin with expanded cross-border
                            intelligence operations and aerial reconnaissance and might eventually
                            work up to such actions as establishment of guerrilla warfare operations
                            in northeast Cambodia, blockade of the Mekong, the immediate pursuit of
                            the enemy across the border, and air strikes against known enemy

                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> allied themselves with <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, who has firmly opposed the
                            concept in view of the political and military complications it raises.
                            Although the Department has never been asked for an official view, it is
                                <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss>'s opinion that the Southpaw
                            concept should be opposed for several reasons, primarily because it
                            would violate the principle of keeping allied operations in Laos at a
                            deniable level. We do not know to what extent the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> may press for execution of the Southpaw
                            concept, but we doubt that it will get much of a hearing in the Pentagon
                            in the face of the opposition of CINCPAC and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prairie Fire III</p>
                        <p>Phase III of the Prairie Fire operation includes the use of indigenous
                            tribal personnel (Kha) to conduct guerrilla type operations in the Laos
                            Panhandle. The Joint Staff supports the concept but believes that unless
                            the area of operation can be extended beyond the present Prairie Fire
                            zone, there is little merit in proceeding with it. You will recall,
                            however, that General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName>
                            submitted a proposal to you on July 5<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">Not
                                found.</note> requesting approval of the recruitment and training of
                            Kha and other local tribes in Laos, while deferring the question of
                            extending the Prairie Fire operating zone.</p>
                        <p>The views of the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss>
                            participants are as follows:</p>
                        <p>—Both General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>, to the best of
                            our knowledge support the proposal, either in its limited form or
                            expanded beyond the Prairie Fire area, if possible.</p>
                        <p>—<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> apparently endorses the
                            proposal to recruit guerrilla personnel in Laos, but we deduce from his
                            general position on cross-border operations that he desires to limit the
                            area of ground conflict as close to Viet-Nam as possible, i.e. within
                            the current Prairie Fire area.</p>
                        <p>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> believes that
                            it is unrealistic to initiate Phase III of Prairie Fire on the grounds
                            that there are insufficient personnel to exploit existing opportunities
                            and that it will prove impossible to find 3000 Kha suitable for such
                            operations. He continues to oppose any significant extension of the
                            Prairie Fire zone because of the exposure problem.</p>
                        <p>—Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> also opposed
                            the Phase III plan.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_EA1">EA</gloss>'s view was set forth in a memorandum
                            submitted to you on July 5.<note n="3" xml:id="d305fn3">For <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>'s view, see <ref target="#d295">Document 295</ref>.</note> In brief, we are not
                            persuaded that the added military benefit from moving into a phase of
                            guerrilla combat inside Laos would match the added political costs.
                            Moreover, as noted by Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in expressing some of their objections to <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0645"/>Dye Marker (see following),
                            there is more we can do in this area along current lines of action.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> Dye Marker (Formerly Illinois City and Practice
                            Nine)</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting brought out
                            clearly the uneasiness of officials in the field regarding the Dye
                            Marker concept and the way the project has proceeded.</p>
                        <p>We have learned from cables amplifying the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> summary cable that Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> now have strong reservations about Dye Marker,
                            particularly the anti-vehicular phase which involves operations west of
                            the Prairie Fire area. They argue that by doing more and better what we
                            are doing now, particularly with propeller planes and current and
                            planned Lao indigenous forces under <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            control, we can critically reduce infiltration except via Cambodia. They
                            believe Dye Marker will not work and will cut across efforts now in
                            train which will work.</p>
                        <p>We are not certain how strongly Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> support the project although the plan bears
                                <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s signature. We
                            know that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> were not originally
                            keen on it but that there was strong pressure in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to get it moving.</p>
                        <p>We have had our own doubts about the efficacy of the program but were
                            willing to let DOD give it a limited trial and, indeed, Ambassadors
                                <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> seemed to share this view as
                            of last spring, when only the anti-infiltration measures close to the
                            Viet-Nam border were being considered in detail. In the light of the
                            concerns about this project both here and in the field, we are planning
                            to have a thorough-going review of the entire project when we have
                            received the report of the Dye Marker working group set up by <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss>. We will keep you informed as
                            it progresses.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Commando Lava</p>
                        <p>The code name identifies a soil destabilization project on which
                            successful experiments have recently been conducted in southern Laos.
                            The process involves application to the soil in target areas of a
                            harmless dry powder which breaks down soil stability. Both <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> have expressed interest in
                            operational use of this technique to create untrafficable mud fields
                            along road and infiltration trail routes and, possibly, to supplement
                            mine fields in strengthening defensive perimeters in hostile areas.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> is most
                            anxious that the technique be applied in northern Laos as well as in the
                            Panhandle and anticipates no difficulty in obtaining <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName>'s concurrence in the
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>, Mr.
                                <persName>Bundy</persName> and other Department officials have been
                            briefed by the technical experts on the first experimental effort. We
                            believe that the political problems which might result from the Commando
                            Lava project would be manageable and we expect to forward a favorable
                            recommendation to you when DOD is ready to recommend a specific
                            operational plan.</p>

                                informed <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that “the

                                should be a “line of coordination” rather than an “iron curtain” to
                                allow tactical flexibility and to deny the enemy “safe havens.” He
                                asked <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> to accept this
                                concept. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Your message on Prairie Fire touches on the question of the
                            collaborative effort required to deal with the problem of enemy
                            operations on Lao territory. I fully endorse this principle of
                            collaboration and assure you that I also subscribe to the principle of
                            flexibility, within the limits fixed by the imperatives of our larger
                            national objectives here in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>2. However I would like to stress three points which I will wish to
                            discuss with you in further detail tomorrow at Udorn.</p>
                        <p>A. The Prairie Fire zone is not a piece of territory which has been
                            detached from my responsibilities in Laos and given over to your
                            command. It is instead an area in Laos where <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> is permitted to conduct certain types of operations
                            which have been agreed to by higher authority in Washington, subject to
                            my concurrence. Therefore, question does not arise of you “allowing” CAS
                            Road Watch teams to land in Prairie Fire zone. I will send Road Watch
                            teams anywhere in Laos I feel they are needed, including Prairie Fire
                            zone, if that seems the best method of handling the problem. Naturally,
                            if I undertake any operations in the Prairie Fire zone, I will effect
                            the closest coordination with <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss>
                            to avoid conflict. In practice, I feel it is best to avoid <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operations in the Prairie Fire zone
                            because of possible conflicts and confusions. However, the principle
                            exists and is valid.</p>
                        <p>B. On the other hand, there is not a reciprocation in principle for
                            Prairie Fire operations in Laos elsewhere than the Prairie Fire zone. In
                            practice, there has been one instance of Prairie Fire authorization west
                            of the zone, although this has required clearance with Washington.</p>
                        <p>C. The case at issue is not quite so black and white as you have
                            described it. It was not a question of employing Prairie Fire forces
                            against a known enemy force astride the boundary of the Prairie Fire
                            zone. The circumstances are as follows:</p>
                        <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0647"/>
                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> special guerrilla unit is in the
                            area of an enemy force which is well west of the Prairie Fire zone. For
                            Prairie Fire teams to attack in this area would have required their
                            introduction into the vicinity of our <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> unit, from which they would then have mounted their
                            action. This would have brought the Prairie Fire team into potential
                            conflict with the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> unit. For this
                            reason it was decided that the <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> unit
                            would undertake the mission and it is currently moving to engage the
                            enemy. While it is true that there are other elements of the enemy
                            (probably associated with the same organization), which are located east
                            of the Prairie Fire zone, the circumstances of their total disposition
                            are such that it does not seem to me to give rise to the considerations
                            reflected in last sentence para 2 reftel.</p>
                        <p>3. This business of coordination requires the closest and most trusting
                            mutual efforts. It will not be otherwise unless the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> turns Singlaub and his <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> unit over to me or else the
                            President names you Ambassador to Laos. The larger national interests
                            would suggest that we avoid both these extremes. Warm regards.<note n="3" xml:id="d306fn3">Printed from an unsigned copy.</note>

                                791 from Vientiane, August 12. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                POL 27 VIET S)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and I met privately to
                            discuss matters of coordination between us. Specifically, I expressed my
                            concern that his staff, based on his guidance, had interpreted the
                            coordination line for Prairie Fire operations to be a barrier that could
                                <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0648"/>not be crossed regardless
                            of contingencies. I objected to this interpretation as contrary to sound
                            military practice. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            suggested, and I agreed, that our representatives sit down and trace a
                            new Prairie Fire line to include certain terrain features and roads that
                            naturally fall in the Prairie Fire area. Following this, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> will ask Washington to approve
                            the adjusted line. I put forth the proposition that we should go through
                            our respective channels and urge that the new line be accepted by State
                            and Defense as a coordination line, not a barrier, and we should be
                            delegated authority to coordinate operations across the line on a
                            contingency basis. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> would
                            not agree with this and implied that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> would take advantage of the situation if such
                            authority were delegated. When I pointed out that he would retain a veto
                            in any given situation, he made the point that he might be succeeded by
                            a weaker individual who might be overwhelmed by the military.</p>
                        <p>2. It is incomprehensible to me that coordination of operations across a
                            line on a map cannot be delegated to senior officials in the field.
                            Despite <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s attitude, I
                            recommend that when the new Prairie Fire lines come to State and Defense
                            for approval that Defense urge State to agree to authorize <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> and Embassy Vientiane to coordinate
                            operations on a contingency basis across the line without reference to
                            Washington. Failure to permit this creates delays in reacting to
                            intelligence and, in my view, makes no sense whatsoever. Needless to
                            say, most requests to operate across the coordination line will be from
                            this flank. At the same time, Embassy Vientiane will have veto authority
                            which hopefully would be exercised, not arbitrarily, but in accordance
                            with the best interest of our war efforts.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss> has recommended expanded
                            operations in Laos in two proposed programs: Prairie Fire Phase III
                            (organizing an indigenous <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0649"/>guerrilla force in the eastern Panhandle) and Southpaw (airmobile
                            operations into Laos by regular <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss>
                            units). You had briefings on these programs during your last visit to
                            Saigon.</p>
                        <p>The Prairie Fire Phase III concept, previously recommended by the Joint
                            Chiefs of staff, was considered at the 1 August <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting in Saigon where it
                            was agreed in principle there were no objections provided operations are
                            restricted to the existing Prairie Fire area in Laos. Agreement was
                            reached that representatives of <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            and American Embassy, Vientiane would review the specific details in
                            order that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            might assess the political implication of these operations in terms of
                            their impact on the Royal Lao Government. Results of this review and
                            assessment by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            have not reported but are expected soon. Department of State concurrence
                            in Phase III of Prairie Fire is anticipated.</p>

                            recommend that Southpaw not be implemented at this time since they
                            consider that the political and military risks outweigh the merits of
                            the proposed concept. They leave open the possibility that future
                            conditions may warrant a re-evaluation.</p>

                        <p>1. Decision here is that there must be U.S. leadership and technical
                            skill in ground teams for support of Dye Marker anti-personnel
                                system.<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">In telegram 2671 from Bangkok,
                                September 2, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> complained that this decision was not borne
                                out by the facts being examined by the Dye Marker Subcommittee of
                                    <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> suggested that it looked as
                                if “subordinate staff personnel” had “jammed through decision before
                                facts were presented.” (Ibid.)</note> Accordingly either
                            US/Vietnamese or US/Thai teams will be used to provide this support.</p>
                        <p>2. Because bad weather precludes launching of teams from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> during most of December–March,
                            facilities and authority must exist for such launching [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                        <p>3. Judgment here is that overcoming Thai reluctance to permit [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            teams to stage through Nakhon Phanom, utilizing isolated, fenced
                            facilities, is less formidable obstacle than political risk to Souvanna
                            of use of US/Thai teams.</p>
                        <p>4. Accordingly, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName>
                            should again seek Thai concurrence for staging [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source that not declassified</hi>] teams through [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                                from Bangkok, September 8, <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> reported he had received agreement from the
                                Thai Government, which insisted that [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                    declassified</hi>] team's stays in Thailand be very limited.
                                (Ibid.)</note> We are sure that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] would be prepared to go to
                            Bangkok give Dye Marker briefing to Dawee and others as appropriate.
                            This would emphasize the importance we place upon this project and upon
                            the absolute requirement for use of Nakhon Phanom as a staging base.
                            Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> should not hesitate
                            to ask for this assistance if he believes it would be helpful in
                            securing Thai concurrence.</p>
                        <p>5. Requirement to launch from Nakhon Phanom means that a refueling area
                            in Laos must be utilized. Request Amb. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s recommendation where this could be placed. We
                            assume Amb. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> will not
                            wish to secure Souvanna's permission to conduct such refueling.</p>
                        <p>6. The anti-personnel system will initially be located substantially
                            within the existing Prairie Fire area.</p>
                        <p>7. With reference to anti-vehicular system, assume any problems will be
                            overcome by work of coordinating group now meeting in Saigon.</p>

                        <p>The President then asked General <persName>Johnson</persName> to have the
                            Joint Chiefs “search for imaginative ideas to put pressure to bring this
                            war to a conclusion.” He said he did not want them to just recommend
                            more men or that we drop the Atom bomb. The President said he could
                            think of those ideas. The President asked <persName>Johnson</persName>
                            to have the Joint Chiefs come up with some new programs. He pointed out
                            that when this Congress comes back in January they will try to bring the
                            war to a close either by getting out or by escalating significantly. The
                            President asked <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName> to
                            put on a chart the good items represented in the “Blueprint.”<note n="2" xml:id="d310fn2">The “Blueprint for Vietnam,” August 26, is

                        </p>
                        <p>The President then read excerpts from the “Blueprint.” (Copy of this is
                            attached.)</p>
                        <p>After reading paragraph B from the “Blueprint” memorandum concerning
                            approval of an elite battalion-size South Vietnamese force with U.S.
                            advisors to raid enemy supply bases in Laos—Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that we can do a good many
                            things with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> if
                            the President will spend an hour with him when he is here this fall.</p>
                        <p>The President said yes, I have already agreed to that.</p>
                        <p>In response to Paragraph A concerning approval and expedition of “Dye
                            Marker” program for electronic devices in Laos to be used in connection
                            with the air program—<persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            said that “Dye Marker” is a barrier and he does not expect any trouble
                            in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Again referring to Paragraph B (the South Vietnamese and U.S. troops
                            raiding the enemy supply bases in Laos)—<persName>Johnson</persName>
                            said it will become known in Laos because of the way the correspondents
                            travel out there. General <persName>Johnson</persName> pointed out that
                            this meant violation of the Geneva Accords of 1962. He also said that
                            this action would create no military problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> pointed out that the key
                            problem is getting <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> aboard.</p>
                        <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0652"/>
                        <p>The President said if we get Souvanna aboard, then should we go ahead and
                            do it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied, yes.</p>
                        <p>The President asked that we give some thought on how we can do this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said maybe we can get some
                            Laotian troops in on this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> says this is worth
                            doing if we can do it, and if we can keep from destroying Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>The President then read from Paragraph D concerning “obtaining for Laos
                            corridor work additional propeller type aircraft by the beginning of the
                            next dry season.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> replied that there are
                            “lots of aircraft there now.” He pointed out that the weather has been
                            bad and also that not many trucks have been moving down the corridor.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> has not asked for any
                            propeller aircraft that has not been approved.</p>
                        <p>General <persName>Johnson</persName> agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked “if we couldn't fly a
                            good many planes out of Laos as Laotian planes, even with our
                            pilots.”</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said “we don't have to

                        <p>September 12, 1967.</p>
                        <p>Things I recommend we do in connection with the Vietnam war are:</p>
                        <p>1. Improve our interdiction efforts in Laos by:</p>
                        <p>a. Approval and expedition of “Dye Marker” program for electronic devices
                            in Laos to be used in connection with air program. (This now I believe
                            approved by our Ambassador to Laos, subject to working out details to
                            blend with his guerrilla program there.)</p>
                        <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0653"/>
                        <p>b. Approval of use of elite battalion-size South Vietnamese forces (with
                            U.S. advisors) to raid enemy supply bases in Laos. (We now have 12-man
                            teams operating there, and this would merely enlarge the size of the
                            team. They would not stay in Laos permanently, but would hit and run.
                            Our Ambassador to Laos is opposed to this because he believes it would
                            become known, and Souvanna might resign. We believe if North Vietnamese
                            troops violate Geneva Convention by being in Laos, South Vietnamese
                            troops have a right to oppose them, and solving infiltration problem
                            central to winning war, and risk of Souvanna reaction must be taken. We
                            see little additional risk beyond what we are now doing, and believe
                            U.S. Ambassador to Laos principally afraid of future use of U.S. troops
                            in Laos on massive scale. We can cross this bridge when we come to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>c. Other measures suggested by General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> in briefing of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, which I believe have now
                            been approved by everyone.</p>
                        <p>d. Obtaining for Laos corridor work additional propeller-type aircraft by
                            beginning next dry season (December). Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName> have impressive statistics that
                            propeller craft hit over twice as many trucks as jets per given number
                            of sorties. Air Force prefers jets, if they have to choose, because they
                            can be used in North Vietnam during Laos monsoon season, whereas
                            propeller planes cannot be used there because of excessive antiaircraft
                            fire. I believe that if more propeller planes would improve
                            interdiction, they should be used there even if they are laid up six
                            months out of the year, and they should be additional to, not in lieu
                            of, other planes needed by Air Force. Air Force does not accept
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> figures.</p>

                            working stag luncheon for 3 people. Later, Souvanna will see the Vice

                                <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Averell Harriman</persName>. He leaves
                            the country Saturday evening on his way to visit Australia.</p>
                        <p>He is anxious to have a thorough discussion with you on the current
                            situation in Southeast Asia and the chances for peace. He has been
                            shaken by the accounts he has read of domestic opposition and needs
                            reassurance that our commitment in Southeast Asia is firm. You might
                            also wish to:</p>
                        <p>—Assure him we seek no wider war and intend to try to try to keep the
                            Viet Nam war within its current boundaries.</p>
                        <p>—Express appreciation for his speech at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> (October 13), in which he emphasized the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s responsibility for peacekeeping.</p>
                        <p>—Express concern about the rice crop (which was hurt by floods last year
                            and droughts this year).</p>
                        <p> Souvanna will probably raise the following matters:</p>
                        <p>—His concern at the effects on Laos of the continuing war (each year
                            1500–2000 Lao are killed in combat—the per capita equivalent of 100,000
                            American combat deaths a year).</p>
                        <p>—He may plead for decisive action to bring the war to an end. In the
                            past, he has privately argued that we should increase the pressure on
                            North Viet Nam by bombing the dikes and other civilian targets. In New
                            York he spoke at length with Ambassador Goldberg, urging a 15 day
                            bombing pause on the basis that there was an obligation to try anything
                            that might bring a settlement.</p>
                        <p>—The Laotian need for additional military assistance because, in his
                            view, Laos can no longer support the financial burden of both national
                            defense and economic development. If he raises this point, I suggest
                            that you reply that we are aware of his needs and are undertaking to
                            provide for them.</p>
                        <p>A particular problem which Souvanna will probably raise with you is “the
                            barrier”. He is very fearful that “the barrier” will cause the North <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0655"/>Vietnamese to be more
                            aggressive in Laos, that it may lead us to commit U.S. forces overtly
                            into Laos, and that we may use the barrier as an excuse to stop bombing
                            North Viet Nam. Any of these actions, he thinks, would lengthen rather
                            than shorten the war. He is absolutely opposed to any overt U.S. troop
                            presence in Laos and has made it plain that he will have no choice but
                            to publicly denounce any overt military presence as a violation of
                            Laotian neutrality.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has discussed
                            “the barrier” plan with Souvanna, obtained his agreement to the
                            introduction into Laos of an Air-Delivered Detection System, and assured
                            Souvanna that we have no intention of introducing “any manner of ground
                            system into Laos.” Souvanna has reserved the right to approve the
                            precise location of the detection system before it is installed.</p>
                        <p>If he raises this matter, I think you will want to reaffirm Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s reassurances.</p>
                        <p>A special caution. Our sensitive operations in Laos are something which
                            Souvanna seldom discusses, even with his closest colleagues. Except when
                            you are talking with him privately you should avoid mention of any
                            operations in Laos unless Souvanna specifically raises them. Also,
                            Souvanna does not expect, and would not be pleased by an expression of
                            “gratitude” for his cooperation. In every instance, his cooperation has
                            been obtained on the basis of Lao national interests. Souvanna does not
                            consider that we are allies, but rather that harsh conditions force us
                            to work together on some matters because “we are in the same boat.”</p>
                        <p>Another caution concerns the Prairie Fire program in which we operate
                            intelligence patrols in the Laotian Panhandle. Souvanna has made it very
                            clear that he could never officially agree to these operations. So far
                            as we are concerned in discussions with him, he wishes to pretend that
                            this program does not exist.</p>
                        <p> Souvanna will be accompanied by his daughter, Princess Moune (pronounced
                            Moon)—a tough-minded woman and a principal figure in the Lao Foreign
                            Ministry. At Souvanna's request, she will be present at your “stag”
                            luncheon. Souvanna is also accompanied by his Minister of Finance,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sisouk</persName> (See sook), the second
                            most powerful man in the government and Souvanna's heir-apparent.</p>

                                    259</ref>.</note> the President told the Prime Minister that he
                            looked forward very much to conversation and luncheon with him at the
                            White House.</p>
                        <p>The President asked the Prime Minister for his views on the situation in
                            his country and remarked how much confidence he had in Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and the reports he
                            receives from him.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Situation</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister emphasized that the difficult situation of his country
                            was caused more by the war than by political and economic causes. His
                            government had made progress in reducing corruption and in stabilizing
                            the currency thanks to the friendly countries which contributed to the
                            stabilization fund.</p>
                        <p>This year, thanks to <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>, $6 million
                            had been programmed for the building of small dams and irrigation
                            projects and the purchase of seeds, insecticides, and fertilizers. The
                            Prime Minister felt that his country should once again become an
                            exporter of rice. Today, with 100 thousand young men under arms there
                            was a shortage of labor and therefore production of rice was inadequate.
                            He intended to supplement labor with mechanized tools. The Prime
                            Minister recalled his conversation on the subject of agriculture
                            development with the Vice President when he visited Vientiane last
                                year.<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">See <ref target="#d220">Document

                        </p>
                        <p>The President remarked that the Vice President very much wanted to meet
                            with the Prime Minister again. The President also invited the Prime
                            Minister and the other members of his party to return for an informal
                                <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0657"/>luncheon at the White House

                                informal lunch at 12:15 p.m. on Saturday, October 21. Additional
                                talking points were prepared for this meeting at the request of the
                                White House. (Memorandum from Read to <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>, October 21, with attached talking points;

                            Secretary of State, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, and the Vice President. The Prime Minister
                            said he welcomed such an opportunity because he had many different
                            matters to discuss with the President.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">War Cost</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister resumed his presentation, pointing out that he has to
                            wage two wars. He said he would only outline broadly his problems at
                            this time and would go into more details in subsequent conversations.
                            The first was the military one but the second war, the economic war, had
                            to be waged in parallel. The Prime Minister emphasized that winning the
                            military war while neglecting the economic one would only expose his
                            country to the risk of Pathet Lao, Communist subversion. He wanted the
                            US Government to be clearly aware of the fact that Laos is in a state of
                            war where it loses 10 to 20 men every day.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that we were keenly aware of the heavy burden
                            this represents for Laos.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> US Assistance</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stressed that in addition to the high cost in human
                            lives, half the Lao budget goes into defense (he cited $50 million as
                            his annual budget). Thus, he would be very happy if the US Government
                            would help in some circuitous way, because the neutrality of Laos had to
                            be maintained, to relieve these financial pressures.</p>
                        <p>The President remarked that we also have great budgetary problems and
                            that we spend $75 billion on defense out of a $130 billion budget. The
                            President said he was trying to get additional taxes passed and his
                            foreign aid program had just been cut by one-third.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked if some way could be found to place under
                            Defense assistance some of the items which at the moment were funded by
                                <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>. He cited such items as refugee
                            care, consumables for the armed forces, etc. The President advised him
                            to discuss this with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister told the President he had read his San Antonio speech
                            with great attention and also the Secretary of State's press conference
                            with much interest.<note n="5" xml:id="d312fn5">For text of the speech,

                            Unfortunately, there was no improvement in <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0658"/>the North Vietnamese attitude on the war. The President
                            noted that in recent days North Vietnam's position was even harsher.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked what would the US Government do, would it also
                            harden its own stand? The President replied that we would continue with
                            what we have been doing, we would continue to apply the pressure we had
                            been applying.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister stressed the vital interest of his country in this
                            subject because the majority of the North Vietnamese equipment that
                            infiltrated to the south went through Laos. If the US Government
                            hardened its stand, the Lao would be happy, the Prime Minister
                            continued, if all passes from North Vietnam into Laos are very heavily
                            bombed. The Lao fear that during the next dry season North Vietnam may
                            launch an offensive against Laos. Since North Vietnam has failed to
                            achieve victory in the South, or at the 17th parallel south of the
                                <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, during the next dry season it
                            might very well turn against Laos. The President assured the Prime
                            Minister that we would do all we could to prevent such an event. The
                            Prime Minister stressed that the North Vietnamese could draw upon
                            reserves that his own country did not have.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Prospects for Peace</p>
                        <p>The President asked him what he thought about Hanoi's present intentions
                            as opposed to a year ago when he and the Prime Minister last met. The
                            Prime Minister replied that last year upon his return to Vientiane he
                            had asked the NVN Charge what Hanoi would do if the US ceased bombing.
                            The Charge had replied that Hanoi would not accept anything short of a
                            final and unconditional cessation of bombing. Both the Prime Minister
                            and the President agreed that this was the standard answer that had been
                            heard for several years.</p>
                        <p>The President asked him how he thought that the war could be brought to
                            an end. The Prime Minister replied that he thought pressure could be
                            brought upon the Soviet Union to exert its influence on Hanoi toward
                            that end. The President pointed out that the Soviet Union had already
                            tried this but the Chinese Communists were opposed.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked the Prime Minister if he felt we were nearer
                            peace today than a year ago. The Prime Minister replied that perhaps
                            this might be the case although it was a very difficult question to
                            answer and one which he had discussed many times. His own feeling was
                            that during November and December we should try to subject North Vietnam
                            to extremely heavy bombings including all the access roads into Laos.
                            Then there would remain no strategic targets in the north.</p>
                        <p>The President took the Prime Minister and other invited guests to the
                            luncheon.</p>

                        <p>During his luncheon with the President, the Prime Minister formulated in
                            greater detail his proposal regarding a pause in the bombing: the United
                            States should bomb very intensively during the months of November and
                            December, destroying practically every strategic objective still left in
                            North Vietnam. It should then proclaim a halt to the bombing around
                            Christmas or New Year without in any way indicating for how long it
                            intended to stop the bombing. This pause would be in response to demands
                            of public opinion both here and abroad and to the statements made by a
                            number of governments (Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the
                            Netherlands, etc.) that by stopping the bombings the United States would
                            create a climate favorable to the initiation of negotiations. Although
                            the bombing would be halted over North Vietnam, the United States should
                            continue to bomb very intensively all access roads leading from North
                            Vietnam into Laos to preclude the infiltration of men and supplies
                            through Laos. This could easily be achieved by blocking a limited number
                            of mountain passes which were the only accesses into Laos; these were
                            mountainous terrains with no population and no Lao citizen would suffer
                            from these bombings.</p>
                        <p>After about a week of the bombing pause the United States should begin to
                            pressure the governments mentioned above to help bring about
                            negotiations. After another eight days or so, if there still had been no
                            opening of talks, the United States should redouble its pressure on
                            these countries, pointing out that the United States had brought the
                            bombing to a halt and that there were still no talks with Hanoi. The
                            Prime Minister felt that if after two to three weeks there had been no
                            indication that Hanoi was going to open talks, the United States, having
                            demonstrated its <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0660"/>good-will to
                            the world, could resume its freedom of action without further
                                delay.<note n="2" xml:id="d313fn2">At 3:30 p.m. on October 20,

                                Soviet Union in Laos. Souvanna noted that whenever he asked the

                                solved as soon as the problem of Vietnam is solved.” (Memoranda of

                        <p>The Secretary said he felt he had to ask the Prime Minister one question
                            even though he knew the answer the Prime Minister would give him. We
                            believe that we have a direct, clear, and simple commitment from the
                            Soviets with respect to Laos. This is the result of the meeting between
                            President <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> and Chairman
                            Khrushchev. It is an understanding that affects the totality of our
                            relations with the Soviet Union. Did the Prime Minister believe that
                            there was one chance in a thousand <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0661"/>that the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos would be
                            respected by North Vietnam before a settlement took place in

                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and Souvanna also talked
                                during the dinner on the evening of October 20. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> asked Souvanna if he had any
                                contact with <persName corresp="#p_Souphanouvong1">Souphanouvong</persName>, and Souvanna replied only a long
                                letter several months ago rehashing standard Pathet Lao positions.
                                When asked by the Deputy Administrator, Rutherford Poat, who was
                                also at the dinner, if Laos would return to a tripartite government
                                if the civil war ended, Souvanna answered heatedly that it would not
                                be the case. (Memorandum of conversation, October 20, 8 p.m.; ibid.,

                        </p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that he did not think there was such a chance;
                            in his many conversations with the Soviets on Laos he had always
                            stressed that the question of Laos was settled in Geneva in 1962, that
                            Laos has nothing to do with the Vietnam question. He said the Soviets
                            never answered directly, but always advised him to be patient, his
                            problem would be settled as soon as the problem of Vietnam was settled.
                            The Secretary pointed out that Vietnam had not been considered at all in
                            the 1962 Agreement. The Prime Minister concurred and added that the
                            North Vietnamese had violated the agreement immediately after it was
                            signed and had, in fact, never pulled back their troops.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said Moscow was well aware of the fact that North
                            Vietnam had an absolute need to use Lao territory for infiltrating into
                            South Vietnam. He said he had pointed out to Moscow that he had
                            requested the United States to intervene in Laos because of this
                            violation of the 1962 Agreement by North Vietnam; if North Vietnam had
                            not violated the agreements there would have been no need for US
                            assistance. He had repeatedly stressed to the Soviets, he said, that US
                            aid was requested after large-scale fighting broke out in North Laos. As
                            far back as the middle of 1963, he added, North Vietnam had ordered the
                            Pathet Lao ministers to leave Vientiane on the grounds that it was not
                            safe there; this was a lie—at the time all was calm in Vientiane. The
                            real reason for the order was that North Vietnam felt the Lao factions
                            were getting close to an agreement among themselves and if such an
                            agreement were reached the Royal Lao Government would control all the
                            territory then occupied by the Pathet Lao, thereby hampering North
                            Vietnamese passage through Laos. (The Prime Minister seems to have
                            forgotten that the assassination of the Foreign Minister in April 1963
                            triggered the abrupt departure of the two Pathet Lao ministers.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he felt the fact that Russia has never denied the
                            existence of a specific agreement on Laos could be useful one day. The
                            Prime Minister said if we could get the Soviet Union to tell Hanoi to
                            leave Laos alone just as Hanoi wanted the United States to leave Vietnam
                            alone, then there might be some hope for Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the Prime Minister if North Vietnamese helicopters
                            were ever observed over Laos. The Prime Minister said the North <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0662"/>Vietnamese have only Soviet
                            helicopters and they do not have sufficient range to fly over Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that in 1964 he had asked Peking and Hanoi for a
                            declaration of their respective policies toward Laos but had been
                            unsuccessful in obtaining one. He had no difficulty, however, in
                            obtaining a statement about US policy from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said the only way for Laos to have peace is for the
                            North Vietnamese to go home. He added that their presence in Laos was
                            simply a matter of socialist expansion, when he tells the Soviets and
                            other socialist countries that they are interfering in Laos, they tell
                            him that the United States is interfering in Vietnam. The Prime Minister
                            said he must constantly repeat that Vietnam had nothing to do with
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered if it would be advantageous to obtain from a
                            number of Asian governments a declaration of policy regarding Laos
                            similar to the declaration of 1962; he had in mind countries such as
                            India, Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan. He said that although some
                            countries were reluctant to take a stand on Vietnam, they might not
                            hesitate to take a stand on Laos. He added that we did not conceive of
                            peace in South Vietnam as opening the way for further North Vietnamese
                            aggression into Laos. The Prime Minister said he did not believe the
                            North Vietnamese would dare attack Laos after peace had been restored in
                            Vietnam. Laos is attacked now, he said, because North Vietnam needed to
                            use Lao territory in infiltrating South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said that North Vietnam was to a very large extent
                            still glorying in its victory at Dien Bien Phu, still considering itself
                            invincible. The Secretary said that for the past week or ten days Hanoi
                            has been increasingly negative and harsh and expressed the hope that he
                            and the Prime Minister would maintain close contact in order to
                            ascertain North Vietnamese and Communist Chinese intentions. The Prime
                            Minister said he would do all he could to develop more specific
                            information, but said that the North Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires in
                            Vientiane was very quiet. He added that Hanoi's recent harshness might
                            conceal an intention to accept some form of arrangement. The Secretary
                            asked if the Prime Minister felt that Hanoi's decisions were being
                            affected by internal strife among North Vietnamese leaders. The Prime
                            Minister said he did not think such internal factors were at work in
                            Hanoi, that under their socialist regime decisions were made
                            collectively. The Secretary asked if under such a system six or eight
                            leaders sat around a table and one of them dissented, did that not make
                            him a traitor in the eyes of the others and render his expression of
                            opinion much more difficult? The Prime Minister recalled that when he
                            was at Khang Khay, discussions would go on for a very long time and if,
                            at the end of a meeting, the Pathet Lao leaders had not reached an
                            agreement, they would simply close the meeting <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0663"/>and resume it the next day. Sometimes
                            discussions would go on for two weeks or a month until a consensus had
                            been obtained.<note n="3" xml:id="d314fn3">At 12:15 p.m., October 21,

                                United Nations. Souvanna answered that he feared it would go the way
                                of the League of Nations. As for Vietnam, the United Nations could
                                not be much help as North and South Vietnam and the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> were not members. Souvanna

                        <p>1. Increase air interdiction in Laos and along NVN borders—selective

                            interdiction airstrike zones in Laos; e.g., NW of <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, Nape and Mu Gia passes.</p>
                        <p>2. Eliminate operational restrictions on B–52s with regard to Laos—allow
                            overflights of Laos by day or night, by B–52s to or from targets in Laos
                            and Viet-Nam; allow daylight bombing in Laos; eliminate requirement for

                            targets in Laos; allow limited penetration Lao airspace during approach
                            to and withdrawal from targets outside Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. Expand Prairie Fire operations in Laos—consider limited increase in
                            size of teams, but not approve <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            request for battalion sized units; authorize <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> to work out specific

                        <p>I know you have heard these ideas before. But since they are likely to

                        <p>At a breakfast meeting at the White House on November 21, 1967, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> met with his Saigon
                            and Washington advisers. The discussion dealt mostly with Vietnam, but
                            the President raised the issue of operations in Laos:</p>
                        <p>“The President asked about recommendations for operations inside
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> said he was
                            anxious to initiate action in base area 607. He pointed out that the
                            missiles that hit Da Nang came through this base area. He said this
                            action would require two Vietnamese battalions and a raid of three to
                            four days.</p>
                        <p>“Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> said he was
                            anxious to see this act taken. 80% of their supplies come through Laos.
                            'To give them a free hand is suicidal.'</p>
                        <p>“General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said over the
                            past 12–18 months the enemy has built a truck road through this area. He
                            said the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree that within the next 60 to 90 days
                            General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> should be
                            authorized to initiate action in this area.” (Johnson Library, Tom

                        <p>In the meantime, some preliminary observations.</p>
                        <p>—There has been a manyfold increase in trucks sighted, damaged, and

                        </p>
                        <p>—Most of the traffic has been in the upper panhandle.</p>
                        <p>—Truckable mileage is 600 compared to 300 last November and 400 in
                            September 1967, although only relatively short segments are in use.</p>
                        <p>—Surveillance has been more extensive this year.</p>
                        <p>—Weather has permitted large-scale trucking beginning the last week of
                            October, whereas last year traffic flow was restricted until late

                        <p>Increased truck activity could result from a combination of the
                            following:</p>

                        <p>The President asked about the over-flight of B–52s over Laos.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> had some problems with
                            this. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> recommended
                            night-time flying if this is possible.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> said there are
                            three aspects involved:</p>
                        <p>(1) Recommends doing away with restriction against flying over Laos
                            during the day and night. This will shorten the turn-around time, will
                            permit the B–52s to get up to their twelve hundred sorties per month,
                            and will cut down on operational cost.</p>
                        <p>(2) Even trained eyes cannot identify B–52s flying at 20,000 to 30,000
                            feet, and tell them apart from KC–135s which are permitted to fly over
                            Laos now.</p>
                        <p>(3) It is no longer necessary to couple strikes in South Vietnam with the
                            flights out of Thailand since B–52s stationed on Guam are hitting areas
                            in South Vietnam already.</p>
                        <p>The President approved the over-flights.<note n="2" xml:id="d318fn2">This

                                that this success meant that practically none of the dry season
                                cargo was reaching as far south as Route 9 and that he anticipated
                                that the North Vietnamese would soon run out of trucks for the
                                trail. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I have just been informed that the President is very much interested
                            in the recent success of the air strikes against trucks in Laos as
                            reported in reference. He desires that you be informed of his interest
                            and further, that you assure that all possible usable resources are
                            being applied in order to get maximum effectiveness in this area. I
                            might add that I too am impressed with these successes, particularly
                            since as I understand it, approximately 95 percent of these results have
                            been obtained at night. This I regard as phenomenal.</p>
                        <p>2. In this regard, <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> has validated the
                            figures contained in the reference and confirms that the total number of
                            trucks destroyed in the Panhandle during the month of November will be
                            approximately 600. On the other hand, <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> believes that the conclusion contained in the
                            reference, that practically no cargoes are reaching the Route 9 area is
                            optimistic since truck sighting figures exceeded damaged and destroyed
                            vehicles during the period 1–25 November by approximately five to one.
                            In addition, about 200 of the trucks reported destroyed or damaged were
                            northbound and probably were not loaded with cargoes destined for areas
                            of Route 9. <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> estimates that more than
                            300 trucks are currently operated by North Vietnam in this sector of the
                            Ho Chi Minh Trail and are backed up by approximately 2,000 more.
                            Nevertheless, there is no doubt but that we are reducing enemy logistic
                            capabilities in the major combat area, and we are hurting him (I believe
                            more than we realize). Therefore, we should keep up the good work.</p>
                        <p>3. I would imagine that the implementation of the Mud River project<note n="3" xml:id="d319fn3">Not further identified.</note> on 1 December
                            will contribute significantly towards your continuing successes in this
                            area. In this regard, <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> has briefed me
                            on the data base which they intend to maintain here in Washington in
                            connection with this project and it looks good. Warm regards.</p>

                        <p>1. Although [garble—instructions?] contained reftel may be subject to
                            different interpretations, I suppose it would be appropriate for me to
                            assume that “authorizations” and “decisions” described therein are still
                            subject to rudimentary reconciliation with the vestigial shreds of Lao
                            sovereignty. Therefore, I will discuss the matter with Souvanna and feel
                            confident I can obtain most of what is desired.</p>
                        <p>2. Before doing so, however, I feel it pertinent to refresh Washington
                            memories on certain aspects of this matter. In particular, I wish to
                            recall that my “suggestion” about the period of “diplomatic curiosity”
                            arose from the fact that the Soviets had protested to Souvanna about
                            U.S. intentions to overfly Laos with B–52s. Our pattern at that time was
                            intended to permit him with honesty to tell the Soviets that B–52s were
                            not overflying Laos, but at the same time, preserve the option of that
                            eventuality when heat was off him.</p>
                        <p>3. I also wish to point out that requirement for [garble—cover?] strikes
                            in Vietnam arose entirely because public relations offices of Strategic
                            Air Command felt it necessary to announce each Arc Light mission
                            executed by their resources. If cover strikes are to be discontinued, I
                            assume I am correct in understanding last sentence of para 5<note n="3" xml:id="d320fn3">The last sentence of paragraph 5 of telegram 76627
                                reads: “You should inform Souvanna that we continue to refuse to
                                discuss details of operations publicly.” (Department of State,
                                Central Files, POL 27 VIET S) In joint State-Defense telegram 78120
                                to Vientiane, December 1, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> was informed that he could tell Souvanna
                                that there will be no public announcements of Arc Light missions in
                                Laos.” (Ibid.)</note> to mean that this public relations policy will
                            also be discontinued and that no announcements will be made concerning
                            Arc Light missions in Laos. Please confirm.</p>
                        <p>4. Paragraph 4 states that “optimum force utilization in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> may require daylight strikes.” As
                            Washington aware, daylight strikes into easternmost areas of Laos have
                            been authorized for some time for those missions entering Lao airspace
                            from the east. The most sensitive feature of this proposed package will
                            be this question of daylight strikes. It therefore may (and probably
                            will) mean that Souvanna's acceptance of daylight strikes in Laos will
                            be predicated on condition that these missions <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0669"/>enter and withdraw from Lao airspace
                            across the eastern frontiers of Laos.</p>
                        <p>5. I will seek appointment with Souvanna soonest and report results.</p>

                        <p>1. In a cable of 27 November 1967 commenting on the air war in Laos,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stated that
                            1) the total of trucks destroyed in Laos in November would in all
                            probability exceed 600, 2) an overwhelming proportion of the truck
                            “kills” had been on Routes 911 and 912 and as a result practically none
                            of the North Vietnamese dry season cargo is reaching as far south as
                            Route 9, and 3) “if this rate of success continues, the entire inventory
                            of trucks which the North Vietnamese hold for the Ho Chi Minh Trail
                            activity will be wiped out before the end of this calendar year.”<note n="2" xml:id="d321fn2">See <ref target="#d319fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 319</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. During November, Seventh Air Force pilots reported 531 trucks
                            destroyed and 198 damaged, the highest monthly rate of destruction
                            reported in Laos during the past two years (see Table 1). Ninety-eight
                            percent of the trucks reported destroyed in Laos during November and 95
                            percent of those reported damaged were found in the Panhandle (Steel
                            Tiger) Area of Laos. The number of trucks reported destroyed in Laos in
                            November has been exceeded in North Vietnam only during the months of
                            July and August 1967 when 603 and 743 respectively were reported
                            destroyed (see Table 2).</p>
                        <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0670"/>
                        <p>3. The record level of reported destruction of trucks in November results
                            from a combination of factors; (1) exceedingly good weather in Laos and
                            the highest number of sorties over Laos since April, (2) the first full
                            month of the dry season and an increase in traffic densities, and (3)
                            possibly poor convoy discipline resulting from the use of inexperienced
                            truck drivers. We know of no change in US tactics or weapons systems
                            that would account for the increased effectiveness of US air
                            attacks.</p>
                        <p>4. We agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that air operations in Laos were especially
                            effective in November. Even allowing for the inflation known to exist in
                            pilot reporting, a continuation of such heavy losses would seriously
                            erode the North Vietnamese truck inventory in Laos and North Vietnam
                            unless imports from the Communist countries increased substantially. It
                            is to be noted, however, that reported truck losses in North Vietnam in
                            November were light, only 50 destroyed and 66 damaged.</p>
                        <p>5. We disagree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s claim that practically no traffic is reaching
                            as far south as Route 9. While road watch teams report little traffic
                            south of Route 9, recent aerial reconnaissance covering the period 4–17
                            November shows that at least 15 percent of the trucks sighted in the
                            Panhandle were operating on Route 9 or south of Route 9. Finally, there
                            are anomalies in the data for November which cannot yet be explained. In
                            November relatively more trucks were destroyed than damaged than in any
                            previous period. In addition, only 6 sorties were required per truck
                            destroyed or damaged compared to 35 sorties per truck destroyed and
                            damaged in November 1966, when about the same number of sorties were
                            flown but only 115 trucks were destroyed.</p>
                        <p>6. We believe that the November experience is heartening but it is still
                            too early to conclude that a major turning point has been reached in the
                            US air interdiction campaign in Southeast Asia. Based on past experience
                            there is considerable doubt that the November performance in Laos can be
                            sustained.</p>

                        <p>3326. 1. Although it is too early and difficult to predict the degree of
                            aggressiveness the NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> enemy will
                            manifest this dry season, indications so far are that we shall probably
                            be in for a rather lively time.</p>
                        <p>2. To the north, immediate pressure on Nam Bac has been relieved but the
                            enemy remain in the area in force and the situation continues to be
                            precarious. There is also a NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            build-up in the vicinity of Site 85. In the south the enemy has made a
                            harassing attack in strength on Lao Ngam during the past two days,
                            withdrawing after inflicting heavy casualties on the friendlies
                            (estimated 42 <gloss target="#t_KIA1">KIA</gloss> and 33 <gloss target="#t_WIA1">WIA</gloss>) as well as destroying supplies, etc.
                            No US personnel were in Lao Ngam at the time. Also in the south, the
                            enemy continues to build up around Saravane and the Bolovens Plateau. We
                            can probably expect more aggressive enemy activity here and there along
                            the perimeter of friendly held territory in Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. Our policy and advice to the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> has been that the loss of such
                            places as Nam Bac and Lao Ngam would be regrettable but these places
                            should not be defended at all costs. Orderly withdrawal is far
                            preferable to a possible significant military defeat. We believe we can
                            effect our policy through our control of military supplies and our
                            general influence on military matters.</p>
                        <p>4. Although the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> has given a fairly
                            good account of itself in the face of enemy pressure at Nam Bac and the
                            FAN similarly at Lao Ngam, experience has shown that when faced with
                            heavy pressure, <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> troops are also
                            capable of panicking. On one such occasion in 1962 (Nam Tha), <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> troops did not stop retreating from the
                            north until they had reached the safety of Thailand across the Mekong.
                            Should <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> troops crack again under
                            pressure, in Nam Bac area or elsewhere, the enemy may well be tempted to
                            press on to more vital objectives. Our estimate is that, with current
                            enemy strength, there is no major threat to vital positions, although
                            the enemy retains the capability of launching attacks to seize
                            temporarily and hold certain positions. We have recently detected,
                            however, through road watch teams in NVN, signs of NVN reinforcements
                            heading towards Laos along Routes 6 and 6 A. The numbers involved are
                            about 3000. For those who are focusing on the war next door this
                            magnitude may seem small; for our little war where friend and foe are
                            evenly matched, the influx of 3000 troops is significant.</p>

                        <p>5. As the Dept will recall, during November 1965 the NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> came close to taking Thakhek on the
                            Mekong. At that time Soviet Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName> became quite uneasy that capture of Thakhek
                            would bring US and Thai retaliation. Soviet pressure may have been
                            instrumental in dissuading the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> from
                            pressing their attack on Thakhek in particular, and the Soviets may also
                            have subsequently discouraged the DRV from launching similar provocative
                            military initiatives in general.</p>
                        <p>6. I am dining with <persName corresp="#p_KBY1">Kirnassovsky</persName>
                            next week, in an effort to forestall NVN attacks, I intend to use that
                            occasion, provided the Dept perceives no objection, to let him know that
                            we know that the NVN are building up, that this build-up continues to
                            violate the Geneva Accords, and that should this build-up threaten the
                            stability of the current political/military situation in Laos, such
                            action would be the cause of grave concern. I would not intend to be
                            drawn out further and would just let him mull it over. Please
                                advise.<note n="2" xml:id="d322fn2">In telegram 86442 to Vientiane,

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary and Conclusions</p>
                        <p>1. Jet aircraft are relatively ineffective against moving targets in
                            Laos. During the first nine months of 1967 jets destroyed or damaged
                                (<gloss target="#t_DD1">D/D</gloss>) only 366 moving vehicles, 1.5
                            per 100 attack sorties, at a cost of $700,000 for each truck or water
                            vessel destroyed or damaged.</p>
                        <p>2. Propeller aircraft are approximately 9 times as effective as jet
                            aircraft per sortie in destroying trucks and water craft in Laos. The
                            prop aircraft destroyed/damaged 996 vehicles, or 12.8 per 100 attack
                            sorties. The cost per vehicle D/D was only $55,000, even though loss
                            rates for propeller aircraft operating in Laos are approximately 4 times
                            greater than the comparable loss rates for jet aircraft.</p>
                        <p>3. Two additional A–1 squadrons could be deployed to Thailand in 1968 and
                            two F4 squadrons returned to the U.S. without reducing the jet sorties
                            available for use in North Vietnam. The A–1 aircraft are expected to
                            destroy or damage an additional 1200 moving vehicles in Laos over a 12
                            month period. This proposal would save about $28 million per year over
                            the current plan for the next 2 years. However, an additional 18
                            aircraft and 8 pilots would be lost under the proposed plan.</p>

                        <p>1. I saw Souvanna this morning and obtained his concurrence in Arc Light
                            overflights of Laos. He stipulated certain conditions and limitations
                            which will be spelled out in following paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>2. On night-time overflights for strikes in Laos, North Vietnam and South
                            Vietnam, he asked that planes be instructed to fly at high altitudes,
                            that they enter Laos on a corridor north of Pakse but south of
                            Savanna-khet and that they avoid overflight of population centers such
                            as Saravane. This would seem to pose no serious problems and my air
                            attaché will be in touch with <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> to
                            work out details.</p>
                        <p>3. On day-time overflights for strikes in NVN and <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> he was a little more skittish and asked whether we
                            could avoid mass formation overflights with ostentatious contrails. I
                            said I would look into this, but undertook no commitments. He did not
                            press it further, so I consider his statement stands in the form of a
                            desideratum rather than a condition. It seems to me that his desideratum
                            would be met if strike missions are flown in cells of three, which I
                            gather is normal practice.</p>
                        <p>4. On daylight strikes in Laos itself, he had problems. He felt that
                            strikes and flights could be easily correlated and he would have hard
                            time justifying Arc Light missions as “reconnaissance activity.” He
                            therefore asked that daylight strikes [on?] Lao soil, when needed, enter
                            and withdraw over eastern frontiers.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment</hi>: I feel this package fulfills essential
                            requirements ref A. As for execution time, he said we could begin
                            tonight if we want. The limitation on routes will add nothing more than
                            a few minutes to any conceivable operation. The limitation on those rare
                            daylight strikes in Laos will add a maximum of about one hour to best
                            conceivable response time and perhaps two hours to entire mission.
                            However, fleeting target situations on Lao soil have been so seldom that
                            this should pose no real burden on our forces.</p>

                        <p> CAP 671165. Laotian Situation Report (as of 6 p.m. EST, 26 December
                            1967).</p>
                        <p>1. Communist forces are keeping up their pressure against government
                            positions in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. An enemy unit, estimated at about battalion strength, raided the
                            government base and airstrip at Muong Phalane on 25 December, and
                            destroyed most of the camp's facilities, including the <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> and Air America buildings. Although
                            government reinforcements apparently have moved into the area, they have
                            not yet reoccupied Muong Phalane.</p>
                        <p>3. Preliminary reports suggest that the attack was specifically aimed
                            against the U.S. presence at Muong Phalane. Two American technicians who
                            manned a navigational station which assists U.S. air operations in
                            southern Laos are missing. The station itself apparently was not
                            damaged.</p>
                        <p>4. The attack on Muong Phalane is the first significant enemy action in
                            this part of the Panhandle in over a year. It may be related to recent
                            attacks farther south in the Bolovens Plateau area. These operations
                            appear to be part of a new Communist campaign to forestall stepped-up
                            allied efforts to interdict the infiltration corridor.</p>
                        <p>5. In northern Laos, the Communists launched a mortar attack on the
                            government airstrip at Nam Bac on 24 December. Continuing reports of a
                            Communist build-up in the vicinity suggest that more ground assaults
                            against Nam Bac's outlying defenses may be in the offing. Government
                            troops are being repositioned in an effort to reduce their
                            vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>6. Although the Communists appear to be putting a little more bite into
                            their dry season offensive this year, there is no evidence that they
                            intend to mount a concerted drive into government-held territory. We
                            agree with the U.S. Embassy's appreciation that the Lao reports out of
                            Vietnam on the status of the North Vietnamese threat are highly
                            exaggerated. In fact, the recent Communist effort against Nam Bac in the
                            north and the Bolovens positions in the south, appears designed to
                            restore the status quo. Until last year, both areas long had been under
                            Pathet Lao control.</p>
                        <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0676"/>
                        <p>7. Nevertheless, we believe that the Communists will make things even
                            hotter in the coming months as they attempt to regain some of the
                            military initiative in Laos. This probably will be particularly true in
                            the Panhandle, where stepped-up allied operations into the infiltration
                            corridor will hit a highly sensitive nerve.</p>

                            as above.<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Findings of the study forwarded by the reference state that the
                            effectiveness of the propeller aircraft in Laos over that of the jet is
                            significant; and, based thereon, it appears possible to substitute two
                            A–1 squadrons for two F–4 squadrons in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>3. On the basis of a review of the study, it appears that use of
                            propeller aircraft against a specific target—trucks—is more effective
                            than the jet type aircraft in the relatively permissive air defense
                            environment of Laos. However, our present force posture in Thailand was
                            based on the fact that these forces would be primarily assigned to
                            targets in North Vietnam (NVN), with Laotian targets as their secondary
                            mission. During good weather periods in NVN the maximum number of
                            Thailand based aircraft is required for strikes in NVN. As a bonus
                            effect, this capability is used to provide a maximum number of sorties
                            in Laos during bad weather periods in NVN. Accordingly, the replacement
                            of two F–4 squadrons by two A–1 squadrons would seriously limit the
                            tactical air capability to prosecute the air campaign against NVN.
                            Specifically, the loss of two F–4 squadrons would result in an
                            approximate 16 percent loss to the current <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> Combat Sortie Program for Thailand based
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>4. A preliminary review by the Joint Staff indicates that a number of
                            factors, essential to a thorough and objective analysis of the
                            effectiveness of propeller versus jet aircraft in Laos, may not have
                            been fully considered <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0678"/>in the
                            study. Some of there essential factors are listed below and discussed in
                            the appendices.</p>
                        <p>a. Type mission scheduled (Appendix A).<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3">In
                                Appendix A, the Joint Staff stated that one of the “key factors” was
                                consideration of primary mission for which the study gave no
                                consideration. Over 75 percent of the sorties of propeller driven
                                aircraft were armed reconnaissance, while only 33 percent of the jet
                                sorties comprised that type of mission. Armed reconnaissance
                                presented the best opportunities for truck destruction. The jet
                                sorties were targeted 67 percent of the time against interdiction
                                points, structures, truck parts, assembly centers, and other targets
                                that rarely produced confirmed truck kills. The Joint Staff argued
                                that the figure of 9 times more effective was wrong and should be
                                3.5 times if only armed reconnaissance missions were compared. In a
                                period of good weather, the figure dropped to less than 2 times as
                                effective.</note>

                                improve effectiveness of both jet and propeller aircraft. The North
                                Vietnamese would therefore improve their air defenses and the slower
                                moving propeller aircraft would become more vulnerable.</note>

                                Appendix E, the Joint Staff stated that as air defenses improved in
                                Laos (2000 percent since 1965), losses of propeller aircraft doubled

                        <p>5. The conclusions drawn in the referenced study are, in some cases,
                            based on highly questionable assumptions. Two examples are cited: a.
                            since there was no bomb damage assessment made on the majority of over
                            2,400 night/weather radar controlled level bombing sorties conducted by
                            jet aircraft during the period of the study, the study assumes that
                            there was no destruction of the targets attacked; and, b. the study
                            assumes loss ratios will remain the same in the face of increased enemy
                            defenses and the recent rising trend of propeller aircraft losses in
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>6. In summary, the study is too narrow in scope to form the firm basis
                            for a decision to exchange two A–1 squadrons for two F–4 squadrons in
                            Thailand. A more comprehensive study of propeller versus jet aircraft in
                            the overall context of Southeast Asia operations is underway. It is
                            therefore requested that the suspense date for the submission of
                            recommendations on this matter be extended to 1 March 1968 in order to

                        <p>211948Z. The situation in Laos. In view of the recent developments in the
                            Ban Nam Bac area of Laos<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">In telegram 3907
                                from Vientiane, January 18, the Embassy reported that “the Lao seem
                                to be keeping their 'sang froid'” over the fall of Nam Bac, a major
                                military defeat by the North Vietnamese/Pathet Lao. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> and current considerations
                            concerning the Laos Panhandle, I am forwarding our assessment of the
                            situation in both of these areas.</p>
                        <p>We view the increase in tempo and intensity of enemy activity in northern
                            Laos as a kick-off of the dry season activities in that area. While
                            serious, and a situation that may develop further, at this point it is
                            not believed to be a general offensive any more than in past dry
                            seasons. The results of the enemy attack on Ban Nam Bac will probably
                            encourage further attempts at offensives in the area. The current
                            emphasis on enemy offensives in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> may
                            explain some of the increase in activity in northern Laos. Guidance and
                            direction for such offensives undoubtedly originate in Hanoi and are
                            intended for areas of active conflict. Considering <pb n="648" xml:id="pg_648" facs="0680"/>the Communist forces presently
                            available in northern Laos, and the currently reflected performance of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> forces in this area, NVN has the
                            capability of reinforcing with one division, moving into the Luang
                            Prabang area and sufficiently controlling the situation to permit a
                            Communist take over of most of northern Laos. This probably is not their
                            intention but the capability is there and the situation appears to
                            present few obstacles should the NVN decide to move in force.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the Laos Panhandle area, US/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ground operations in this area, over an extended
                            period, could restrict enemy resupply activities and movement of
                            replacement personnel, destroy his supply caches, and deny him the base
                            areas/sanctuaries he needs. In such a circumstance, the enemy would be
                            expected initially to divert infiltration activities further to the
                            west, and attempt to increase his use of sea infiltration to include use
                            of Cambodian ports and overland route. He could consider our blocking of
                            his infiltration/logistical effort of sufficient import to divert forces
                            from other operational areas and, if necessary, provide additional
                            forces from NVN. He may act to intensify the threat in northern Laos
                            thereby causing <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and other friendly
                            Lao forces currently in the Panhandle to be diverted to assist in the
                            north and thus further expand the war in the north. It is improbable
                            that the enemy would attempt a complete take over of northern Laos as a
                            reaction to US/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> ground operations
                            in the Laos Panhandle area, but, with encouragement and material support
                            from China, he might attempt to extend presently held territory in
                            northern Laos to a much greater degree.</p>
                        <p>In summary, we see the current northern Laos picture as a successful
                            enemy launching of his dry season offensive with limited objectives
                            around the Nam Bac area. The situation is serious but it is not believed
                            that the enemy intends to attempt a complete take over of this entire
                            area. US/<gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> operations in the Laos
                            Panhandle area could create a serious resupply and personnel replacement
                            problem for the enemy. The enemy would be expected to divert to the west
                            and increase his other available means of infiltration. Should our
                            operation be of a magnitude which would result in an unacceptable
                            curtailment of the enemy infiltration effort, he probably would, in an
                            attempt to regain full control of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, reinforce with
                            troops from the north, and may intensify his threat to the northern Laos
                            area.</p>

                        <p>I talked with Bill Sullivan on Saturday, January 20. He explained he
                            thought we would be better off if the bombing [of North Vietnam] were
                            stopped in May, rather than now, since in Laos that was the beginning of
                            the rainy season which lasts until the autumn. The North Vietnamese
                            trucks get bogged down in Laos during this period and the roads are
                            unusable.</p>
                        <p>From Bill Sullivan's standpoint, this idea has two values:</p>
                        <p>(1) It automatically contributes to taking “no advantage” in Laos.</p>
                        <p>(2) He is afraid if the bombing is stopped in the North during the dry
                            season, there will be a marked increase in bombing in Laos. This might
                            have adverse repercussions in our relations with <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> as well as make
                            Souvanna's position of “neutrality” more difficult with Soviets and

                        <p>Summary: The defeat of the Lao Armed Forces (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>) at Nam Bac has wiped out the government's effort over
                            a two-year period to link up its first and second military regions in a
                            meaningful manner at the Nam (River) Hou and to expand its influence
                            westward in the direction of Muong Sai and to the northwest to Nam Tha.
                            By eliminating the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> salient at Nam
                            Bac the enemy has put himself in a better position to harass Luang
                            Prabang and its environs and to disrupt pro-government guerrilla

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The most recent reports of enemy action around Site-85 (Phou Pha Thi)
                            indicate that an attempt to seize the site is imminent. Two key outposts
                            defending the approaches to Site-85 have already been taken by the North
                            Vietnamese and pressure is continuing to close in around the site.</p>
                        <p>2. Over a year ago when Vang Pao attempted to defend Site-36 (Na Khang),
                            his troops suffered a great number of casualties. At that point he
                            decided never again to commit his units to the all-out defense of a
                            position. That tactic is still being followed and, while his units will
                            continue to defend Site-85 as long as possible, he does not intend to
                            accept heavy casualties in exchange for real estate.</p>
                        <p>3. As you know, the TSQ 81,<note n="2" xml:id="d330fn2"> TSQ 81 was the
                                mobile version of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> 77.</note> as
                            well as a <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> facility, is located
                            at Site-85. When the decision was made to install these facilities it
                            was understood that no last ditch stand would be made to defend them.
                            Although this equipment is costly, it is expendable—the men who service
                            it are not and they will be removed prior to the fall of the site, if
                            the situation becomes hopeless.</p>

                        <p>During an hour and a half's luncheon conversation the following point was

                        <p>The Secretary said that our recent information showed that there were
                            North Vietnamese battalions around the town of Saravane in southern Laos
                            and that if, as was possible, the North Vietnamese launched an attack on
                            the city, the U.S. would become militarily involved. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> made a note of the name
                            Saravane, obviously for the purpose of informing Moscow. The Secretary
                            said that he thought the U.K. and the Soviet Union as co-chairmen of the
                            1962 Laos arrangement had certain duties, pointing out to <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> that this agreement had been
                            made quite independently of events in Viet-Nam. <persName corresp="#p_DAF1">Dobrynin</persName> agreed.</p>

                            Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, be “dedicated” to Laos. In view of the
                            increasing enemy pressure in Laos, and the important but fleeting
                            opportunities there to inflict damage on the enemy, we think <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s request should be strongly
                            supported.</p>
                        <p>The over-all counter-insurgency mission in Laos is to harness in an
                            efficient manner three elements—Lao irregulars; perishable, all-source
                            intelligence; and air power—in order to inflict the greatest damage
                            possible on enemy personnel and logistical facilities. Operations have
                            been highly successful when all these elements are present.</p>
                        <p>With the priority attention of the 56th <gloss target="#t_ACW1">ACW</gloss>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> believes he would get the number of daily
                            sorties he needs: (a) nine A–26 sorties, (b) eight T–28 sorties, (c)
                            eighteen A–1 sorties. In addition, U–10s and C–123s would be regularly

                            <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> would use this air

                            into hostile areas, attacking enemy positions, or defending base

                            and discussing possible “surprises” which the future might hold.

                            impressions in a February 24 memorandum to the President. Part of the

                        <p>“Recent enemy activity in Laos can hardly be termed an offensive since
                            all movements have been to regain terrain which the communists have
                            claimed since 1962. The areas attacked had been taken over by Laotian
                            government forces in 1966 or 1967 so that the Pathet Lao probably feel
                            that they are merely reclaiming lost property. However, the Pathet Lao
                            supported by North Vietnamese troops are capable of moving almost
                            anywhere in Laos and could use this superiority at any time to score a
                            victory in concert with successes, real or claimed, in South

                        </list>
                        <p>1. The Issue. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            is not asking that any air resources be assigned for use in Laos. He is
                            asking for much less. Although <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0687"/>he has excellent working relations with Seventh Air Force, he believes
                            they generally give him tactical air strike support for targets in Laos
                            only after requirements in Vietnam are satisfied. In asking that the
                            56th Air Commando Wing (<gloss target="#t_ACW1">ACW</gloss>) at Nakhon
                            Phanom, Thailand, be “dedicated” to Laos, he is not trying to break the
                            general rule that the Air Force needs flexibility in assigning its
                            aircraft. All he wants is a “first call” on some planes. In view of the
                            increasing enemy pressure in Laos, and the important but fleeting
                            opportunities there to inflict damage on the enemy, we think <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s request should be strongly
                            supported.</p>
                        <p>2. U.S. Interest. Although the US has no formal commitment to defend
                            Laos, we have a keen political-military interest in preserving its
                            independence as a buffer to protect the Mekong lowlands bordering
                            Thailand. The current enemy dry-season offensive, hitting from north to
                            south, is beginning to crumble the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>'s
                            ability to defend itself, and North Vietnamese/Pathet Lao troops are
                            pressing ever nearer the heavily populated areas along the river.
                            However, Sullivan's request is not keyed to any emergency. He is
                            bringing up a long-standing problem because it is more acute now; but
                            the problem has existed for some time.</p>
                        <p>3. A rule of thumb used to be that we were supporting <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> operations in the North in order to
                            have a fairly free hand in the Panhandle, where our air operations were
                            largely related to the war in Vietnam. This is less true today. The
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> urgently needs our support also
                            in the South. The Lao have not so far expressed any dissatisfaction with
                            US air support, but this is due to the fact that they do not know
                            everything we are doing, or could do, in the Panhandle. The fact is that
                            effective operations in the Panhandle serve also the security of the
                            neighboring countries. Besides, those operations are very productive in
                            terms of trucks destroyed and North Vietnamese killed (some 7,500 to
                            8,000 NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> killed annually in all of
                            Laos, the majority through air power).</p>
                        <p>4. Needs: With the priority attention of the 56th <gloss target="#t_ACW1">ACW</gloss>, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> believes he would get the number of daily
                            sorties he needs: (a) nine A–26 sorties, (b) eight T–28 sorties, (c)
                            eighteen A–1 sorties. In addition, U–10s and C–123s would be regularly
                            available for Forward Air Control (<gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>)
                            and flare ship roles. He is asking for prop planes, not jets. We do not
                            know exactly how much he is getting now, but he is getting substantially
                            less than the sorties he says he needs. “Dedication” of a specific 7th
                            AF unit seems to be less important than getting some kind of assurance
                            that <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> will get the number
                            of missions specified above.</p>
                        <p>5. Mission. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has stated
                            the priorities for which tactical air is needed: (a) hitting fleeting
                            targets identified on motorable roads; (b) enemy logistical facilities
                            and troop concentrations; (c) support for irregulars who are being
                            infiltrated into hostile areas, attacking enemy positions, or defending
                            base areas. The last-mentioned point is the most politically important
                            one in Laos, and perhaps the least appreciated by <pb n="656" xml:id="pg_656" facs="0688"/>the military: The counter-insurgency
                            mission in Laos may be small potatoes to 7th AF, but upon it depends the
                            morale of tribal elements (half the total population) and also, in the
                            last analysis, of the entire <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>.
                            Counter-insurgency missions have been highly successful when all three
                            key elements (Lao irregulars, perishable all-source intelligence, and
                            air power) have been present. Without one of these elements, they
                            fail.</p>
                        <p>6. The Larger Context. Although <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> is immediately concerned about protecting Site
                            85, where we have the TSQ–81 and a <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss>, the lack of sufficient air strike assets for Laos
                            has been flagged by him repeatedly, including in his periodic
                            discussions with the Joint Chiefs, since 1965. He has been proven right
                            in his “Sopwith Camel” approach—that propeller-driven craft are superior
                            to jets in the Laos situation. He has also stressed the importance of
                            hitting NVN traffic as far north in the trail structure as possible
                            (i.e., in the vicinity of Mu Gia) before it disperses under jungle
                            canopy further south. We are, and he is, not taking a parochial Laos
                            point of view: “Dedicating” air assets to Laos will improve also our
                            posture in South Vietnam as well as Thailand. Also, we are not
                            adjudicating a dispute. It is merely a question of upping the priority
                            slightly in one country, in the interests of our position on that
                            country and in the interests of the overall war effort.</p>

                            reported to the Secretary of State that he was receiving insufficient
                            air support to attack key targets in Laos (reference 1a).</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Concurrently, the Ambassador
                            voiced his reservations to the Commander, 7th Air Force and recommended
                            that the 56th Air Commando Wing (Nakhon Phanom) be “dedicated” to the
                            air support of targets in Laos (reference 1b).</p>

                            responded and stated his acknowledgment of the requirement for air
                            support as indicated by the Ambassador. He cited some of the current
                            requirements on his resources and indicated that some of the current
                            problems may soon be alleviated by the arrival of additional A–1s
                            (reference 1c).</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) After additional review,
                            Commander, 7th Air Force further responded to the reiterated request for
                            assignment of a specific unit to Laos air support, with a firm judgment
                            that he could not reduce the flexibility of his force by dedicating a
                            portion to a specific area/mission. The Commander, 7th Air Force stated
                            his goal of meeting all requirements contingent on priorities and force
                            availability. He assured Ambassador, Vientiane that the necessary
                            sorties would be flown in Laos to meet critical situations (reference
                            1e).</p>

                            responded by restating his request for “dedication” of the 56th Air
                            Commando Wing and acknowledgment of the obligation of 7th Air Force to
                            place first priority on strikes in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.
                            Additionally the Ambassador indicated that he was repeating his
                            “dedication” proposal to Washington (Secretary of State) in hopes that
                            authorities there would relieve 7th Air Force of some of its priority
                            obligation in other areas (reference 1d).</p>
                        <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The proposal of Commander, 7th Air
                            Force to satisfy requirements is valid and retains flexibility in the

                        </list>
                        <p>This is in response to your request for information on the significance
                            of Phou Pha Thi.</p>
                        <p>Equipment. Phou Pha Thi is the site of a very important US
                            radar-navigational station for supporting US air operations in North
                            Vietnam and northern Laos. Equipment installed at the site are:</p>
                        <p> TSQ–81—a portable version of the <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77—an extremely sophisticated radar-navigational device
                            used by US bombers for precision-bombing of targets in North Vietnam
                            north of Vinh at night and in inclement weather. It has an effective
                            range of about 200 miles (see map for area covered in North
                                Vietnam).<note n="2" xml:id="d336fn2">Not printed.</note> Installed
                            on November 1, 1967, it is the only device of its kind in Laos. Two
                                <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77's are installed in Thailand,
                            and two in South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss>—a navigational aid which emits
                            beams to help orient US aircraft operating primarily in northern Laos.
                            It was installed about a year ago. There are three other <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> sites in Laos, the nearest one to
                            Phou Pha Thi being at Long Tien, south of the Plain of Jars (see
                            map).</p>
                        <p> US Personnel. At any one time, there are 15 Americans stationed at the
                            site: 12 to service the TSQ–81, two to service the TACAN, and one
                            presumably to oversee the operation. As at the other <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> sites in Laos, these individuals
                            are <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> personnel, formally converted
                            to civilian status as Lockheed employees for the duration of their tour
                            of duty in Laos. There are three teams based on Udorn, each serving a
                            five-day shift. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> has authorized the stationing of US personnel at
                            the <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> sites, but he has not been
                            told about the TSQ–81 at Phou Pha Thi.</p>
                        <p>Guerrilla Base. Pho Pha Thi, which is situated only 25 miles from Sam
                            Neua town, has also served for some time as a major base for guerrilla
                            operations. At present, about 700 Meo irregulars are based there to
                            carry out forays into enemy territory as well as to man a defensive
                            perimeter with a radius of about 12 miles. This perimeter has been
                            breached during the past week.</p>
                        <p>Enemy Threat. The enemy is undoubtedly aware of the importance of the
                            site as a radar-navigational installation and of the US presence there.
                                <pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0691"/>The site was bombed
                            unsuccessfully by North Vietnamese aircraft on January 12.<note n="3" xml:id="d336fn3">The attack was by two Soviet-manufactured Colt
                                (AN–2) single engine biplanes, which bombed the site at 1:20 in the
                                afternoon. The aircraft dropped 15 bombs of 250 lbs. wounding three
                                Lao soldiers and one U.S. technician. The bombing resulted in slight
                                damage to the <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss> antenna and
                                temporarily closed it down. The TSQ–81 continued to operate. Both
                                planes were lost after the raid. One crashed into a ridge after
                                being hit by small arms fire from the ground, and the other was shot
                                down by a sharpshooter with a rifle from an airborne Air America
                                helicopter. (Telegram 3779 from Vientiane, January 12; Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note> Since then, the enemy has
                            been completing elaborate preparations, including the building of roads,
                            to make a ground assault upon the site. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> believes that this will take
                            place within two weeks. We believe that should enemy artillery come
                            within range of the 600-foot airstrip, it would become extremely
                            difficult to extricate the small US unit as well as the 700-man Laotian
                            force.</p>

                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Air strike forces in Southeast
                            Asia require a mix of types of aircraft to perform with optimum
                            effectiveness in both the unsophisticated air defense environment found
                            in Laos and South Vietnam and the heavily defended area of North
                            Vietnam. Reduction of the flow of materials to South Vietnam is more
                            effectively achieved by striking as close to the source as possible. It
                            is, of course, essential to keep these materials under attack throughout
                            the infiltration system. Whenever the choice exists, however, the
                            primary emphasis must be to stop or destroy this <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0692"/>equipment before it is dispersed
                            throughout the maze of highways, roads, and trails in North Vietnam and
                            Laos. To attack at the source requires a force that can operate in the
                            highly defended areas of Hanoi and Haiphong at maximum strength.
                            Specialized forces, which can survive only in relatively undefended
                            areas, should be in addition to, not as a substitute for, the force
                            capable of striking the source. Any reduction of the existing F–4 force
                            in Southeast Asia would materially limit the ability to strike the
                            supply source. Therefore, the total mission objective in Southeast Asia
                            should be considered when structuring the force mix to optimize
                            capabilities in the different defense environments.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Both the <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> study and the 18 December 1967 7th Air Force
                            “Comparative Analysis of Propeller vs Jet Aircraft”<note n="3" xml:id="d337fn3">See the enclosure to <ref target="#d323">Document
                                    323</ref>.</note> are addressed to a comparison of propeller
                            aircraft and jet aircraft. However, a more proper comparison is between
                            low and high wing-loaded aircraft. Low wing-loaded jet aircraft such as
                            the B–57 and A–37 have performance characteristics more closely aligned
                            with the low-level/permissive environment capabilities of the A–1, A–26,
                            and T–28 than with the characteristics of the F–4 and F–105. In further
                            discussion in this paper, this comparison is made instead of the more
                            simple but less correct comparison between propeller and jet aircraft.
                            An analysis of the relative effectiveness of low wing-loaded versus high
                            wing-loaded aircraft operations against trucks in Laos should consider:
                            (a) general aircraft capabilities (Appendix A); (b) type mission
                            executed (Appendix B); (c) amount of effort which is applied against
                            trucks (Appendix A); and (d) a comparison of aircraft vulnerability
                            within its area of operations (Appendix C). Comments on these factors
                            are included in the Appendices hereto.<note n="4" xml:id="d337fn4">The
                                appendices are attached, but not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) With respect to improvements,
                            maximum use is being made of road watch teams, electronic sensors, and
                            night observation devices, i.e., Starlight Scope, side-looking infrared
                            radar, and low light-level television, to improve the probability of
                            detecting vehicles, waterborne craft, and personnel. The development of
                            a suitable anti-vehicle mine and improved area ordnance for
                            high-performance jet aircraft is receiving priority attention. Gunship
                            II should further contribute to this program.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The requirement for a balanced
                            force mix in Southeast Asia and additional considerations contained in
                            the Appendices support the following conclusions:</p>
                        <p>a. Low wing-loaded aircraft also have demonstrated high effectiveness in
                            the night route interdiction mission in a relatively permissive <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0693"/>defense environment. However,
                            employment in highly defended areas is precluded because of
                            vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>b. High wing-loaded aircraft provide an excellent capability against the
                            total Southeast Asia environment. If these aircraft were assigned the
                            primary task of truck interdiction, their relative effectiveness against
                            this target element would improve. However, the existing F–4 force is
                            the minimum required to accomplish effectively the overall mission. Any
                            reduction or diversion of this force would proportionately reduce the
                            capability that can be applied against the most critical points of the
                            enemy's supply distribution system: Hanoi and Haiphong.</p>
                        <p>c. The interdiction effort in Laos is a team effort. The extensive
                            daylight jet strikes against truck parks, transfer points, roads, and
                            supply depots force enemy trucks to travel almost exclusively at night.
                            This has improved the target opportunity and, consequently, the
                            effectiveness of night operations of low wing-loaded aircraft. This
                            balanced approach to interdiction would be adversely affected by
                            substitution of A–1 for F–4 squadrons. Therefore, the aircraft approved
                            for deployment in Program 5 should be additive to, not a substitution
                            for, F–4 assets in Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Based on these conclusions, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that the proposed substitution of A–1
                            for F–4 squadrons suggested in the <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss>

                        <p> MAC 02985. 1. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The situation in Laos
                            is rapidly becoming critical. Attopeu and Saravane may fall as well as
                            the Bolovens Plateau. Pakse is threatened which would allow the enemy
                            egress to the Mekong. <persName corresp="#p_HCM1">Ho Chi Minh</persName>
                            is taking steps that bear out his design on all <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) It is time to consider a strategy
                            that is broad enough to counter the total threat of NVN to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan 6<note n="2" xml:id="d338fn2">

                            operations that can be refined to meet the current exigencies.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Some of the advantages of this
                            approach are:</p>
                        <p>A. NVN would be countered under international aegis. This could have a
                            broad psychological impact.</p>
                        <p>B. Greater options would be available in the battle for <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. The <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> powers would be
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>D. The President would have a broader basis for his policies.</p>
                        <p>E. It would permit US forces to enter Laos under international colors by
                            request of Laotian Govt.</p>
                        <p>F. Cambodia would be isolated and <persName corresp="#p_SPN1">Sihanouk</persName> may give support to <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Disadvantages are:</p>
                        <p>A. Broadens war and US commitment to <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. Partial mobilization of both personnel and industry would probably be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>C. Possibility of strong public reaction in the US.</p>
                        <p>D. Possibility ChiCom intervention.</p>
                        <p>E. Time involved.</p>
                        <p>F. Combined staff will compound command and control problems.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Specifically, US/<gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> field forces at the request of the
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> could go through Thailand to
                            seize key areas in Laos such as the Bolovens Plateau. Aggressive action
                            could be taken along the road and trail complex to disrupt the flow of
                                <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> troops and supplies. I feel that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> would be
                            amenable to the implementation of a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Plan or a similar plan sponsored by another
                            international group.</p>
                        <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Although there are practical
                            problems and foreseeable difficulties in an attempt to use the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> organization, I feel the situation
                            is <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0695"/>such that this course of
                            action should be seriously considered. Our approach should be to back an
                            international group with the purpose of saving <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> as opposed to unilateral action to save a weak <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> Government. <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> was originated for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>7. This concept was discussed by me with Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName> on 2 March. His political staff has it under
                            study. It will be debated at the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting on 7 March.<note n="3" xml:id="d338fn3">See the attachment to <ref target="#d345">Document

                        <p>5021. 1. I discovered, in recent <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting,<note n="2" xml:id="d339fn2">March 7; see
                                attachment to <ref target="#d345">Document 345</ref>.</note> that
                            there is not a clear understanding in all quarters of relationship which
                            Souvanna sees between recent enemy military activity in south Laos and
                            potential introduction of U.S. forces into Lao Panhandle. There was some
                            disposition to assume that, because North Vietnamese not only clearly
                            violating Lao territory, but also threatening population centers,
                            Souvanna would have less objection to U.S. forces coming into Panhandle
                            at this time.</p>
                        <p>2. This assessment overlooks the shrewd and ruthless blackmail factor
                            which has been a deliberate element of recent enemy activity in South
                            Laos. This element has manifested itself by the enemy tactic of
                            surrounding such significant population centers as Saravane and Attopeu,
                            making obvious their clear capacity to take and destroy these exposed
                            salients of governmental control. At the same time, their allies, such
                            as Soviets and Poles, busily pass word that these centers will not be
                            taken because they were not in Pathet Lao hands in 1962.</p>
                        <p>3. Patent implication of these statements is that enemy will respect
                            government control over these cities provided no intrusion made into
                            areas of their control. In shorthand, introduction of U.S. troops across
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>-Laos border would mean <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> loss of Saravane and Attopeu.</p>
                        <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>4. Therefore, from Souvanna's viewpoint, a putative U.S. request to
                            introduce ground forces into territory which he does not control to
                            fight enemy which he doubts U.S. can fix and destroy would have to be
                            balanced against permanent loss and probable destruction of two cities
                            currently under his control which he has no doubt enemy could take at
                            will.</p>
                        <p>5. Ergo, current enemy pressures in South Laos have not weakened
                            Souvanna's resolve to resist introduction of U.S. forces into Panhandle,
                            but rather have been deliberately and rather cleverly designed to
                            enhance that resolve.</p>
                        <p>6. I do not wish suggest from foregoing that blackmail against these two
                            cities is only issue which keeps Souvanna from welcoming U.S. ground
                            force intervention in Laos. As Dept is aware, his objections to such
                            intervention are based upon many considerations of long standing and
                            reasoned convictions. However, I believe it is important to place a
                            proper perspective on the relationship between current crises and
                            prevailing convictions.</p>

                        <p>1. Since 25 February 1968, when FOV 13,429 (TDCSDB– 315/00669–68)<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">Not further identified.</note> was prepared
                            to appraise the security of the guerrilla base at Phou Pha Thi (UH
                            6663–6860), the enemy has methodically continued to prepare the
                            battlefield for his attack on the summit of Phou Pha Thi. In a series of
                            penetrations of the 12-kilometer defensive perimeter around Phou Pha Thi
                            the enemy has focused primarily on bringing more troops into the area
                            and in so doing to consolidate his breach of the perimeter. As of 9
                            March the enemy has a total estimated force equivalent to seven
                            battalions that could be brought to bear in a ground attack on site 85.
                            In effect, in the period 25 February to 9 March the enemy has expanded
                            his hold on Phou Den Din (UH 790595), has consolidated his position on
                            the ridge line running west from Phou Houei Hao (UH 735583), and has
                            extended the depth of his probes up toward the base of Phou Pha Thi and
                            has thus penetrated deeper into the 12-kilometer defensive perimeter so
                            that by 7 March 150 enemy troops had clashed with a guerrilla patrol in
                            the vicinity of UH 725581, only about five kilometers from the base of
                            the mountain.</p>

                        <p>5038. 1. As Dept has probably learned from military sources, enemy has
                            effectively eliminated air navigation facilities at Site 85. Action
                            began yesterday evening with artillery and mortar shelling. Decision to
                            destroy facilities by self-destruction was taken in small hours of
                            morning. Helicopter evacuation was arranged for first light this
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>2. Evacuation plans have been seriously disrupted by enemy activity and
                            several [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] personnel have <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0698"/>apparently been dispersed from pre-planned evacuation
                            sites. Although seven of them have been accounted for as of this time,
                            eleven are yet to be located. Of those seven accounted for, three are
                            dead on the site, one died in the helicopter en route and three are at
                            Udorn.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition to these personnel, two <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and one <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss> forward
                            air controller have been withdrawn from their evacuation sites. Other
                            local personnel (wounded, etc.) have also been extracted.</p>
                        <p>4. Fighting and shelling continues, as well as helicopter and ground
                            evacuation efforts. Because of confused situation at site and withdrawal
                            our <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> personnel (one of whom was
                            wounded) it will doubtless be some time before we have clear picture or
                            further significant reports.</p>
                        <p>5. We will, of course, continue reports as information comes in. At first
                            glance, however, it appears we may have pushed our luck one day too long
                            in attempting to keep this facility in operation.</p>

                        <p>1. Evacuation operations at Site 85 have been completed and site is
                            currently in enemy hands. Personnel from mountain-top positions have
                            been extracted by helicopter with exception relatively small group SGU
                            local troops who have descended to base camp positions, joined other
                            units there, and are withdrawing overland to previously agreed safe
                            havens. Since we may assume that these safe havens will also come under
                            enemy pressure soon, there may be required a second phase of withdrawals
                            for these latter personnel.</p>
                        <p>2. Final count on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] personnel accounts for all but three. One of
                            these may subsequently be listed as <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0699"/>dead if and when we can get more coherent information
                            from survivors, some of whom in state of considerable shock.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">In telegram 5103 from Vientiane, March 12,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> reported that
                                there would be a search and rescue operation for personnel still
                                unaccounted for, the remaining structures at Site 85 would be
                                destroyed by napalm bombs dropped from U.S. aircraft, no publicity
                                would be given to the battle, Souvanna would be informed, and the
                                next of kin would be notified in the United States. (Ibid.) In
                                telegrams 5119 from Vientiane, March 13, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> reported that he informed Souvanna of the
                                capture of Site 85. <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                                also reported that 11 U.S. personnel were killed; the 3 previously
                                unaccounted for were killed according to the survivors.
                                (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Contrary to figures cited reftel, there was total of 16 of these
                            personnel at communications site, rather than 18 as we had earlier
                            understood. Of these 16, five were extracted alive but one was killed in
                            helicopter when he was hit by ground fire. Eight others are known dead.
                            Three are unaccounted for, although one of these, as stated above, may
                            be presumed dead.</p>
                        <p>4. Confusion surrounding extraction these personnel stems from two
                            factors not yet fully explained. First was fact that these personnel,
                            instead of assembling at pre-arranged evacuation site, decide to climb
                            down over face of sheer cliffs to a narrow ledge, using some sort of
                            cargo harness system which they devised for this purpose. It is not
                            known why or when they decided to take this action. But it is presumed
                            that they must have thought, contrary to fact, that trail to evacuation
                            site was blocked.</p>
                        <p>5. Second was fact that small enemy “suicide squad”, which seems to have
                            made improbable ascent up these same cliffs, surprised and caught these
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] personnel on their narrow ledge, gunning and
                            grenading them while they were trapped in this inescapable position. It
                            was here that these men suffered such heavy casualties and where most of
                            them are reported to have died. Three bodies were subsequently seen on
                            this ledge, but remainder are assumed to have fallen off sheer 2000 foot
                            drop.</p>
                        <p>6. We and Air Force personnel at Udorn will attempt reconstruct story
                            further from survivors when latter have recovered from sedation and
                            shock. Conclusion, however, seems quite definitive that none of missing
                            personnel are likely to be alive.</p>
                        <p>7. For this reason, <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> late yesterday
                            afternoon flew several missions against remains of navigation and
                            communications equipment on mountain top, as well as abandoned artillery
                            position, in order destroy materiel left behind. Photo missions are
                            being run today to determine whether further strikes are necessary.</p>

                        <p>8. Several follow-up actions remain to be accomplished, and will be
                            subject of meeting this afternoon between Ambassador and DEPCOM 7/13
                            AF.</p>
                        <p>A. We must discuss with <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> and determine
                            what, if anything, needs to be said about this action. It remains to be
                            seen whether Hanoi or Pathet Lao radios will announce their victory.</p>
                        <p>B. We must decide how to handle next of kin notification, casualty
                            announcements, etc.</p>
                        <p>C. We must expedite action for replacement site, at least for <gloss target="#t_TACAN1">TACAN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>D. We should discuss possibility that Site 36 will be next on enemy list

                        <p>1. Fall of Pha Thi (Site 85) in Sam Neua Province opens a new time of
                            troubles for <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> and the Meos
                            of Military Region II. The size of the attacking forces and their heavy
                            supporting weapons are greater than anything friendly troops can muster
                            in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, there is no alternative but to
                            evacuate friendly troop units and their dependents in order maintain
                            them intact for counterattack activity in rainy season. Ref A indicates
                            dimension of refugee problem with which we are attempting to cope. A
                            fleet of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft is engaged in this effort
                            today.</p>
                        <p>2. It should be borne in mind that North Vietnam mounted attack of this
                            size and intensity because it wished eliminate U.S. installation, which
                            had become “attractive nuisance” for them. Consequently, this vast
                            uprooting of human resources and abandonment of useful territory is
                            direct result U.S., rather than <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>,
                            operational interests.</p>
                        <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0701"/>
                        <p>3. Site 36, which is used as forward launch base for <gloss target="#t_ARS1">ARS</gloss> helicopters, is another U.S.-dedicated
                            activity which will doubtless also attract enemy attention. Although it
                            is more heavily defended than Site 85, it is questionable whether it can
                            withstand a determined assault by seven NVN battalions, the strength we
                            feel enemy is probably able to deploy against it.</p>
                        <p>4. Faced with these prospects, <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang
                                Pao</persName> has sent message to Prime Minister Souvanna and to me
                            asking for maximum air strikes against a series of targets in Military
                            Region II. Most of the targets are in or lie close to towns and other
                            centers of civilian population which Prime Minister has previously asked
                            us to avoid. I went over list with Souvanna yesterday and we agreed to
                            have U.S. photo-interpreters examine prospects for carefully controlled
                            strikes against a number of <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang
                                Pao</persName>'s targets. We agreed to take joint look at
                            photography as soon as my people can get target folders assembled.</p>
                        <p>5. Last evening subsequent to discussions reported para 4, Souvanna told
                            me he had received disturbing message from <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> which he interpreted as preparation for
                            withdrawal from additional forward territory in Region II, raising
                            prospect that north and east defenses of Vientiane plains would be
                            significantly reduced in depth. Souvanna felt this was imprudent and
                            hoped to dissuade <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> from
                            any such steps. He felt he needed assurances of air strikes as persuader
                            for <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> and again urged early
                            meeting on subject.</p>

                            misunderstood his message. He reportedly was referring merely to
                            location of new refugee centers rather than relocation of old. Of some
                            possible interest to Embassy Bangkok was his thought of placing some of

                            province in Thailand.</p>

                        <p>5187. 1. As we enter last few weeks of dry season without visible
                            reduction North Vietnamese presence or activities, Lao are bracing
                            themselves for another series of enemy attacks. This time there is
                            somewhat less sense of panic than in February and a more careful
                            measuring of circumstances. However, there is also an underlying worry
                            and fatalism, which reflects a broad scale of uncertainties. Chief among
                            these are apparent inability of friendly forces in South Vietnam to
                            reassert initiative, especially in countryside and marks of diminishing
                            support for war in United States.</p>
                        <p>2. All senior Lao military were gathered in conferences with Souvanna
                            here in Vientiane for nearly three days of discussion this week. Basic
                            thrust of their discussions concerned reorganization of staff and field
                            commands, but sessions provided best opportunity in my experience here
                            for political and military views to be brought into common focus.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>, who attended all
                            sessions, told Emboff he considered them most professional he has known.
                            Fact that he and <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> (who
                            spent only two days here) were present and active contributors to
                            discussions probably had a lot to do with their realism.</p>
                        <p>3. Interspersed with his meetings with the generals, Souvanna had me in
                            for a half dozen sessions, culminating in a seance yesterday afternoon
                            which brought me, my <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Station Chief and photo-interpreter
                            into conclave with Souvanna and his ten generals. Purpose of this
                            session was to plan expanded bombing campaign against targets in Xieng
                            Khouang and Sam Neua provinces, including several which have been off
                            limits until now. These strikes have been requested by <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>, but I insisted on having
                            Souvanna personally accept responsibility for targeting, so that he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName> and general staff
                            could draw lines distinguishing between legitimate military objectives
                            and civilian population centers.</p>
                        <p>4. As consequence this session, we came up with significant spread of
                            targets which have been passed on to 7th AF. Latter has already advised
                            us of their readiness to react to this request and we assume that air
                            campaign will begin next week, weather permitting.</p>
                        <p>5. In addition requests for air strikes, Souvanna and his generals asked
                            for expedited delivery of certain types equipment, particularly
                            artillery <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0703"/>and crew served
                            weapons. Most of these are already en route, but we have submitted
                            additional requisitions through appropriate channels. Only two items on
                            which I boggled were 106mm. recoilless rifles and tank. Requests for
                            both these items are obviously engendered by reports of enemy tanks and
                            armored vehicles in Lao Ngam area and recent experience with same at Ban
                            Houie Sane. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_VP1">Vang Pao</persName>
                            feels he would like to use 106's against enemy artillery, if he can move
                            guerrilla teams close to their batteries.</p>
                        <p>6. Since I have made negative noises about these two items and since they
                            are not in our <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> program, we could
                            probably finesse this request if we have to. However, if more PR76 or
                            other tanks show up again in Laos, issue is sure to rise once more.
                            Therefore, suggest Dept. take counsel with Defense and advise
                            contingency views for our possible use.</p>

                        <p>1. The Southeast Asia Coordinating Committee (<gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss>) convened at Cam Ranh Bay on
                            March 7. Present were Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BE1">Bunker</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName>, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>, together with their
                            principal advisors. Following represents agreed summary of
                            recommendations:</p>
                        <p>A. Vietnam—1. In light of enemy divisions in <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>-Khe Sanh area, the U.S. Government should study
                            possibility of conducting amphibious feint north of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss> to relieve pressure on I Corps
                            recommended by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>. Study should
                            include careful re-examination of earlier expressed fear that failure to
                            follow though on such a feint might be termed a propaganda victory for
                            North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>B. Laos—The extensive use of Laos by North Vietnamese military forces has
                            greatly increased the problem of combating the enemy throughout South
                            Vietnam. The use of Laotian territory by the enemy has reached a degree
                            of seriousness where, despite the political problems involved, we should
                            consider permitting limited military operations in Laos. Current
                            military situation in Laos is moreover marked by aggressive enemy action
                            which bears direct relation to increased North Vietnamese presence in
                            Northern provinces of South Vietnam. Specially planned operations by US
                            forces on Khe Sanh plateau may encounter harassment and fire from enemy
                            forces across the border in enemy base areas of Laos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> recommends following
                            actions relating to foregoing evaluation:</p>
                        <p>1. Contingency planning for possible limited ground operations by US
                            and/or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> forces in Laos should
                            proceed. The point may be reached when it will become necessary on a
                            case by case basis to put limited ground forces into Laos. In that
                            event, these forces should be employed close to the border and the
                            operations should be conducted in <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0705"/>such a way as to have no press exposure. It is
                            important that the targets selected be worthy of the political risks
                            involved. The Commander, US <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> will
                            prepare contingency plans for consideration by Embassy Vientiane and
                            will forward them to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> for approval. The problems of
                            deniability and/or press disclosure of such operations are recognized,
                            and they will be covered in an appropriate annex.</p>
                        <p>2. Make immediate efforts to locate an alternate position for Site 85,
                            primarily for aircraft guidance purposes. One such site, Phou Bia, would
                            be valuable but requires specialized helicopter support because of
                            altitude. The 7th Air Force will examine possibilities of obtaining such
                            helicopters.</p>
                        <p>3. Authorize launching of Prairie Fire missions through Nakhon Phanom,
                            recovering at forward refueling sites in Laos after team insertion when
                            poor weather prevents operations from South Vietnam. These launches from
                            Nakhon Phanom will be subject to existing restrictions on Vietnamese
                            presence in Thailand and Laos. The Commander of Special Operations
                            Groups (<gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss>) will coordinate with
                            Embassy Vientiane re operating arc of current helicopters from Nakhon
                            Phanom in order to determine feasible forward refueling sites in Laos.
                                <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> will also propose for
                            consideration by Bangkok alternate launching sites other than Nakhom
                            Phanom. The possible use of other sites in Thailand will be studied by
                            Embassy Bangkok and Commander, U.S. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>, having in mind military factors as well as the
                            likelihood of approval by the Thai Government which must be sought
                            before any extension in operations beyond the present authorization.</p>
                        <p>4. Commander, U.S. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> proposed that
                            Washington accept the principle that the current Prairie Fire boundary
                            is a coordination line and authorize Military Assistance Command,
                            Vietnam (<gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>) and Embassy Vientiane to
                            coordinate locally for exploitation of targets west of Prairie Fire
                            boundary. Vientiane felt case by case coordination locally submitted
                            through Commander in Chief, Pacific (<gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>) for approval by Washington was adequate, but
                            agreed to leave decision on this subject up to Washington.</p>
                        <p>5. Initiate a Prairie Fire intelligence collection operation, exploiting
                            the potential of Kha tribesmen indigenous to the Prairie Fire area as
                            elements of a low-level <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>-directed
                            intelligence net.</p>
                        <p>6. Since enemy operations in Laos threatening Khe Sanh area appeared to
                            require extension of dump truck area southward in Laos, it was agreed
                            that Embassy Vientiane would submit a proposal through channels for such
                            extension.</p>
                        <p>7. Embassy Vientiane proposed an increase in A–1 and A–26 aircraft
                            positioned in Thailand and available for operations in Laos. It was
                            agreed that the weekly planning meetings at Udorn between the 7th Air

                        <p rend="center">The Problem</p>
                        <p>To estimate likely Communist intentions in Laos over the next 2–3
                            months.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. We believe that Communist intentions in Laos are highly contingent on
                            developments in South Vietnam. The Communists have the capability to
                            reduce the area controlled by the Laotian Government to a few enclaves
                            in fairly short order. For the present, however, Hanoi's primary concern
                            in Laos is with the security of the vital panhandle infiltration routes;
                            in these circumstances it is unlikely that the Communists would wish to
                            over-extend their forces in Laos or run grave risks of destroying the
                            general framework of the 1962 settlement. Thus, we believe on balance,
                            that they will probably take a few more positions and then reduce their
                            military pressures during the rainy season.</p>
                        <p>B. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that the Communists might press
                            their advantage. The chances of Hanoi adopting this course would
                            increase in the months ahead if the war in South Vietnam reached a
                            critical juncture and Hanoi saw advantage in deliberately opening a <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0707"/>“second front” in Laos in order
                            to place further strain on US resources. Or, if Hanoi were confident at
                            some point that negotiations on South Vietnam were at hand, it might
                            think it useful to take as much territory in Laos as possible to
                            strengthen the Communist bargaining position.<note n="2" xml:id="d346fn2">Lt. Gen. Marshall S. Carter, The Director, National
                                Security Agency, believes the estimate is overly influenced by the
                                contingent relationship between developments in the war in South
                                Vietnam and North Vietnamese activities in Laos. Communist military
                                capability now present in northern Laos is greater than at any time
                                since 1962. While the Communists may be content to take and hold
                                only those areas previously under Pathet Lao control, they
                                nonetheless, have the capability to extend their control over
                                additional areas of northern as well as southern Laos. In their view
                                they could take this action virtually without regard to or risk of
                                any meaningful US counteraction. Gen. Carter, therefore, believes
                                that a greater emphasis should be given to this possibility.

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. The Present Situation</p>
                        <p>1. Since the 1962 Geneva settlement, the war in Laos has been
                            characterized by Communist advances in the dry season (November to April
                            in Laos) and counteroffensives by the Royal Lao Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) forces during the rainy season (May to
                            October). These annual military operations, however, have been limited,
                            and at least until this year neither side has appeared anxious to take
                            action in areas that might provoke a strong reaction by the other.</p>
                        <p>2. Although generally the fortunes of war had seesawed back and forth, by
                            the fall of 1967 <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces had
                            penetrated well into some areas usually dominated by the Communists.
                            This process was highlighted by the RLG capture in August 1966 of the
                            Nam Bac Valley<note n="3" xml:id="d346fn3">The town colloquially
                                referred to as Nam Bac is shown on the maps as Ban Nam Bac.
                                [Footnote in the source text. The maps, showing Communist-controlled

                            Prabang—which the Communists had controlled for nearly 10 years. These
                            successes had by the summer of 1967 given the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> new confidence, and in September 1967 <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces planned a further offensive in
                            the Nam Bac area.</p>
                        <p>3. In mid-January 1968 the Communist forces turned the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> offensive at Nam Bac into a debacle for
                            the government. Meanwhile, the Communists had begun to launch offensives
                            elsewhere in Laos. In support of these operations, the Communists have
                            introduced new forces from North Vietnam and redeployed other units,
                            possibly including several battalions normally assigned to duty along
                            the infiltration routes to South Vietnam. In general, the present
                            Communist offensive has been directed so far at targets which were
                            either held by them in 1962 or attacked by them in their campaigns since
                            then.</p>
                        <p>4. In north Laos, in addition to Nam Bac, Communist forces concentrated
                            on Phou Pha Thi, and on 11 March they destroyed the US navigational <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0708"/>site located there. They have
                            also attacked other guerrilla positions and have taken the villages of
                            Tha Thom and Sala Den Dine, about 30–35 miles north of Paksane.</p>
                        <p>5. In central-south Laos, Communist forces have harassed Route 13, the
                            main road artery connecting northern and southern Laos, and on 6
                            February they blew up the bridge on this route across the Se Bang Fai
                            River between Thakhek and Savannakhet. They also took Muong Phalane
                            against minimal <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> resistance and
                            forced the removal of the US Tacan navigational site in that area.</p>
                        <p>6. Further south, the Communists have sharply increased their activities
                            in the Bolovens plateau area, reducing <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> positions around Saravane and taking a number of
                            villages along Route 16 in the rice-rich Se Done Valley. In late
                            February they attacked the town of Lao Ngam<note n="4" xml:id="d346fn4">Lao Ngam is shown as Ban Lao Ngam on the maps. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> (the center of the Se Done Valley pacification
                            program) and the outskirts of the district capital of Attopeu.</p>
                        <p>7. The Communists, with their ability to reinforce rapidly from North
                            Vietnam, have long had the capability to defeat the qualitatively
                            inferior <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces and to seize control
                            of most of Laos. Every year Hanoi has strengthened its forces in Laos
                            for the dry season operations. What is noteworthy this year, however, is
                            the extent of the reinforcement and the intensity of operations.
                            Information on reinforcement in recent months is not firm, but it may
                            total 10–14 battalion-size North Vietnamese Army combat units over the
                            past year, concentrated primarily in the Bolovens plateau area in the
                            south and around Phou Pha Thi in the north. This would place total North
                            Vietnamese combat and support personnel in Laos at about 35,000.<note n="5" xml:id="d346fn5">This includes North Vietnamese Army elements
                                in the corridor concerned primarily with support of supply routes to
                                South Vietnam. Some of the estimated reinforcement in the Bolovens
                                plateau area may actually reflect a westward deployment of units
                                already in the corridor. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> The
                            Communist position has also been strengthened by their recent advances
                            westward, and by the losses in manpower, material, and morale that they
                            have been able to inflict on the RLG. Accordingly, we estimate that the
                            Communists could, in fairly short order, reduce the RLG area of control
                            to a few enclaves.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. The Outlook</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">A. Factors Influencing Further Communist
                            Actions</p>
                        <p>8. There are, however, other factors more important than raw capabilities
                            which bear on the future scope of Communist actions in Laos. North
                            Vietnam, of course, desires to preserve Communist control over border
                            areas. Hanoi also has a continuing concern to protect and strengthen the
                            Pathet Lao territorial base while retaining the option to return the
                            Pathet Lao to active participation in the tripartite government. In <pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0709"/>part, recent military moves
                            have been a reaction to the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>'s
                            “nibbling” tactics and to the raids of guerrilla forces deep within
                            territory nominally under Communist control.</p>
                        <p>9. For the present, however, Hanoi's overriding concern in Laos is with
                            the infiltration system in the Lao corridor. The security of the supply
                            and infiltration routes developed there since the early 1960's has
                            become even more critical to the Communist effort in South Vietnam in
                            recent months. The Communist “winter-spring” offensive in South Vietnam
                            has clearly required not only additional men and material in preparation
                            for major and widespread military action, but also increased use of the
                            corridor.</p>
                        <p>10. Hanoi's normal concern with the panhandle has thus been intensified,
                            while at the same time US bombing and other expanded allied activities
                            have been imposing greater strains on the Communist logistic system in
                            Laos. Hanoi almost certainly desires to improve the routes in the
                            panhandle of Laos, expand the area of control there, and possibly
                            develop alternative routes further west. Although the present Communist
                            logistical system is adequate for the delivery of needed supplies,
                            additional routes would provide the Communists with greater flexibility
                            and force the US to spread its interdiction efforts over a wider
                            area.</p>
                        <p>11. In protecting the corridor and in advancing other local objectives in
                            Laos, Hanoi would not wish at this time to take actions which
                            unnecessarily complicated or hindered support of the war in South
                            Vietnam. If, for example, it employed its capability to seize and hold
                            most of Laos, the task of supporting and defending these extended lines
                            of communication could detract from the main effort in South Vietnam.
                            Such a military campaign would completely upset the Geneva arrangements
                            which still have some advantages for North Vietnam, and more important,
                            might precipitate larger scale US operations against Hanoi's supply
                            lines in the panhandle.</p>
                        <p>12. Hanoi probably believes that its present limited offensive in Laos
                            will not by itself provoke large-scale US intervention in Laos. Instead,
                            it may believe that these operations tend to deter such action by
                            showing the US and Souvanna that the Communists have the capability to
                            make such intervention extremely costly. Finally, Hanoi may believe that
                            even the present level of its military activities in Laos will cause
                            such concern in Thailand as to affect the Thai commitment in South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">B. Likely Communist Actions</p>
                        <p>13. On balance, we believe the Communists do not wish to destroy the
                            general framework of the 1962 settlement, and, therefore, are not likely
                            to push their military offensive so far as to run grave risks of this
                            result. Thus, they will probably take a few more positions and then
                            reduce their military pressures during the rainy season. They will, of
                            course, defend the infiltration corridor as necessary, but Hanoi
                            probably still prefers its <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0710"/>present use of these routes to the situation that might arise if Hanoi
                            expanded the conflict to the point of precipitating large-scale US
                            intervention in Laos.</p>
                        <p>14. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that the Communists might press
                            their advantage. The chances of Hanoi adopting this course would
                            increase in the months ahead if the war in South Vietnam reached a
                            critical juncture and Hanoi saw advantage in deliberately opening a
                            “second front” in Laos in order to place further strain on US resources.
                            Or, if Hanoi were confident at some point that negotiations on South
                            Vietnam were at hand, it might think it useful to take as much territory
                            in Laos as possible to strengthen the Communist bargaining
                                position.<note n="6" xml:id="d346fn6">See <gloss target="#t_NSA1">NSA</gloss> footnote to Conclusion B. [Footnote in the source

                                to Vientiane, March 23, the Department of State agreed with
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> that
                                coordination for Prairie Fire operations should not be limited to
                                U.S. officials in Saigon and Vientiane. The Department agreed that
                                Washington officials should have a role and was prepared to support
                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> on that point.
                                (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I regard <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> proposal as part of its
                            continuing two pronged campaign (a) to extrude itself from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> line of command, and (b) to
                            encroach further with its high risk Prairie Fire operations which in
                            practice have proved to have infinitesimal military value relative to
                            political considerations.</p>
                        <p>2. Since Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAUSG1">Sharp</persName> and I see
                            eye to eye on these matters, I find it useful to keep him in the
                            picture, not only with respect to this particular set of operations, but
                            in the overall introduction of value judgements to increasingly myopic
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>3. Secondly, if we permitted direct Saigon-Vientiane resolution of these
                            matters, we would be deluged by a flood of proposals from <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss>
                            <pb n="679" xml:id="pg_679" facs="0711"/> (which has nothing else to do)
                            and which would require a lot of our valuable time batting down.</p>
                        <p>4. In practice, we have been able to work the current system quite
                            satisfactorily. The last proposal cleared Vientiane, Honolulu and
                            Washington in less than 24 hours. However, 36 hours later the “urgent”
                            operation has not taken place because <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> has not accorded <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> high enough priority to merit an allocation of
                            helicopters for this particular stunt.</p>
                        <p>5. You are doubtless aware that I regard <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss> as a dubious organization of marginal value and that
                            my views are shared by many senior military officers in Saigon, Honolulu
                            and Washington. Perhaps under the new management in Saigon they will
                            quietly disappear. At any rate, we hope Dept will do all possible to
                            keep them off our backs, because they distract time and energy to no
                            particular avail.</p>
                        <p>6. Therefore, I would recommend Dept continue to hold off <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> on this and other related questions at
                            least until views of new <gloss target="#t_COMUSMACV1">COMUSMACV</gloss>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Ambassador:</p>
                        <p>At Bill Bundy's request, the enclosed study<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">See the attachment to <ref target="#d350">Document
                                350</ref>.</note> was prepared during the last week and approved by
                            him March 23. Copies have been sent to <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0712"/>the Secretary, the Under Secretary, the Secretary of
                            Defense, and <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, among
                            others. The drafting was done by this office, the Thai Desk, our lawyers
                            (for Part III and the legal annex) and <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> (for the military
                            sections). The Joint Staff was represented by General Andrews (J–5) and
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Our basic mandate was to
                            consider the most dire outcome of current <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> military activities and decide what we should or could
                            do to counter it.</p>
                        <p>The paper was prepared at the time that a <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> was concluding that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> did not intend to push in force to the Mekong, a
                            conclusion shared by all agencies and the participants in our
                            exercise.</p>
                        <p>The urgent need to produce the study precluded consultation with either
                            you or Len Unger. I would, however, welcome your comments and assessment
                            because there is no doubt in my mind that we shall be addressing these
                            or related problems repeatedly in the foreseeable future. As you know,
                            such studies are usually prepared as the result of much pressure from
                            high places and it is difficult to question the premises without seeming
                            to fight the problem. At one meeting, <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> (Dick Steadman)
                            propounded the view that the enemy had the capability of effectively
                            taking the Panhandle in a matter of days. The ensuing discussion was
                            most educational.</p>
                        <p>Despite the haste in producing this paper, I am satisfied that it is a
                            fairly reasonable assessment; and it was certainly an eye-opener in
                            regard to our military capability to react.</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> recommendations seem to
                            me to be based on the assumption that we can take additional military
                            actions in Laos, and that otherwise the situation stays the same.</p>
                        <p>That assumption is almost certainly incorrect. The enemy will certainly
                            take steps to counter our ploy. They will attempt to destroy our forces
                            introduced on to their supply line. And they may very possibly use our
                            action as a pretext for an assault upon major Laotian cities.</p>
                        <p>In short, if we “hot up” the war in Laos we can expect with confidence
                            that the enemy will do the same for he has consistently shown fewer
                            inhibitions in Laos than we have shown. And he has the resources on the
                            spot. Unless we are prepared to contemplate a major war in Laos with the
                            overt commitment of American resources we had better be very careful,
                            indeed, in deciding on the <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss>
                            recommendations.</p>

                            capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces in Laos to take over the entire

                            below.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Assumptions</p>
                        <p>1. If the enemy wished to take the lowlands of the Laos Panhandle, he
                            could make quick thrusts to key points on the Mekong with little advance
                            notice. This would involve small forces maneuvering in open country
                            which would make them highly vulnerable to air power. However, such
                            operations could succeed within days in the face of crumbling Lao
                            resistance.</p>
                        <p>2. While the enemy would require a substantial buildup over a period of
                            weeks or even months to mount a coordinated drive to occupy all the
                            lowlands in the Panhandle, he could achieve the same objective by
                            following up his initial thrusts with a gradual buildup to extend his
                            hold on the lowlands. Such a strategy would be feasible, but would
                            probably require substantial diversion of forces and resources from
                            other operations.</p>
                        <p>3. If the enemy wished to take over all of Laos, including the
                            mountainous areas of the North, he would require a substantial buildup
                            over a period of months. However, a successful campaign in the Panhandle
                            could result in a crumbling of resistance also in the North; and it is
                            therefore possible that Laos might be reduced to an enclave around
                            Vientiane in a matter of weeks after the launch of a determined enemy
                            campaign.</p>

                            consult with the other parties if Thailand decides that Communist
                            actions in Laos threaten it or endanger the peace of the area. Such
                            consultations would be held “in order to agree on the measures which
                            shall be taken for the common defense.” By the same article we are
                            committed to “act to meet the common danger” if a Communist attack in
                            Laos were not simply a threat but were part of an armed attack against
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>In July 1963, we privately assured Thailand that the U.S. “will not sit
                            idly by and allow the Communists to become entrenched on the borders of
                            Thailand.” President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            authorized consultations in 1964 “looking toward joint Thai-U.S.

                            drive toward the borders of Thailand.”</p>
                        <p>The President stated “we must be prepared to act promptly and effectively
                            to check such a drive if necessary.” The resulting plan (Project 22<note n="5" xml:id="d350fn5">Code name of a U.S.-Thai military plan for

                                which the Thai regard as vital to their security. It was authorized
                                by the President on June 22, 1964 (from which its name—Project 22.

                            and Thai actions in Laos as well as Thailand was approved by the Joint

                        <p>Project 22 is a plan, not a commitment. It provides for implementation
                            “only upon mutual agreement and consent of both the United States and
                            Royal Thai Governments.” However, the Thais will justifiably expect the
                            U.S. to take meaningful action to meet a threat to the Thai border.</p>
                        <p>U.S. or Thai operations in Laos to protect Thailand in the contingency
                            stated require the consent of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>.
                            Failure to obtain that consent would raise serious legal problems under
                            the 1962 Geneva Agreement and <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>,
                            and would preclude reliance on the Tonkin Gulf Resolution as
                            Congressional authorization of such action.</p>
                        <p>B. Laos. The United States has no defense commitments to Laos, but the
                            obligations of Article IV of the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                            Treaty extend to the territory of Laos. However, the 1962 Geneva
                            Agreement committed the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> not to
                            recognize the protection of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> and
                            not to allow the introduction of foreign troops into Laos. The Geneva
                            Agreement was not intended to deprive Laos of its inherent right of
                            self-defense against armed attack, but the present Lao Government, which
                            owes its existence to the Geneva Accords, is not likely to request
                            foreign troops even in circumstances in which such action could be
                            justifiable. It would almost certainly not repudiate the 1962 Agreement
                            by involving <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, despite the
                            Western view that the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Treaty
                            could be applicable should the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            justifiably invoke it.</p>

                            Contingency</p>
                        <p>A. Thailand. Although deeply concerned by the recent Tet offensive,
                            increased insurgency in North Thailand, and Communist advances in Laos,
                            the Thai Government has kept its nerve and reacted calmly. This has been
                            based on confidence that these setbacks are temporary and the U.S. has
                            the strength and will to defend Thailand effectively.</p>
                        <p>Any indication that the U.S. was unwilling to carry out what the Thai
                            regard as our commitments, particularly under present circumstances,
                            would result in a very serious and adverse Thai reaction. This could
                            include loss of cooperation and operational flexibility in use of Thai
                            air bases, delay or refusal to deploy the forces currently training for
                            Vietnam, etc.—in short an “agonizing reappraisal” of the whole basis of
                            Thai support for the United States in Southeast Asia today.</p>
                        <p>The Thai have made it clear in the past that if we are considering the
                            deployment of U.S. ground forces to Thailand as a deterrent to Communist
                            actions in Laos, we must be prepared to use these forces outside of
                            Thailand. They are not interested in another deployment a la 1962 when
                            U.S. forces came simply to stay in Thailand. Additionally, the Thai have
                            made it clear that if we are prepared to bring in troops for use outside
                            Thailand, they are prepared to join forces with us in these
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>B. Laos. A concerted enemy move to the Mekong would be a heavy blow to
                            the position of Souvanna, but he might be persuaded to remain <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0717"/>as Prime Minister on the
                            grounds that he is best able to obtain foreign support and to function
                            as national rallying point. Any other Prime Minister would be confronted
                            with even greater internal dissension unless the King, with U.S.
                            support, were to intervene with unaccustomed vigor. National divisions
                            would be especially along North-South lines, with the southerners
                            tending to seek foreign support without reference to Vientiane. In the
                            southern cities there would be panic, and the mass exodus across the
                            Mekong would not be confined to civilians. Southern leaders might,
                            however, think in terms of holding beachheads around such cities as
                            Thakhek, Savannakhet and Pakse.</p>
                        <p>If the Communists move militarily to take over all of Laos, we must
                            assume that they would take parallel political steps such as the
                            presentation of a “true” Government of National Union. It is hard to see
                            how the Soviet Union could avoid transferring its recognition to such a
                            government. Even if this were not to occur, but especially if it does,
                            Souvanna would consider his position untenable and his neutralist
                            government would come to an end. Under the contingency of an all-out
                            Communist effort, the crumbling of the political structure would be of
                            major proportions. There would be defections of important political
                            leaders to the Communists, particularly from among Souvanna's
                            Neutralists. Even if the Government remained in a Vientiane enclave,
                            many other political (and military) leaders would cross into
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has
                            consistently said that he would not ask for foreign military
                            intervention because he did not wish to turn neutral Laos into a major
                            battleground, it is conceivable that in a calamitous military situation
                            he might ask for foreign intervention to avoid the extinction of his
                            country. More likely, however, he would resign and let another leader
                            issue such a call. Intervention would presumably be asked on the grounds
                            of collective self-defense rather than the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> protocol.</p>

                        <p>1. Lao Actions: Call for Geneva Conference. We believe Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> would be
                            prepared to issue such a call (presumably addressed to the Co-Chairmen
                            of the 1962 Conference) since it fits in with his carefully phased
                            sequence of approaches which has now reached stage 3 of the following
                            series: (1) calls for action by the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>;
                            (2) appeals to the Co-Chairmen; (3) asking the Co-Chairmen to call for
                            “consultations” among the Geneva signatories as called for by Article 4
                            of the 1962 Declaration, which Souvanna did February 29, without success
                            to date. The logical next step (4) is to call for reconvening the Geneva
                            Conference, a call which the Communists would resist unless they are
                            ready to agree to such a meeting for discussions of a wider Indochina
                                <pb n="686" xml:id="pg_686" facs="0718"/>settlement. The Lao Prime
                            Minister would probably prefer to take step 4 in an emergency, rather as
                            a deterrent to head off the contingency.</p>
                        <p>A call for a new Geneva Conference would have some limited value by
                            helping to dramatize the situation and by showing that Laos was
                            exhausting all means available to it under the Geneva Accords. Although
                            the 1962 Declaration does not specifically envisage a reconvening of the
                            Geneva Conference, Article 4 obligates the signatories “in the event of
                            a violation or threat of violation of the sovereignty, independence,
                            neutrality, unity or territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Laos, to
                            consult jointly with the Royal Government of Laos and among themselves
                            in order to consider measures which might prove to be necessary to
                            ensure the observance of these principles and the other provisions of
                            the present Declaration.”</p>

                            also call for consultations under Article IV(2) of the Manila Pact.
                            These consultations could be used to publicize the Communist threat in
                            Laos. This could be a prelude to a <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Council meeting on this matter—either a special

                        <p>2) Overt Use of Other Thai Air Assets. To impress the enemy with the
                            credibility of Thai intentions, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss>,
                            with agreement of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, might employ
                            the tactical air assets of the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>
                            overtly in combat operations in Laos. Air strikes could be accomplished
                            by the T–28's, F–86F's, and F–5's in the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss>'s inventory. However, of the 27 F–86's in the
                            inventory, only 15 are currently operationally ready. Also, the limited
                            number of F–5's (6) diminishes their potential military contribution.
                            Their principal contribution would be psychological, i.e., a forceful
                            demonstration of Thai willingness to act to meet the threat.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. U.S. Air Actions</p>
                        <p>1) U.S. Tactical Air Operations in Laos. Areas of U.S. “armed
                            reconnaissance,” called Steel Tiger and Barrel Roll, are presently
                            confined to the eastern Panhandle and northeastern Laos (Maps at Tab B).
                            Strikes by U.S. tactical aircraft outside these areas may now be
                            conducted in response to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> requests
                            concurred in by Embassy Vientiane. In order to cope with situations
                            envisaged under this contingency in a systematic manner and to enable
                            full employment of U.S. tactical air power against the enemy, the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> would probably request necessary
                            enlargement of presently established “armed reconnaissance” areas of
                            Steel Tiger and Barrel Roll to coincide with significant areas of
                            Communist penetrations. Target selection would have to be controlled to
                            avoid unnecessary danger to the Lao civilian populations.</p>
                        <p>2) Arc Light Operations in Laos. B–52 strikes on Communist forces
                            advancing on or in the Mekong lowlands could be conducted to supplement
                            Arc Light operations presently being conducted in the eastern Panhandle,
                            generally opposite the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, and add to
                            the interdiction efforts of U.S. tactical air. Arc Light targets in new
                            areas would be coordinated with Souvanna by the Embassy.</p>
                        <p>3) U.S. Air Units to Thailand. The crowded air base situation in Thailand
                            and the possible deployment to Vietnam of available air units would
                            limit our flexibility in this regard. Additional construction and the
                            attendant delay would be necessary to increase B–52 basing in Thailand.
                            However, an increase in tactical air assets could, with <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> concurrence, be accommodated at
                            existing bases. These would add sortie assets for use in Laos. However,
                            a decision to deploy additional tactical air assets without utilizing
                            Nam Phong would saturate existing facilities and decrease <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0720"/>the effectiveness of base operations.
                            Given the situation of a major Communist drive toward the Mekong and the
                            attendant requirements for increased U.S. air efforts in Laos, very high
                            priority would be given to the allocation of appropriate U.S. air
                            resources, propeller aircraft as well as jets. If the decision were made
                            to deploy additional U.S. tactical air assets, the move should be
                            coupled with appropriate publicity linking this action with our concern
                            about the situation in Laos, to achieve maximum deterrent effect.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">2. Ground</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">a. Thai Ground Actions</p>
                        <p>1) Deployment of Additional Thai Ground Units to Northeast. Only about 21
                            infantry maneuver battalions (18 Army and 3 Marines) and perhaps as many
                            as six battalions of artillery, tank and/or engineers, could be deployed
                            to the Northeast relatively quickly, and these only as a show of force.
                            Their operational readiness is severely hampered by logistics
                            deficiencies, especially in the area of tactical mobility, training, and
                            low manning. Before they could begin to participate in combat
                            operations, the U.S. would have to take extraordinary logistics actions
                            to include airlifting equipment from <gloss target="#t_CONUS1">CONUS</gloss> stocks since in-country U.S. depot stocks have been
                            drastically depleted. Depending on when executed, stocks may not be
                            readily available in the U.S. Even then, Thai capability to sustain
                            effective combat operations would be minimal.</p>
                        <p>The current status of the Royal Thai Army may be summarized as follows:
                            The on-board strength of the Thai Army is approximately 100,000 (72% of
                            its authorized level of 139,000). <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supported strength totals 89,000. The remaining 11,000 are
                            such non <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supported units as General
                            and Special staffs, Military Circle Headquarters, and the King's Guard.
                            The <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supported units include 3
                            infantry divisions, 1 cavalry division, a separate regimental combat
                            team, and miscellaneous airborne, special forces, engineer, artillery
                            and signal units. Collectively, on paper, the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss> has about 30 infantry maneuver battalion equivalents,
                            10 artillery battalions, 3 tank battalions, 4 engineer battalions, 1
                            airborne battalion, and a special forces battalion. In terms of actual
                            on-board strength, these units total approximately 40,000 men, well
                            below their authorized level, of which about 11,000 are infantry
                            personnel (the equivalent of 18 maneuver battalions, if some patching
                            together were done). The remaining 39,000 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>-supported personnel comprise non-combat signal,
                            transportation, ordnance, <gloss target="#t_QM1">QM</gloss>, medical and
                            headquarters elements.</p>
                        <p>Some five infantry maneuver and three artillery battalion equivalents are
                            currently deployed on counter-insurgency missions.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, there are three maneuver battalion equivalents of Thai
                            Marines garrisoned in the Sattahip area.</p>
                        <pb n="689" xml:id="pg_689" facs="0721"/>
                        <p>2) Divert Thai Force Now in Training for <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> to Northeast. A Thai brigade of some 5,500 personnel is
                            now in training for deployment to <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> in
                            July. The force could be deployed to the Northeast in lieu of Vietnam,
                            if the final phases of training were completed after deployment. This
                            assumes the force would not engage immediately in combat operations.
                            However, this step should not be taken lightly. Once deployed to the
                            Northeast, it is highly questionable that it would redeploy to Vietnam
                            as long as a threat from Laos existed. In this event, the Communist
                            threat, even though perhaps not implemented, would succeed in tying down
                            this operationally ready and well-equipped force when its services would
                            be better utilized in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. One
                            additional factor is that this force consists of 50% volunteers whose
                            notivations are, at least in part, based on the financial remuneration
                            of Vietnam service. This would be denied if the force deployed to the
                            Northeast. The morale implications are obvious. In summary, the
                            diversion of this unit from its <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>
                            mission should be considered only as a last resort.</p>
                        <p>3) Call-Up Thai Reserves. The <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> has a
                            mobilization system and plans which provide for a call-up of
                            approximately 200,000 personnel. Except for the possible favorable
                            domestic impact this would have in the U.S. (should U.S. Reserves be
                            called, we could at least point out that the Thai have done the same),
                            this action should not be seriously considered. These reservists have
                            had no active-duty training since their discharge from the Army;
                            qualified officers and <gloss target="#t_NCO1">NCO</gloss>'s are not
                            available for assignment to the units called; and the problem of
                            equipping the personnel called up appears virtually insurmountable.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">b. U.S. Ground Actions</p>
                        <p>1) Deployment of U.S. Ground Forces to Thailand. The deployment of
                            perhaps a brigade or two of the U.S. Army would probably have a
                            significant deterrent effect on an enemy decision on whether to proceed
                            to the Mekong. Thai misgivings regarding U.S. deployments to be used in
                            a defensive posture would first have to be overcome. A deployment of
                            this magnitude, however, would require a call-up of U.S. reservists or a
                            drawdown of Army units from elsewhere. With Reserve callup, two brigades
                            could be made available by the end of July,<note n="7" xml:id="d350fn7">The contingency of a rapid enemy thrust to the Mekong applies only
                                to the dry season, which lasts from October to May. [Footnote in the
                                source text.]</note> but would preclude any further deployments to
                            South Vietnam, if required. An additional division could be made
                            available through Reserve callup by the end of September, but major
                            problems with equipment procurement and additional funds make even this
                            capability doubtful. An argument against providing forces to Thailand is
                            the commitment implication attendant to such an action. Should the
                            deterrent effect not be accomplished, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> will undoubtedly expect that this force will be <pb n="690" xml:id="pg_690" facs="0722"/>committed to operations, as the
                            first increment of additional U.S. forces they would expect under
                            Project 22. Another possibility, perhaps more remote, is that if
                            Communist activity in Laos were coupled with significantly increased
                            insurgent activity in Thailand, to include attacks against air bases,
                            the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> might ask that U.S. forces be
                            committed to CI operations in Thailand. In either event, it might be
                            politically difficult to get U.S. forces out should we decide not to
                            implement Project 22.</p>
                        <p>2) Measures Related to Possible Reconstitution of U.S. Stocks in
                            Thailand. A possible deterrent measure would be an effort by us to give
                            the impression that we are rebuilding U.S. project stocks in Thailand to
                            the point where they were in 1964. This would entail certain overt
                            gestures, in the form of providing readily available material to the
                            stocks, with appropriate unofficial “leaking” to insure the other side
                            got the word. Some actual rebuilding of the stocks, albeit necessarily
                            minimal, would have to be accomplished to maintain a degree of

                            into Laos). This program employs about 2,000 Special Forces personnel
                            (including 300 U.S.) organized into reconnaissance and exploitation
                            teams which presently operate from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>
                            bases against enemy lines of communications in Laos within an area of
                            operations as shown on the attached map (Tab C). Exploitation of targets
                            west of this area could be accomplished on a case-by-case basis through
                            coordination between <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and
                            Embassy Vientiane, and if considered necessary, with Washington
                            approval. Operations will be significantly more effective by using Thai
                            staging bases when weather prevents the use of SVN bases.</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Operations. A significant increase
                            in <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> operations is extremely difficult
                            before the end of the present dry season. Depending on time available
                            and the location of the threat, intensification is possible which would
                            result in increased intelligence on advancing NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces and intensified harassment of these troops
                            placing an additional burden on the attackers. Intensification of
                            guerrilla operations would be greatly enhanced if additional tactical
                            air and helicopter support were made available.</p>

                        <p>a. Geneva Machinery. An enemy drive to the Mekong would lend urgency (as
                            well as greater plausibility) to Souvanna's appeal for reconvening of
                            the 1962 Geneva Conference. The considerations under section V would
                            apply, except that such a conference would be pointless if convened <pb n="691" xml:id="pg_691" facs="0723"/>only after the enemy had
                            achieved all his objectives. There is no reason to believe that the
                            Communist countries would heed a call to such a conference unless they
                            were prepared, on terms acceptable to them, to deal with the entire
                            Indochina problem. In view of the need for speed, Souvanna might try to
                            settle for a “little” Geneva Conference without the Communists. Even
                            non-Communist signatories of the 1962 agreement (France, India, Burma,
                            Cambodia) would probably refuse to attend such a meeting, which would be
                            only a minor propaganda operation.</p>
                        <p>b. Appeal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. In
                            addition to his appeal for a Geneva Conference, which would take some
                            time to bear fruit even under favorable circumstances, Souvanna should
                            be encouraged to take his case directly to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. He is judged to be reluctant to take
                            his case to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, largely because of
                            his past experiences with an ineffectual <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mission to Laos, and also because he regards the Geneva
                            framework as overriding, but he could probably be persuaded to appeal to
                            the UNSC in a desperate situation, as means to arouse world public
                            opinion. There would be difficulty in obtaining inscription, but a
                            majority would probably be found in favor.</p>
                        <p>While a Soviet veto would presumably preclude any helpful resolution,
                            resort to the SC would have two beneficial aspects: (1) Souvanna's
                            credentials as a neutralist and the record of his appeals to the Geneva
                            machinery would make his denunciations of Communist aggression fairly
                            effective; and (2) he would imply, or perhaps state, that he was
                            exhausting the last peaceful means available to him before calling for
                            direct foreign assistance. This could be an important signal to the
                            enemy. On the negative side, we must expect any SC discussion to
                            degenerate quickly into a sterile rehearsal of old charges about
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Should Souvanna go to the Security Council before he had exhausted the
                            scenario envisaged under V.A above, it is possible that the Soviets
                            would claim that the matter should properly be discussed by a reconvened
                            1962 Geneva Conference rather than by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This would be a plus if it were to mean that the
                            Soviets would support the convening of a Geneva Conference. In effect,
                            there would be an aspect of ju-jitsu: utilizing the momentum of Soviet
                            opposition to SC consideration to impel them to a Geneva Conference.
                            More likely, however, the Soviets would oppose inscription and try to
                            confuse the debate without actually commiting themselves to a Geneva
                            Conference.</p>

                            consultations (see V.A.2 above) the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Council could meet in special (or the regular)
                            session as a means of further dramatizing the seriousness of the
                            situation. The U.S. should be prepared to take the lead but would seek
                            support from other Asian member nations as well.</p>

                        <p>1. Partial or Full Implementation of Project 22. A full scale Communist
                            thrust toward the Mekong lowlands could well trigger a Thai request for
                            implementation of Project 22 (CINCUSTAFF Plan 1/65) or similar <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> contingency plans. At Tab D is a
                            listing of U.S. and Thai force commitments under Project 22. U.S. forces
                            committed total 138,440 (of which 134,040 are Army) and Thai forces,
                            62,800. Of the approximately 63,000 Thai forces committed, some 10,000
                            are relatively operationally ready but, even with these, certain
                            equipment deficiencies would have to be remedied by the U.S.
                            particularly in the area of mobility. Furthermore, many of these
                            personnel are presently committed to CI operations in Thailand. The
                            remainder of the Thai units committed to the plan have serious manning
                            and logistical shortfalls, especially the combat support units. Indeed,
                            many of the units do not even exist. Even with a concerted effort by the
                            U.S., utilizing existing equipment in theater, these problems are not
                            susceptible of rapid solution. In short, we should not encourage the
                            Thai to believe we are prepared to move into the Mekong lowlands.</p>
                        <p>2. Expand Prairie Fire Program in Panhandle. Prairie Fire (US/<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> Special Forces into Laos) operations
                            could be expanded and improved by removing the existing western
                            limitation to Prairie Fire operations; by permitting employment of teams
                            throughout the Panhandle; by author-izing operations into Laos from
                            Thailand bases and from forward operating sites in Laos, if available;
                            and by authorizing Prairie Fire to supplement its operations by
                            developing the tribal guerrilla warfare potential.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VII. Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. If the enemy moves to take over the Panhandle lowlands, it is unlikely
                            that we will be able to determine his ultimate intentions quickly. His
                            initial moves might be probes (as in the past), or diversions, or the
                            beginning of a much more ambitious undertaking.</p>
                        <p>B. Even though an enemy operation to take over all of Laos in unlikely
                            and also apt to be preceded by a considerable buildup, the possibility
                            of a crumbling of almost all Lao resistance exists if the enemy makes
                            some determined thrusts in the South and follows them up with occupation
                            of the populous Southern lowlands.</p>
                        <p>C. The following factors will make it difficult to reach a firm U.S./Thai
                            decision on major military countermeasures such as the implementation of
                            Project 22:</p>
                        <p>1. Shortage of readily available Thai and U.S. personnel, compounded by
                            serious logistic problems;</p>
                        <p>2. The uncertain legal basis for action on Lao territory without the
                            consent of the RLG, and predictable differences between the U.S. view of
                            its commitments to Thailand and Thai expectations;</p>
                        <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0725"/>
                        <p>3. The difficulty of evaluating enemy intentions as evidenced by
                            experience in November 1965 when Communist forces pushed to Thakhek on
                            the Mekong (and were repulsed by the FAR) without triggering contingency
                            plans.</p>
                        <p>D. The factors cited above point in favor of undertaking promptly
                            measures short of Project 22 for their deterrent effect.</p>
                        <p>E. If these measures should not prevent the Communists from establishing
                            themselves in force on the Mekong, a wholly new strategic situation
                            would result which would raise serious questions about whether the U.S.
                            should deploy major forces into Thailand, enter Laos in force from the
                            East, etc. This contingency lies outside the scope of this paper and
                            would have to be examined separately.</p>

                        <p>1. I thoroughly concur that post mortem of loss Site 85 is in order.
                            Suggest your people and mine work out procedures for such analysis at
                            next weekly Udorn meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe you should understand, however, that enemy force was not
                            “relatively small.” Our intelligence indicates their numbers between
                            five and seven battalions, with artillery and rocket support,
                            considerably <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0726"/>outnumbering local
                            defense forces, which never numbered more than 1,000 men in 12 kilometer
                            defensive perimeter which drawn around Site 85.</p>
                        <p>3. We made clear from the very beginning that this site could not be
                            defended against a determined and superior enemy force. We gave regular
                            and accurate estimates of its progressive deterioration, and as early as
                            Feb. 26, advised you that it could probably not be held beyond March 10.
                            Therefore, its fall should have come as no surprise to anyone.</p>
                        <p>4. The manner in which enemy accomplished its fall is, however,
                            instructive, and should, I think, be carefully studied with view to
                            future operations. Artillery fire, at relatively long range, was
                            surprisingly accurate. According fragmentary reports of survivors,
                            direct hits were scored, very early in the barrage, upon personnel
                            quarters, operations structure, and bunkers. It seems possible that
                            installations were rendered effectively inoperable even before
                            destruction order was given. There may be some lessons in this which
                            should be studied with respect to length of time technical personnel
                            should be required stay at their posts after installation falls within
                            artillery range. In hindsight, it seems to me we should have pulled all
                            technicians out morning March 10 even if this meant losing the last
                            several hours of the installation's capabilities.</p>
                        <p>5. What concerns me most is not the defense action, but the disruption of
                            pre-planned evacuation procedure. It is still not clear why technical
                            personnel went over cliff to a narrow ledge rather than down trail to
                            chopper pad. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and local personnel
                            subsequently went up same trail to installation searching for
                            technicians, so we know trail was traversable, even if under artillery
                            fire. It is also not clear to me how small Vietnamese suicide squad got
                            to installation site, although it seems they must have scaled the cliff
                            which all of us considered impassable.</p>
                        <p>6. We can give you details of action taken by 224-man local defense
                            forces at the site and casualties which they suffered in fighting. In
                            their defense effort, these amounted to 8 killed, 18 missing, and 33
                            wounded. Their defensive tactics, of course, are based on guerrilla
                            doctrines, and we will be pleased review with your people how we think
                            these should be handled in future instances, and especially the role
                            which air power can play in these tactics.”</p>

                        <p>Dear Dick:</p>
                        <p>The Department of State concurs in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposal to authorize <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> to establish intelligence nets in the authorized
                            Prairie Fire area.<note n="2" xml:id="d353fn2">In JCSM–171–68, March 21,
                                in which the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> stated that
                                intelligence operations in the Prairie Fire area of the Laos
                                Panhandle had been hampered by a lack of intelligence gathering
                                capacity. The U.S. decision to conform as closely as possible to the
                                Geneva Accords limited operations to reconnaissance, exploitative
                                missions, and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> road watch teams.
                                The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> proposed using the tribal
                                groups which inhabit the area as an intelligence net. Past
                                experience with Montagnards in South Vietnam demonstrated that these
                                groups would respond to U.S. influence and could be developed into
                                intelligence assets. (Washington National Records Center, RG 330,

                        <p>a. All recruiting will be conducted by indigenous Prairie Fire personnel;
                            recruits (later agents) will have no contact with U.S. Prairie Fire
                            personnel.</p>
                        <p>b. Training in RVN will take place in sanitized setting with minimum
                            contact with U.S. personnel. Airlift of recruits and agents to and from
                            RVN will be by <gloss target="#t_VNAF1">VNAF</gloss> copters.</p>
                        <p>c. Intelligence net, when fully operational, will not exceed a total of
                            sixty agent personnel. Ten principal agents are to be recruited and
                            trained during six-month period. After training, each principal agent
                            will in turn attempt to recruit five sub-agents or informers.</p>

                        <p>1. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff have
                            reviewed the situation in Laos on a continuing basis. Since 1962, the US
                            Government has based its policy for Laos upon observance of the Geneva
                            Agreements Respecting Laos (1962) which were signed by 14 nations,
                            including the United States and North Vietnam. The Agreements were
                            designed to guarantee the neutrality, independence, and territorial
                            integrity of Laos and the sovereignty of the Royal Laotian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Government of North Vietnam
                            has manipulated the Agreements to suit its own interests. The North
                            Vietnamese use the eastern Panhandle as a sanctuary and have developed a
                            logistic and troop movement system from North to South Vietnam through
                            that area. In addition, regular North Vietnamese Army units are being
                            employed in offensive operations against the forces of the Royal Laotian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) Generally, the US Government has
                            adhered to a policy of respect for the Geneva Agreements and has
                            undertaken military actions in Laos only in response to mounting North
                            Vietnamese violations. These military actions have been generally of low
                            intensity and have been conducted largely with the knowledge and consent
                            of the Royal Laotian Government. Further, these military actions have
                            been planned and executed carefully in order to preserve the fragile
                            political balance of power in Laos, to avoid public exposure, and to
                            minimize the likelihood of communist takeover of the entire country. The
                            North Vietnam/Laos Panhandle logistic and troop movement structure has
                            been expanded to the point where major North Vietnamese Army forces
                            threaten operations in I, II, and III Corps Tactical Zones in South
                            Vietnam. Due to the enemy Tet offensive, supported in large measure
                            through the Panhandle, pacification in South Vietnam suffered a serious
                            reverse. So long as North Vietnam controls eastern Laos, attainment of
                            US objectives in Southeast Asia will be most difficult.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_TS1">TS</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff propose
                            that you take action to initiate formal interdepartmental reassessment
                            of US policy for Laos. There is a need to identify methods whereby
                            efforts to obtain international support <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0730"/>to eliminate North Vietnamese exploitation of the
                            Geneva Agreements can be broadened and intensified. Measures to be
                            considered could include reconvening of the Geneva Signatories, direct
                            action to strengthen or replace the International Control Commission,
                            injection of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping force, or
                            other actions worthy of investigation.</p>
                        <p>5. (C) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommend that a memorandum,
                            substantially as contained in the Appendix hereto,<note n="2" xml:id="d354fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> be forwarded to

                        <p>The current operation (Delaware/Lamson 216) does not involve employment
                            of U.S. or <gloss target="#t_ARVN1">ARVN</gloss> units in Laos. In
                            emergency situations, however, U.S. forces are authorized to act in
                            self-defense against attacks from locations in Laos. Furthermore,
                            Prairie Fire forces of up to three platoons may be used in Laos under
                            current authorities. Past Prairie Fire operations of up to three
                            platoons have been satisfactorily protected from publicity and have not
                            resulted in any major outcry.</p>
                        <p>Present authorities may be adequate. However, the size and dispersion of
                            enemy units and supplies in this area may require the commitment of
                            Prairie Fire forces larger than three platoons, especially in view of
                            pressures being exerted by U.S. and Vietnamese forces operating in the
                            Ashau Valley.</p>

                            the luncheon today,<note n="2" xml:id="d356fn2">See <ref target="#d358">Document 358</ref>.</note> an operation into Base Area 607
                            which is in Laos just across the border from the Ashau Valley. Although
                            this is presented in terms of an “expansion” of Prairie Fire operations,
                            it is really a conventional battalion-sized operation although limited
                            in time. It is supposed to last four to six days.</p>
                        <p>2. A battalion-sized operation across an international border cannot be
                            kept secret, even if it is Top Secret. The record is replete with cases
                            where Top Secret operations in Laos of less intrinsic newsworthiness
                            have been compromised within a short period of time. The press is more
                            likely to exaggerate than to underplay the scope of the operation.</p>
                        <p>3. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has not
                            commented on this proposed operation because he considers that it
                            involves a major political decision which can only be made in
                            Washington. In the past, he has consistently expressed strong doubts
                            that any such operation could be realistically limited in duration,
                            extent of U.S. troop involvement, or publicity.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> has repeatedly
                            made clear that he would oppose any intervention of U.S. ground forces
                            in the war in his country. In undertaking an operation which could not
                            (as in the case of Prairie Fire operations) be concealed from him and
                            from the world, we would risk a strong public reaction from him.</p>
                        <p>5. The proposed operation into Laos would be widely judged to constitute
                            escalation of the war in Vietnam. We would be accused of bad faith at a
                            time when we are seeking to get negotiations going. We would also be
                            accused of violating the neutrality of Laos. In the U.S., the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in world capitals, there would be
                            questions and accusations for which we would lack plausible answers.</p>
                        <p>Recommended Action: That you withhold concurrence in the proposed
                            “expansion” of Prairie Fire operations in the Ashau Valley.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>When the President gave orders to suspend air strikes north of the 20th
                            parallel in North Vietnam, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna Phouma</persName> of Laos was told that this limitation
                            would not have a serious effect on the military situation in his country
                            because additional air power, used until then in the North, would
                            probably be used in Laos—and that, in any case, no policy change was
                            contemplated as regards air operations in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Then came Hanoi's allegation of an attack on Lai Chau, in North Vietnam.
                            Since it was possible that that attack might have been related to U.S.
                            air operations in Laos, the President issued an order that operations in
                            Northern Laos along the North Vietnamese border be more effectively
                            controlled. As a result, operations in the entire Barrel Roll area have
                            been temporarily suspended.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, it turned out that Lai Chau could not have been attacked by
                            U.S. planes. Improved controls were promptly worked out to make any
                            strikes across the Lao border even less possible. Our Embassy in
                            Vientiane worked out such measures with Seventh Air Force and
                            recommended on April 13 that strikes in the Barrel Roll area be
                            authorized again. Our good faith vis-a-vis the Lao Government is
                            involved. Strikes in the Barrel Roll area are very important to the Lao
                            Armed Forces in view of friendly guerrilla assets there and North
                            Vietnamese road traffic feeding into other areas.</p>
                        <p>State, Defense and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> are agreed to
                            reinstitute strikes (carefully controlled) in the two southern segments
                            (Bravo and Coco) of the Barrel Roll area, but to retain temporarily the
                            suspension for the Alpha zone which is strategically less important and
                            closer to Communist China. General <persName corresp="#p_WGEG1">Wheeler</persName> had intended to discuss this matter with the
                            President in Honolulu, but had been unable to do so. An early decision
                            is very desirable.</p>

                        <p>A luncheon meeting held at the White House on April 23, 1968, from 2:15
                            to 3 p.m. with President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>,

                            Tom Johnson attending, discussed Vietnam. As part of these
                            deliberations, the question of operations in base 607 in Laos was
                            discussed. According to Tom Johnson's notes, the discussion on the
                            proposed operation into Laos went as follows:</p>
                        <p>“The problem of entering base area 607 in Laos was discussed.</p>

                                Interdepartmental Review Group.” The Department told the Embassy
                                that it realized that it had covered this ground before, but wished
                                the assessment to concentrate on the political consequences of
                                alternative policies. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Any assessment of U.S. policy with respect to Laos must start from an
                            assessment of the commitments and obligations which the U.S. <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0735"/>is willing to undertake towards Laos.
                            If the U.S. were willing to underwrite the political and territorial
                            integrity of Laos as we have done for Thailand and the Philippines, we
                            would be faced in Laos with an overt challenge to our self-declared
                            national interests and would presumably be required to react by overt
                            deployment of U.S. forces. If, on the other hand, our commitment is
                            decidedly hedged and deliberately obscure, then our reaction to events
                            in Laos has to be less precise, less overt, and less conventional.</p>
                        <p>2. A second consideration with respect to Laos must be our understanding
                            about the source of the trouble in Laos. It should be clear to all that
                            the troubles are not indigenous, but stem from North Vietnam. The most
                            direct, effective, and decisive attack on the problems of Laos should in
                            practice be an attack against North Vietnam. If a decision were made
                            that we should resolve our difficulties in Laos by purely military means
                            without regard to the political consequences, then I would unreservedly
                            recommend that we invade North Vietnam, invest its terrain, and strangle
                            its military potential to operate in and against Laos.</p>
                        <p>3. A third basic consideration should embrace an understanding of the
                            strategic significance of Lao territory to U.S. interests in Southeast
                            Asia. This significance is partly in relationship to Lao territory as a
                            buffer in protection of Thailand, and partly in relationship to Lao
                            territory as a buffer (or conversely a threat) to South Vietnam. It is
                            hard to assess which of these relationships is the more significant to
                            U.S. long term interests, as distinct from immediate interests of a
                            tactical nature. However, if I were required to make a choice, I would
                            opt for the protection of Thailand as being the more important. This is
                            not to say that I believe we have to consider these matters as
                            alternatives, since our policy should be directed towards preserving
                            both elements of our interest. However, it is a way of saying that we
                            should not sacrifice a long term strategic interest for a short term
                            tactical objective.</p>
                        <p>4. Having stated these premises, it then becomes important to know
                            something about the nature of the Lao state. Laos is an agglomeration of
                            territories, families, interests, and personalities which, taken
                            together, fulfill the geographical expression of statehood. However, the
                            state does not articulate through a central, linear system of controls
                            but rather through the inspiration of a series of ganglia-like control
                            centers which have to be stimulated simultaneously and in the same
                            direction. If the sequence of stimulation is not simultaneous, or if the
                            directions do not coincide, the agglomeration could disintegrate into
                            separate geographic, political and ideological entities. These would
                            become subject to external manipulation and each would contain, in
                            multiplicity, the same problems and divisions which currently beset the
                            state as a whole. This would mean three, or possibly four, political
                            creatures, each requiring a different and competitive degree of
                            commitment and none of them <pb n="704" xml:id="pg_704" facs="0736"/>providing the strategic buffer protection for neighboring territories.
                            We went this route once before in 1959–61 with disastrous
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>5. By application of these several considerations and experiences, we
                            have come to the conclusion that the form and framework which is most
                            feasible for us to obtain (given the limitations on the commitments we
                            are willing to make) is the sort of Lao state envisaged by the Geneva
                            Agreements of 1962. In a larger geopolitical sense, those agreements are
                            important because they incorporate a tacit U.S.-Soviet agreement to
                            collaborate in the support of independent, non-Communist states on the
                            southern flank of China as a means to contain the southward thrust of
                            the thoughts of Mao Tse-tung. This same tacit collaboration exists in
                            such forms as the Dept schedules for Indonesia, the mutual provision of
                            arms to India, the Tashkent agreements on the sub-continent, etc. But,
                            nowhere else is it incorporated in a formal document except in the case
                            of Laos.</p>
                        <p>6. Therefore, the first conclusion which I would like to see established
                            in your assessment is the fact that the 1962 Geneva Agreements, as
                            written and signed, constitute the basic desideratum of our policy with
                            respect to Laos and that it is [not?] in our national interests to see
                            these agreements being “exploited” by anyone. (If any nation has been
                            able to “exploit” them successfully, it is the United States.) It is,
                            however, a very clear and precise question of the agreements being
                            violated by North Vietnam. If you can agree on this fundamental, then
                            you can go on to a successful assessment of U.S. policy re Laos. If you
                            can not agree on this point, then I would suggest you scrap the whole
                            project right there and kick it upstairs, because anything other than
                            this is moonbeams.</p>
                        <p>7. The central problem facing you, therefore, should be the question of
                            how to obtain enforcement of the 1962 agreements. It should be agreed
                            that the primary violator of the agreements is North Vietnam, egged on
                            by the ChiComs. It should then be understood, however, that the Poles,
                            supported by the Russians, are also violators, because of their default
                            in observance of the protocol governing <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> matters. It should then, finally, be understood that
                            the Geneva Agreements do not govern the internal structure of the Lao
                            Government, do not underwrite the status of the Pathet Lao, and do not
                            sanctify a tripartite coalition government. Those actions were all Lao
                            national actions as distinct from international actions. Our attention
                            therefore should be focused on the problem of requiring (a) the
                            withdrawal of North Vietnamese forces from Laos, and (b) the active
                            participation of the Poles in the functioning of the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>8. At this stage, it should be realistically understood that it is
                            nonsense to consider Laos in a vacuum, and that it can really be
                            discussed only in relation to Vietnam. (At this stage, some of the more
                            astute participants in the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> exercise
                            may become aware that this whole <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>
                            “reassessment” <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0737"/>is consequently
                            nonsense.) Therefore, in determining what we can do to achieve 7 (a)
                            above, we have to relate our abilities and our will to that which we are
                            prepared to do in order to achieve success in Vietnam. If we are
                            prepared to use that military force necessary to invade, invest, and
                            defeat North Vietnam on its home territory, then, presto, we will have
                            solved the problem of North Vietnamese troops in Laos. If we are not
                            prepared to use that degree of force, then we have to consider other
                            methods.</p>
                        <p>9. One such method often proposed is the introduction of U.S. and/or
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> ground forces into the area of
                            the Ho Chi Minh Trail to invest that terrain and therefore drive the
                            North Vietnamese out of Laos. This is the hard way. In fact, it is about
                            the hardest way that could be devised. Le Duan, Secy Gen of the Lao Dong
                            Party, has examined this prospect and written about it. He has concluded
                            that even Americans wouldn't be so obtuse as to try this system. It
                            would require, he points out, that the U.S. first seize control of the
                            Do Xa and the western highlands of South Vietnam. (We have never yet had
                            adequate troops to do this.) It would next require a major logistics
                            effort into the trail area. Then it would require a few divisions of
                            troops to be sustained in that area against the threat of massive,
                            concentrated attacks by regular North Vietnamese forces who will be able
                            to attack from short lines of communications in terrain which they know
                            and which favors them. The military picture Le Duan paints is that of a
                            series of Con Thiens and Khe Sanhs along the southwest border of North
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>10. While I don't wish to hold up Le Duan or <persName corresp="#p_Giap1">Giap</persName> as military experts superior to some of our own
                            deep thinkers on these matters, I would submit that their experience is
                            enough to credit them with the description of a military threat which
                            would require at least 206,000 additional U.S. troops to encounter. I
                            would also note that Le Duan goes on to comment on possibility that the
                            U.S. might eschew a major action like this and choose to attack with
                            lesser units. He says “If a small force is used the problem remains
                            insoluble.” He goes on to add that “The U.S. will be severely condemned
                            by people all over the world and the anti-U.S. movement will turn out to
                            be stronger.” If he knew the U.S. Senate better, he might have added a
                            few gems about its reaction as well.</p>
                        <p>11. In short, we do not have the will to make the only military move
                            which would be effective (invasion of North Vietnam). We do not have the
                            means to make a military move which, at great cost, might prove
                            significant. The only military means we have could achieve very little
                            of lasting effectiveness, and would predictably do that at a political
                            cost which would further erode the will and the support which remains
                            for other military operations elsewhere in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>12. These considerations really address only the immediate local military
                            problem. As such, they are serious enough. However, they pale <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0738"/>beside the indirect military
                            consequences and the political results. The indirect political
                            consequences would involve North Vietnamese (and possibly ChiCom) action
                            to exploit in north and central Laos the fact of the immense forces
                            which we would tie down in southern Laos, this in turn would bring into
                            play the whole question of Laos as a buffer to Thailand and our
                            commitments to Thailand. We would probably be called on to deploy at
                            least one (and probably two) divisions to Thailand for the latter's
                            protection. Moreover, since Souvanna would quit Laos, the country (as
                            described in para 4 above) would break up into smaller units, at least
                            two of which would predictably ask us for other troops to protect them
                            (say, about four more regiments, with associated air power). We could
                            elaborate the nightmare further by citing the probable consequences in
                            relation to the Soviets. With Souvanna gone and a Pathet Lao “Liberation
                            Front Government” emerging in at least a portion of Lao territory, we
                            could expect the Soviets to withdraw recognition from whatever political
                            group replaces Souvanna in Vientiane and transfer their support (both
                            political and material) to the Pathet Lao. This could only be considered
                            a step backward in the Southeast Asia situation as a whole.</p>
                        <p>13. It therefore becomes quite clear that the framework in which we have
                            to operate with respect to removing the NVN from Laos is the framework
                            established by the President's March 31 speech,<note n="3" xml:id="d359fn3">The speech in which <persName>Johnson</persName>
                                announced his decision not to seek reelection. Text in <hi rend="italic">Public Papers of the Presidents of the United

                            looks towards military de-escalation and a political settlement. The
                            occasions for the introduction of the Lao problem into this framework
                            are myriad, and will begin with the very first contact. If, as Hanoi
                            insists, we are to establish arrangements for the total cessation of
                            bombing over North Vietnam, then we must insist upon some reciprocity
                            and a system to enforce reciprocity. The establishment of <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> teams on the passes leading into the Ho
                            Chi Minh Trail in Laos would assure us whether or not that trail was
                            being used by trucks, since the passes are few and well known. If we can
                            expand this to include all other known logistics routes into Laos, then
                            we would assure observation and control of all the means which sustain
                            and support the NVN in Laos (they do not live off the country). This
                            would mean that the NVN supply system would disappear and they would
                            have to bring their troops home. This is obviously the cleanest, the
                            most logical (and most typically <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>)
                            solution. If the North Vietnamese badly enough want the bombing stopped
                            and are prepared to give up the war, this way would be ideal because it
                            would involve [”]invisible reciprocity.” Hanoi denies there are North
                            Vietnamese in Laos; hence an <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            presence would be no formal embarrassment to them.</p>
                        <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0739"/>
                        <p>14. Another way, short of bargaining for this reciprocity, would be for
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, by majority vote, to move out
                            onto the Ho Chi Minh Trail and other areas of interest in Laos. This
                            could be done if the Indian and Canadian members were willing to take
                            the physical chances inherent in this move. I rate the chances for this
                            as quite limited, but given Dr. Barnard's success with heart transplant
                            cases, perhaps we could get him to try a spinal transplant into some
                            pliant Indian bodies, using the ramrod vertebral columns of some of the
                            more unbending warriors in the Pentagon.</p>
                        <p>15. Still a third way is to achieve a change of heart in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            co-chairmen, especially the latter. It is not clear that Soviets would
                            ever be able to influence Hanoi strongly enough to change the latter's
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>However, if Soviets were willing pay a great deal to support North
                            Vietnam, if they would be willing protect it against ChiCom subversion,
                            and if they were willing to muscle a pro-Soviet Government into power in
                            Hanoi, they might be able to achieve our objective for us. Only way I
                            can conceive of this happening would be in exchange for our giving them
                            something very dear to their hearts—West Germany, for instance. The
                            disproportions here are obviously ludicrous, but I am merely suggesting
                            some parameters for IRG consideration.</p>
                        <p>16. Fundamentally, I conclude (and assume <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> will also) that the maneuvering room re Laos is quite
                            limited. There are many of the old pressure points that we can
                            re-invigorate, such as London, Moscow, Delhi, etc. There may be a few
                            new ones we can devise in the old context, but I would doubt their
                            efficacy in obtaining genuine results.</p>
                        <p>17. In my judgement, the major new opportunity for action re Laos arises
                            from Hanoi's new-found willingness to move to the conference table. No
                            matter how they disguise this it is still a retreat from their previous
                            cocksure ambition of winning the war militarily. Therefore, it seems to
                            me that the best, positive contribution the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> can make at this time is to examine realistically where
                            Laos should fit into the negotiating picture, what elements of
                            satisfaction can be derived from Laos from these negotiations, how those
                            elements rate with respect to our objectives in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> (pretty high, I would judge) and which other nations
                            can be called on to help out in this process. The need for this sort of
                            judgement is real and not academic.</p>

                                April 24, the Department informed the Embassy of the President's
                                approval of employment of Prairie Fire forces up to battalion size
                                and estimated that the operation on Lao soil would last from 4 to 6
                                days. The Department then asked the Embassy for specific
                                recommendations, which are described and answered in this cable.

                        <p>1. Reftel advises that highest level has authorized Haymaker operation,
                            in Base Area 607 and asks my views about handling with Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>2. As far as discussion in advance with Souvanna, answer is categorically
                            negative. He would have to oppose it, possibly in public. We would then
                            have to reconsider, or else defy his sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>3. I am relieved that policy will be to “refrain from all U.S. official
                            comment,” but I share your doubts that this will work. Therefore, assume
                            there will be leaks which will have to be handled in some fashion.
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> has directed that there be “No
                            admission that forces have crossed the border.” This is a good, sound
                            and simple directive and I hope we can stand on it.</p>
                        <p>4. In the contingency that some superior conscience feels an “admission”
                            has to be made, I would foresee various complications:</p>
                        <p>(A) Souvanna would ask for an explanation privately, and would be
                            harassed both by press and by unfriendly diplomats for public expression
                            of disapproval. If level of public evidence is high enough, he will have
                            to make a protest.</p>
                        <p>(B) Our explanation, if we have to give one, should be based on “swirl of
                            battle” and vagueness of frontiers in Thai area. Fact that battlefield
                            extends across border would have to be an unstated, but evident,
                            presupposition.</p>
                        <p>(C) Possibility might arise, in light 4 (A) above, that we might also
                            have to make a public apology. If so, and for consistency's sake, it
                            also should be based on “swirl of battle” concept.</p>
                        <p>(D) Fact is that Haymaker Battalion will consist of 540 Vietnamese
                            nationals accompanied by only 50 U.S. advisers. Hence, border violation
                            will in essence be Vietnamese, although it is questionable whether
                                <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> would even be aware that this
                            particular <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss>-controlled group is
                            involved. Nevertheless, if all gory details eke out, it might also
                            become incumbent upon <gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> (as in 4 (C)
                            above) to associate itself with any apology. <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0741"/>This is one bridge I feel we should cross only when and
                            if we come to it. Otherwise chances of leakage are multiplied. In any
                            event, Tran Van Do would probably feel no qualms about making an apology
                            to his old friend and classmate Souvanna.</p>
                        <p>5. In general, it is obvious that best hope is to conduct operation
                            without press detection. In case of detection, steadfast “no comment”
                            and “no admission” are best line of defense. If this line is to be
                            breached, request full interchange among Washington, Saigon and
                            Vientiane before any other press line is taken. I do not believe it
                            would be useful to attempt develop a contingency line in advance.</p>

                            April 23, Souvanna indicated his strong desire for continuing US air
                            strikes on the major access routes into north Laos from North Vietnam,
                            in particular routes 7, 6, 65, and 19, as well as nearby storage
                            points.</p>
                        <p>Current intelligence indicates that there is a considerable NVN build-up,
                            including daylight truck movement, along these lines of communication
                                <pb n="710" xml:id="pg_710" facs="0742"/>inside Laos which now enjoy
                            immunity from US air attack. In Area Bravo, 215 of 228 carefully
                            selected targets validated by Lao authorities for US air strikes in Area
                            Bravo now lie outside the authorized zone, i.e., east of 104 degrees. In
                            particular, the huge enemy cave and storage complex near Sam Neua which
                            was specifically authorized by Souvanna in March cannot now be struck.
                            Also east of 104 degrees in the Bravo area are several important <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>-supported <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> guerrilla outposts which normally count on US air
                            strikes to assist in their defense. In Area Alpha, Route 19 from Dien
                            Bien Phu into north Laos is now spared from interdiction and several
                            more <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> guerrilla bases in that region
                            are consequently menaced by the movement of enemy troops and supplies
                            over this road.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> has suggested
                            that either of two further modifications would enable us to respond
                            positively to Souvanna's request and to meet both US and Lao needs in
                            Alpha and Bravo areas:</p>
                        <p>a. Authorize strikes under strict controls in all portions of the Barrel
                            Roll area except a 10 nautical mile strip on the Lao side of the NVN
                            border, or</p>
                        <p>b. Authorize strikes in Bravo area west of 104 degrees 15' (instead of
                            104 degrees) east longitude (to include the Sam Neua storage complex),
                            and in Alpha area along route 19 up to 10 nautical miles of the NVN
                            border.</p>
                        <p>We believe Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s
                            request takes into account the need for controls to prevent inadvertent
                            strikes into North Vietnam, and we support either of the proposed
                            modifications of the current restrictions. In addition to the geographic
                            limits, several other controls are in effect to prevent the possibility
                            of strikes into North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you arrange to have this matter re-opened with the
                            President next week at the Tuesday lunch and seek the President's
                            approval for loosening of present restrictions in accordance with
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s
                                request.<note n="3" xml:id="d361fn3">At the luncheon meeting on

                                the issue was discussed. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                                stated, “The boys in Laos want us to extend bombing east.” The
                                President asked, “Is <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>
                                worried?” <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied, “He is
                                for it.” <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> added that,
                                    “<persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> favors
                                alternative A. We prefer alternative B to hit area in Laos.” Helms
                                then noted, “A is ten miles from 20th [parallel]. B is 15 miles from
                                20th.” The President stated, “Let's take out B now. See how it
                                looks.” (Johnson Library, Tom Johnson Meeting Notes, 4/30/68)</note>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Thank you for your letter of March 23<note n="2" xml:id="d362fn2">
                                <ref target="#d348">Document 348</ref>.</note> in which you asked
                            for our comments and assessment of the contingency study which
                            accompanied your letter. I have had the appropriate members of the staff
                            go over the study and our collective views follow.</p>
                        <p>We all agree that the study is very well-organized, covers the essential
                            points and is a reasonable and realistic assessment of the situation.
                            This is all the more remarkable considering the pressure upon you and
                            the haste with which it must have been put together.</p>
                        <p>We all share your dismay over the dismal state of the US military
                            capability to react to a “Drang nach Western.” Nor are the prospects for
                            enhanced capability encouraging. This plight of the military places even
                            greater premium upon the political restraints currently operating to
                            keep the Lao situation on reasonably even keel and should, therefore,
                            make us all even more sensitive than heretofore to the serious damage
                            that removing these political restraints would eventually entail.</p>
                        <p>Concomitantly, overt U.S. military operations in Laos would carry with
                            them an undeniable US commitment to Laos—we would commit our prestige to
                            the protection of all of Laos once having openly sent troops into the
                            country. The advantage of our military posture in Laos today is that,
                            were it to be unfortunately necessary, we could fold our tents and fade
                            quietly away, for we have made no overt military commitment. These are
                            the major points that I wish to make with respect to the study and ones
                            that I trust will be constantly borne in mind by our top policy-makers
                            when they are repeatedly badgered to acquiesce in seemingly simple US
                            military operations in Laos.</p>
                        <p>Our remaining comments are keyed to the order of your study. With regard
                            to your first assumption, we question whether the small forces
                            maneuvering in open country would be highly vulnerable to air power. We
                            think that these forces would undoubtedly move at night for the most
                            part and we doubt that we could do them much damage, even with several
                            squadrons of Sopwith-Camels all piloted by Red Barons.</p>
                        <p>You are right when you say that the US has no defense commitments to
                            Laos. The Lao, however, regard the Geneva Accords as a vehicle for <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0744"/>their protection, and in the
                            event of a violation or threat of extinction, Laos would look to the
                            signatory nations to honor their commitment to maintain Lao sovereignty,
                            etc. Souvanna has made this point to us many times. As you recall, when
                            Souvanna was asked not too long ago (when the NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> seemed to be really pushing) whether in appealing to
                            signatory nations he was not in fact asking for troops, he replied that
                            the manner in which the signatory nations fulfilled their obligations
                            was their affair.</p>
                        <p>Our reasoning is that if the enemy were to violate the Geneva Accords in
                            a manner to threaten Laos' survival, Souvanna would press hard within
                            the Accords for meaningful Article 4 action. He would look to us
                            primarily—and in light of our stated policy and interests, we would have
                            to conjure up some sort of reply. Given the prevailing military
                            situation, it seems that we would have to rely essentially upon
                            political/psychological measures. If we failed and Laos were about to go
                            under, we think that then and only then would Souvanna resign—as
                            admission that the Geneva Accords upon which he had staked his basic
                            policy were ineffective. But we do think that he would remain in place
                            and play out the Accords to the end. This view differs in emphasis from
                            that expressed in the last two full paragraphs on page 3 of the study
                            regarding probable Souvanna actions. (We would expect Laos also to
                            engage in a series of bilateral efforts to extricate itself—<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Thailand—in addition to the
                            multi-national approach, but with little if any positive result.)</p>
                        <p>You have my 5692 regarding covert and overt use of Thai air assets.<note n="3" xml:id="d362fn3">Dated April 8. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, POL 27 LAOS)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>With respect to US military actions which might have some psychological
                            value in the event Hanoi goes hog-wild, we like to keep the possibility
                            of an invasion of North Vietnam dangling before military eyes—either as
                            a real threat, or as a bargaining counter which brings them to the
                            table.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I think that we all ought to recognize flatly that project 22
                            exists on paper only. Your study mentioned that many of the Thai units
                            destined for this project do not even exist. We might just as well
                            confess that the US forces of 138,440 “committed” to the project do not
                            exist either—therefore, no Project 22. Moreover, since it has recently
                            been compromised, I think it ought to be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>Of course, all these considerations may be altered in the next few weeks
                            if we really get down to serious negotiations. At that stage, I think,
                            as I have suggested to the <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>, that
                            your efforts are better expended on relating Laos to the negotiating
                            picture and seeing what advantages can be drawn from the strengths of
                            the position we do have here, rather than reinforcing our weaknesses.
                            That should be a truly educational exercise for the Pentagon and,
                            perhaps, the White House.</p>

                        <p>We hang on bated breath to hear whether it's true about you replacing

                        <p>The North Vietnamese are engaged in an intensive program to construct new
                            supply routes, with limited all-weather capability, into South Vietnam
                            from Laotian trunk routes to support military operations (see the map,
                            Figure 1). Work started on a number of new roads during the last quarter
                            of 1967, prior to the Tet offensive, and is still in progress. All of
                            these new roads branch off a north-south trunk route in the Laotian
                            Panhandle and run directly across the border toward important US-South
                            Vietnamese military installations in South Vietnam. The newly completed
                            routes provide the Communists with an increased capability to introduce
                            troops, heavy weapons, and sizable amounts of materials by truck into
                            four widely separated areas in the northern part of South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>North Vietnamese strategy provides for connecting their road network in
                            North Vietnam and Laos with the existing road system in South <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0746"/>Vietnam. To achieve this goal,
                            the North Vietnamese have simultaneously built or upgraded five new
                            crossings of the South Vietnamese border (a total of 215 miles of road)
                            during the past six months. Two of the new roads parallel Route 9 in
                            Laos and lead toward the Khe Sanh Combat Base. Further south, a road in
                            Laos has been connected with a road in the A Shau Valley in South
                            Vietnam leading to Hue. The North Vietnamese have joined a fourth road
                            with an important north-south route in South Vietnam. From the
                            tri-border area of Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam, the North
                            Vietnamese have also extended a new road to the vicinity of the major US
                            base at Dak To. New feeder roads branch off this route and lead
                            southeast towards the provincial capitals of Kontum and Pleiku.</p>
                        <p>The new and expanded roadnet is an attempt to establish a more reliable
                            year-round logistics system. All the new roads crossing into South
                            Vietnam, except the two roads paralleling Route 9 in Laos, are limited
                            all-weather; all connect with logistical base areas along the main trunk
                            route. Sections of the main north-south route in Laos, and especially
                            the segment north of Chavane, at times become impassable during the
                            rainy season, but the enemy may be able to maintain most of this primary
                            logistical route for a longer period this year than in previous ones. In
                            addition, a new road which appears to have limited all-weather
                            capability is under construction from North Vietnam around the western

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_MGA1">Martin</persName>:</p>
                        <p>I was just about to answer your letter of April 24<note n="2" xml:id="d364fn2">Not found.</note> when I received <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName>'s message to Wheeler
                            advising him that he had decided to cancel the Haymaker aspect of
                            Operation Delaware. Although the reasons <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0747"/>attributed to this move reflect the possibility to
                            leakage to the press, I would guess that another aspect is the fact that
                            there currently appears to be very little enemy presence in the area
                            where the operation was intended.</p>
                        <p>I don't think, from this development, that we have seen the last of
                            Haymakers, because I suspect that an effort will be made to launch a
                            similar operation into some other more promising base area. Now that the
                            principle has been established I am sure that <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> will not fail to exploit this possibility.<note n="3" xml:id="d364fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HMF1">Herz</persName> wrote the following
                                marginal note at this point: “Yes, but the principle that you can't
                                keep it secret, which was a condition for approval, has been
                                established.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>As you point out in your letter, I did not submit any specific comments
                            on the <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> proposal for Operation
                            Delaware. My decision to take this course was based on a number of
                            considerations. First, the Haymaker conception, which is a considerable
                            retreat from Southpaw and York, brought into action forces which have
                            already demonstrated their ability to operate in Laos without press
                            leakage. Secondly, the move was contrived in such a way that it could be
                            described entirely in terms of action to be taken for the protection of
                            United States forces on the A Shau battlefield. Thirdly, it was within
                            the framework (Prairie Fire) which Oley Sharp, Westie and I had agreed
                            in our last <gloss target="#t_SEACOORD1">SEACOORD</gloss> meeting might
                            be the only tolerable arrangement to which I could give
                                concurrence.<note n="4" xml:id="d364fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_HMF1">Herz</persName> at this point wrote,
                                “this is new.”</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, I placed my entire considerations on the question of the
                            relationship of this proposed action to the President's de-escalation
                            policy. The Air Force has been so nervous about air operations in the
                            north of Laos which might impinge on that policy that I was frankly
                            somewhat surprised when approval for Haymaker was given quite so
                            rapidly. However, I suppose it reflects the President's annoyance that
                            North Vietnamese infiltration efforts have apparently stepped up rather
                            than relaxed since the March 31 speech.</p>
                        <p>There have been some communications back and forth between <persName corresp="#p_WGWC1">Westmoreland</persName> and myself on this whole
                            subject which have not been repeated to Washington. I think that it is
                            probably best that they remain in this category for the sake of mutual
                            good faith and continued collaboration. On the whole, however, I think
                            you on the desk and we in the field have remained very much on the same
                            wave length and I appreciate all that you have done to hold the line. As
                            we move into the successively more complex period of negotiating while
                            fighting, I think this sort of entente becomes even more important.
                            Especially, I believe it is going to become important for us all to have
                            our facts and our intelligence straight before making decisions. I have
                            recently sent in a cable expressing some <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0748"/>skepticism about the infiltration figures projected
                            from North into South Viet Nam during the rainy season.<note n="5" xml:id="d364fn5">At this point Herz asked, “GMG [<persName corresp="#p_GGMM1">Godley</persName>] wasn't it No Distribution
                                Outside Dept?”</note> This will doubtless cause some consternation
                            in <gloss target="#t_DIA1">DIA</gloss> and elsewhere, but I feel it
                            would be very useful for you to bring it to the attention of
                                <persName>Bundy</persName>, Katzenbach, and the Secretary<note n="6" xml:id="d364fn6">At this point <persName corresp="#p_HMF1">Herz</persName> wrote the following: “Note: Message was almost
                                two weeks old by time this arrived; was superceded by a much better
                                (exdis/no distribution outside Dept.) message on the same subject;
                                as GMG said <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> is sure we're not
                                being spoofed; so did not distribute further.”</note> as the sort of
                            thing we must be absolutely sure about when we make political and
                            military decisions in the near future. We must remember that the North
                            Vietnamese are perfectly capable of running deception operations and
                            that our military intelligence system is so attuned that it vibrates
                            violently in response to such deceptions.</p>
                        <p>For the moment then all is well that ends well on Haymaker. But for the
                            future, I think a little more careful questioning of intelligence
                            premises and the alleged facts needs to be done by our State Department
                            sources whenever they are called upon to make decisions of this
                            dimension.</p>

                                reported on Souvanna's meeting with Lao generals at Luang Prabang to

                                    <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> and Souvanna on
                                the same subject. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Souvanna told me Saturday<note n="3" xml:id="d365fn3">May 4.</note>
                            evening that he had finally signed the degree reorganizing the Ministry
                            of Defense and the General Staff. <pb n="717" xml:id="pg_717" facs="0749"/>He said that, after a month of haggling, the generals
                            seemed satisfied with the new plan.</p>
                        <p>2. As predicted Ref B, the plan falls far short of Souvanna's original
                            intentions, but it is at least a step in the right direction. It
                            preserves the “one man, one job” principle by abolishing both deputy
                            C-in-C spots formerly held by <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kouprasith</persName> and Bounpone, making them respectively
                            commanders of fifth and third military regions. It also abolishes the
                            north and south tactical headquarters, as well as the Groupes
                            Mobiles.</p>
                        <p>3. The Ministry of Defense, instead of being placed under direction of a
                            weak general such as Bounleut, will remain (at least for now) in the
                            hands of the colonels. Thongphanh will be asked to act in lieu of a
                            director general and Souvanna has asked him to move six or eight “good
                            colonels” out of the General Staff to head the new functional divisions
                            being removed from the General Staff and transferred into <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Souvanna said his next problem was to remove several generals who were
                            useless and get them retired by one means or another. There might also
                            be some colonels in this category. He had asked Quan to draw up an
                            “execution list” of those who should disappear. After he got rid of
                            these, he proposed to promote some of the “good colonels” to
                            generals.</p>
                        <p>5. I told Souvanna that I thought his next serious problem was the Air
                            Force, particularly the transport aircraft which were being used for
                            smuggling and private commerce. He agreed and said that he had caught
                            Bounpone red-handed in the latest smuggling effort to Saigon. I said
                            Sourith seemed honest but not strong enough to control the senior
                            generals. Souvanna again agreed and said he was thinking of putting the
                            Air Force directly under the Ministry rather than the General Staff. I
                            said I thought that would be pretty difficult for tactical air, since
                            the I–28s had to be handled by the officers in charge of operations.
                            However, I saw no reason why transport aircraft couldn't be brought
                            under direct control of the new logistics section of the <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss>. He said he would look into that
                            approach.</p>
                        <p>6. We have other information being reported separately which indicates
                            that long-standing problem of integrated ranks for neutralist officers
                            has also been agreed and forwarded to the King. If King accepts this
                            proposal, this will resolve another nettlesome issue.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName>Paul</persName>:</p>
                        <p>In answer to your letter of April 13,<note n="2" xml:id="d366fn2">In an
                                April 13 letter to Katzenbach, <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> stated that he knew Katzenbach shared his
                                concern over the deteriorating situation in Laos. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> reported that he supported a
                                    <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendation for a broader
                                effort (than the contingency study) to reassess U.S. policy for Laos
                                in the Interdepartmental Regional Group/East Asia. According to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, “the primary
                                purpose of the reassessment would be to identify means by which
                                international support might be obtained for the elimination of North
                                Vietnamese exploitation of the Geneva Agreements and to consider
                                alternatives that might offer better prospects of promoting U.S.
                                interests.” (Department of State, Pol 27 (LAOS)</note> we will be
                            pleased to undertake a reassessment of U.S. policy for Laos by the
                            Interdepartmental Regional Group/East Asia. I would suggest one change
                            in the purpose of the exercise as stated in your letter: the Geneva
                            Agreements have not been “exploited” but rather consistently violated by
                            the North Vietnamese in the most blatant manner. I presume that North
                            Vietnamese “violation” rather than “exploitation” was meant, and we are
                            proceeding to set up the policy review on that basis.</p>

                        <p>In the approximately six weeks since our Contingency Study was approved,
                            there has been no major enemy attack in Laos. The <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> has continued to apply pressure not
                            only in South Laos around the provincial capitals of Saravane and
                            Attopeu, but also around Thakhek on the Mekong in Central Laos and
                            against guerrilla posts in north Laos. It has taken only a few minor
                            friendly positions, for example Lahanam in southern Savannakhet province
                            on April 13, and such successes were not the result of major military
                            operations. The <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> still retains the
                            capability to overrun much of Laos, but the approaching rainy season
                            will soon limit the magnitude and speed of a possible new <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> offensive.</p>

                            Utilization in Laos</p>
                        <p>Consultations were begun with our Embassies in Vientiane and Bangkok
                            about the possible utilization of Thai T–28's (either “sheep-dipped” or
                            overt) and additional deployment of US air assets to Thailand.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in Vientiane
                            believes that the political disadvantages would greatly outweigh the
                            marginal military advantages of overt use of the Thai air force in Laos.
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] he considers it preferable to augment the number
                            of “Class B” pilots (Thai pilots flying <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> aircraft under control of our Air Attache in
                            Vientiane). A much more significant increase of tactical deterrent air
                            strength will result from the contemplated expansion of US air resources
                            in Thailand, particularly in propeller planes which seem best adapted to
                            operations in Laos. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_UL1">Unger</persName> in Bangkok believes that there would be no Thai
                            political objections to the increase of US aircraft in Thailand if the
                            purpose is to shore up the defense of Laos. This finding should help in
                            speeding up deployment of additional tactical prop-aircraft to Thailand,
                            though they could not be there in time to help counter an enemy
                            offensive in Laos should one occur before the advent of the rains later
                            this month.</p>

                        <p>On December 30 and February 29 <persName corresp="#p_SPP1">Souvanna
                                Phouma</persName> wrote to the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference
                            denouncing the North Vietnamese attacks in Laos and calling for
                            consultations among the signatories under Article 4 of the 1962 Geneva
                            Agreement. In March the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> suggested <pb n="720" xml:id="pg_720" facs="0752"/>to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> that the Co-Chairmen circulate both letters along with
                            a joint message for which they submitted a draft. Since the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> has not replied, the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> at our urging has now finally decided to
                            circulate both of Souvanna's letters unilaterally on May 6.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">IV. <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>
                            Activity</p>
                        <p>1. The February 21 <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> “visit” to
                            Saravane (which may have played some role in restraining the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> in South Laos) was followed by a visit
                            of the Indian Chairman and the Canadian Commissioner on April 12–13 to
                            Attopeu, Saravane and Lao Ngam. The Polish Commissioner again declined
                            to join his colleagues. Although a mortar attack on Attopeu occurred
                            while the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> visit was taking place
                            there, it is possible that the increased <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss> activity may have some deterrent effect on Hanoi. At
                            any rate, it helps to buck up Lao morale. We can claim no credit for the
                            more positive Indian attitude in the <gloss target="#t_ICC1">ICC</gloss>, which seems due largely to the personality of the new
                            Indian Commissioner and some tactical gaffes by the Pole, who has now
                            completed his tour of duty and been replaced.</p>
                        <p>2. To encourage the Indians in their forward posture, we have suggested
                            to several governments that New Delhi be encouraged to maintain its
                            present relatively active attitude. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Japan have taken action. France is willing to help,
                            though in a lower key. We do not wish demarches in New Delhi to be too
                            obviously orchestrated, so are still holding in reserve the
                            encouragement of similar diplomatic actions by Germany and Thailand,
                            both of whom are judged to be willing. Australia will weigh in with
                            Prime Minister Gandhi when she visits Canberra in May. We have no
                            illusions that even the cumulative effect of such efforts will have any
                            decisive influence on the Indians, but it may make backsliding more
                            awkward for them.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Laos and US/<gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> Negotiations</p>
                        <p> Souvanna and the King are anxious that US military support for Laos will
                            continue even while we de-escalate in North Vietnam and that Laos should
                            benefit promptly from any lessening of hostilities in South Vietnam. To
                            that end, they are seeking both private and public assurances from us
                            that our negotiations with Hanoi will include a strong requirement that
                            the Geneva Agreements of 1962 should be respected by North Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>The Contingency Study of March 23 implies certain advantages of continued
                            U.S. adherence to the Geneva Agreements of 1962. These may <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0753"/>become more apparent by sketching out
                            some of the actions the enemy continues to be capable of taking in Laos
                            but which he has not yet taken, partly because we have not overtly upset
                            the framework of the Geneva settlement.</p>
                        <p>1. Setting up a rival (“neutralist”) government in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. Obtaining Soviet and Chinese recognition for such a government.</p>
                        <p>3. Raising the specter of Chinese intervention.</p>
                        <p>4. Pushing to the Mekong on a broad, or even limited, front, thus
                            diverting U.S. and Thai troops.</p>
                        <p>5. Pushing to Luang Prabang, thus delivering a major psychological blow
                            to the Lao Government forces.</p>
                        <p>6. Conducting terrorist raids against vulnerable Lao targets.</p>
                        <p>7. Denouncing US/<gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> intervention in the
                            Prairie Fire zone on the basis of hard evidence.</p>
                        <p>8. Exploiting sensitive U.S. operations in Laos, using materials and
                            equipment captured at Site 85 and in the Muscle Shoals area, and
                            aircraft downed in Laos.</p>
                        <p>9. Increasing harassment of U.S. economic as well as military activities
                            in Laos.</p>
                        <p>10. Conducting terrorist raids against U.S. bases in Thailand, such as
                            Nakhon Phanom.</p>
                        <p>If the U.S. were to abandon its formal adherence to and observation of
                            the limitations of the Geneva Agreements of 1962, any inhibitions on the
                            communist side would disappear and the Geneva settlement would collapse
                            entirely; the Royal Lao Government would quickly lose much of the
                            international (including communist and neutral) support which it now
                            enjoys by virtue of its adherence to the Geneva agreements, and leave us
                            as virtually the sole supporter of a no-longer neutral Laos—a costly and
                            diplomatically poor position to be in.</p>
                        <p>We would then have to deal with a government whose area of control was
                            rapidly shrinking and which would have lost the ability to appeal to the
                            Geneva Agreements which had created the basis for its very
                            existence.</p>

                                tactical air operations be stepped up, especially in the area from
                                Paksane north to Xieng Khouang. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. When Souvanna urged yesterday that we intensify our bombing throughout
                            Laos, he volunteered that he knew there were many villages in the area
                            between Paksane and Xieng Khouang, but that it was more important to get
                            on with the job of rooting out the enemy. If some friendly villages were
                            damaged in the process, he went on, “Tant pis! You can't make an omelet
                            without breaking some eggs!”</p>
                        <p>2. While Souvanna in the past has been cold-blooded about civilians in
                            North Vietnam (“bomb the dikes”), I have not before heard him reflect
                            quite such a diet of raw meat regarding his own population. He is
                            undoubtedly feeling pressure from the King who reportedly had adopted a
                            “bomb them wherever they are” attitude toward the enemy, as a means of
                            forcing them out of Laos. Both the King and Souvanna manifest the
                            amateur's overconfidence in the effectiveness of air power.</p>
                        <p>3. Despite Souvanna's statement, I intend to continue the meticulous care
                            and cautious judgment exercised by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> in approving targets within
                            Laos. We shall continue to avoid villages. Nonetheless, I wish to record
                            Souvanna's current position which may prove helpful in the event of a
                            navigational error or a really border-line decision on an important
                            target.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Ref A requested additional views concerning operations in Laos. Ref B
                            provided the <gloss target="#t_CJCS1">CJCS</gloss> with an analysis of
                            the effects of a bombing cessation and informed him of how the air
                            campaign would be organized and managed to enhance our overall
                            operations, including aerial reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p>2. Our current overt and covert military programs in Laos have been
                            reviewed. Any radical change of ground operations in Laos at this time
                            would be counter-productive. Deployment of U.S. ground forces of any
                            significant size into Laos would be particularly undesirable. NVN still
                            has the capability to overrun all of Laos in a matter of days if they
                            choose and a sizeable deployment of US/FWF in Southern Laos might well
                            spark such a reaction. Deployment of even a corps-size force in southern
                            Laos on a permanent basis would not prevent a complete takeover of
                            northern Laos by the NVN.</p>
                        <p>3. The cessation of all bombing and NGF in NVN would permit a sharply
                            accelerated and unimpeded flow of men and supplies into Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, resulting from the release of forces
                            previously occupied in <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> and facility
                            repair and in air and coastal defense. Since we would be deprived of the
                            advantage of striking enemy resources at or near the source, it follows
                            that to compensate for this loss we must increase our operations around
                            the entire perimeter of <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. Although
                            your message addresses only operations in Laos to reduce the flow of men
                            and materiel through that country, we need also to emphasize the
                            restriction of enemy movement through the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, along the <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> coast
                            and through Cambodia.</p>
                        <p>4. The following is a resume of improvements and changes in Laos which
                            would be desirable in event of cessation of all bombing of NVN:</p>
                        <p>A. Cessation of bombing in all of NVN will release presently available
                            assets for intensifying the air war in Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. A comprehensive <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0756"/>and coordinated air effort using the additional
                            resources should further inhibit the use of LOCs and staging areas in
                            Laos. However it must be recognized that during the summer monsoon
                            period visual bombing is largely ineffective in Laos. The following
                            changes to operating rules in Laos are required to optimize the
                            application of these air assets:</p>
                        <p>(1) Authority to attack targets of opportunity when located within 200
                            yards of a motorable road or trail should be expanded to 1,000 yards to
                            provide strike flexibility in Zones II and III of Steel Tiger.</p>
                        <p>(2) <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss>'s are required for strikes
                            outside of the 200 yard limit in Zone II, and within all areas of Zones
                            III and IV and Barrel Roll areas A, B and C. (Strikes may be made in
                            Zone III if under <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> 77 control.) These
                            restrictions should be modified. If not, additional <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> aircraft and personnel will be required
                            to provide control for increased strikes in Laos.</p>
                        <p>B. Improvements in the air supported Muscle Shoals anti-infiltration
                            system can be realized by expanding the area for employing hand emplaced
                            sensors. Presently spike teams are restricted to operations in the
                            Prairie Fire area. Additionally, a reasonable increase of exploitation
                            forces up to battalion size on a case basis should be authorized. This
                            will give the teams greater staying power in the face of enemy
                            opposition and increase the effectiveness of the combined
                            indigenous/special force teams.</p>
                        <p>C. Leaflet drops in Laos should be increased and refined to obtain
                            optimum exploitation of PLA as well as infiltrating <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>D. Employment of <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss>-77 radar bombing
                            should be expanded to ensure all-weather operation. This can be done by
                            locating an <gloss target="#t_MSQ1">MSQ</gloss> facility at Site 98 or
                            other suitable location, to provide coverage over a wider area.</p>
                        <p>E. Comint and ARDF coverage of Laos and NVN should be increased to permit
                            early warning of enemy intentions.</p>
                        <p>F. An additional program for consideration would be to expand guerrilla
                            operations in Laos. <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SOG1">SOG</gloss> has identified the Bru Tribe in the
                            Annamite mountains as having a guerrilla potential.</p>
                        <p>5. The program for advisory and logistical support for <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military units should continue
                            generally in its present scope and an accelerated expansion of the
                            program is not warranted. It will take years of training before <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/FAN forces achieve operational
                            competence. A rapidly expanded program would cause unfavorable political
                            implications, tend to extend U.S. commitments and project a climate of
                            escalation.</p>
                        <p>6. It is important that we continue the reconnaissance of NVN to provide
                            maximum intelligence on movement of men and supplies. Reconnaissance
                            over Laos should be increased to the level necessary to ensure adequate
                            support of stepped up interdiction strikes in that area.</p>
                        <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0757"/>
                        <p>7. Increased authorization is required for intelligence collection in the
                            Laos and Cambodian areas. This is particularly pertinent in Laos where
                            U.S. military is severely restricted by the Geneva Accords. Present
                            restrictions necessitate our operating through third country nationals
                            over whom only limited control or influence can be imposed.</p>

                                (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. It has occurred to me in reviewing history of messages concerning our
                            tactical air problems in Laos that you may not have full background of
                            situation which led to our pleas for augmentation of tactical resources
                            to support our counter-insurgency operations.</p>
                        <p>2. Hard facts are that in past year we have been getting our air on
                            targets less than 50 percent of the time we ask. TACAIR response to
                            road- watch team reports has, on average, run about 45 percent. If 10 to
                            20 percent of these failures can be ascribed to weather, this means that
                            35 to 45 percent of the time there were just no aircraft. Situation has
                            improved somewhat since reduction in air operations in North Vietnam
                            freed jets to conduct more strike sorties in Laos. I know that our
                            respective staffs could juggle the statistics endlessly, but my
                            conviction is that we are still not getting all we need on daily
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>3. Seventh AF has usually responded well to our crisis requirements, such
                            as present buildup at Site 36. However, we believe that many of these
                            last-ditch, crisis situations might have been averted if we had
                            sufficient strike resources on daily basis to hit enemy troops, staging
                            areas, and supply bases before our positions are placed in jeopardy.</p>
                        <pb n="726" xml:id="pg_726" facs="0758"/>
                        <p>4. To cover adequately existing targets and to respond quickly to new, we
                            estimate that in north Laos we require as daily minimum nine A–26 and
                            twenty-six A–1 sorties (with flare ship support). In south Laos we need
                            thirty A–1 sorties per day, four of which would be for infils/exfils,
                            the balance for tactical targets. (We boosted our earlier estimate of
                            requirements in south Laos based on developing tactical situation over
                            past six months, identified hard targets, and estimate of required daily
                            sortie rate.) Our minimum copter requirement is estimated to be 700
                            hours per month (200 hours in north Laos, 500 hours in south).</p>
                        <p>5. We believe that in addition to the tactical requirements above, we
                            will probably continue to need, from time to time, concentrated strike
                            efforts to meet fast-breaking tactical situations, such as occurred at
                            Phou Pha Thi (Site 85) and Site 36. We would expect, however, that fewer
                            such “surge” operations would be required if we receive our minimum
                            daily sortie requirements.</p>
                        <p>6. You already have general outline of our TACAIR needs but I wanted to
                            be sure that you knew more of the background of our requirements in
                            order to formulate “revalidation” recommendation requested by <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. Question of adequacy of US air support
                            looms large in future of our counter-insurgency operations in Laos.</p>

                        <p>The North Vietnamese have made substantial improvements to the wet-season
                            capacity of the road network in Laos used for truck transport <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0759"/>of supplies from North Vietnam
                            to South Vietnam in 1967–68. The estimated wet-season capacity for
                            continuous truck movement as far south as the A Shau Valley has been
                            increased from 50 to 100 short tons a day. An additional 50 tons of
                            capacity is available for movements along routes leading into Quang Tin
                            and Kontum Provinces.</p>
                        <p>The increased wet-season capacity of this road network, if fully used,
                            could sustain traffic volumes amounting to 85 percent of the daily
                            average—175 tons—moved during the 1967–68 dry season (September
                            1967–April 1968). The current requirement of Viet Cong and North
                            Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam for logistic support from the north
                            via Laos is only slightly more than 30 tons a day.</p>
                        <p>The improved capacity of the road network strengthens North Vietnam's
                            capability to provide sustained logistic support to Communist forces in
                            the South. It will also reduce the dependence of these troops on storage
                            areas and porterage for logistic resupply.</p>

                        <p>2. (S) The American Embassy, Vientiane, has stated continuing
                            requirements for tactical air support of Royal Laotian Government
                                (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) counterinsurgency operations
                            (references 1a and 1d) beyond that which <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> can provide with current and programmed forces
                            (references 1b and 1e).</p>
                        <p>3. (S) The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider effective <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> counterinsurgency operations to be
                            essential to the accomplishment of US objectives in Southeast Asia. They
                            are concerned about the threat posed by Pathet Lao/North Vietnamese Army
                            forces which, by the close of the 1968 dry season offensive, had taken
                            Nam Bac, Tha Thom, and Muong Phalane; threatened Saravane, Attopeu, and
                            Luang Prabang; and largely controlled Military Region III. The Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff share <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>'s view
                            that additional supporting tactical air would have a positive influence
                            on the actions of the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> Armed Forces
                            (reference 1c).</p>
                        <p>4. (TS) It is recognized that, if the bombing of North Vietnam is stopped
                            completely, additional forces may become available, in which case some
                            could be used to satisfy the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            requirement. In view of the current status of the Paris talks and the
                            situation is South Vietnam, it appears unlikely that the requirement for
                            bombing in North Vietnam will be reduced. On the other hand, there is a
                            distinct possibility that a resumption and expansion of the air and
                            naval campaigns in North Vietnam may be required.</p>
                        <p>5. (S) The US Air Force can provide the additional resources which <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> has stated will be needed to
                            meet American Embassy Vientiane requirements (references 1b and 1e),
                            within the time phasing indicated below, by:</p>
                        <p>a. Temporary addition of two A–1 squadrons to the force structure of the
                            US Air Force. First A–1 squadron (18 UE) by September 1968, increase to
                            25 UE by February 1969. Second A–1 squadron (18 UE) by November 1968,
                            increase to 25 UE by February 1969.</p>
                        <p>b. Increasing the UE of the 609th Air Commando Squadron from 12 to 16
                            A–26s.</p>
                        <p>c. Increasing the C–123 UE of the 606th Air Commando Squadron from 6 to
                            10.</p>
                        <p>d. Deleting all T–28s (12 UE) from the 606th Air Commando Squadron.</p>
                        <p>6. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) These forces would be deployed to
                            Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. Additional aircraft parking area and facilities
                            will be required at Nakhon Phanom for increased aircrew and support
                            personnel and support equipment. Construction costs utilizing troop
                            construction are estimated at $2.866 million. The present in-country
                            troop construction capability is insufficient to accomplish this
                            construction without deferring other work. Civilian contract
                            construction, if necessary, would approximately double the cost.</p>
                        <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0761"/>
                        <p>7. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) An increase of 914 military manpower
                            spaces in Thailand will be required. This manpower ceiling increase
                            takes into account the 139 military spaces which would be gained by
                            deleting T–28s from the 606th Air Commando Squadron. No other spaces are
                            available for tradeoff against this requirement.</p>
                        <p>8. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The support of these increased
                            forces at Nakhon Phanom and of expanded operations from Nakhon Phanom
                            will place an additional burden on the US Army logistical support system
                            in Thailand. Present support capabilities may be insufficient for the
                            support of both the increased forces at Nakhon Phanom and increased B–52
                            operations from U–Tapao (JCSM–333–68, dated 29 May 1968, subject: “B–52

                            date.</p>
                        <p>9. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider
                            that increased tactical air support should be provided to <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> counterinsurgency operations but not at
                            the expense of support to friendly forces in South Vietnam and other

                        <p>2. Both wars have assumed their customary rainy season pattern of
                            relative inactivity. <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> military

                            integration is similarly moving along. There may be an ambitious colonel
                            or two who is dissatisfied with the pace and manner of events, but the
                            power is not there. To improve the security of Vientiane some forty
                            arrests were rather arbitrarily made (with Souvanna's approval) and such
                            champions of fair play as Justice Minister Impheng have made a few
                            unpleasant noises about high-handed procedures. The military/security
                            situation is clearly manageable.</p>
                        <p>3. Politically, Souvanna remains as strong as ever. The main power
                            elements continue to regard him as the “only answer” to the current
                            situation. The Assembly, the Sannikones particularly, will have some fun
                            with Sisouk and the budget, but should not become recalcitrant to the
                            point of threatening the government.</p>
                        <p>4. You are well aware of the dimensions of the financial crisis. The
                            psychological spin-off effect of this crisis, however, has not been
                            adequately reported yet. The virtual disappearance of the gold market
                            has brutally laid bare to the Lao the true extent of their dependence
                            upon factors beyond their control.<note n="2" xml:id="d372fn2">A sharp

                                problems. Laos, one of two major gold importing nations in Southeast
                                Asia, was the source for much of the gold smuggled into South
                                Vietnam. The Tet Offensive disrupted smuggling routes during the
                                first half of 1968. In addition, the decision in March 1968 to
                                create a two-tiered world gold market and attending price
                                fluctuations in gold meant that gold imports to Laos dropped 50
                                percent in the first half of 1968 as compared to the same period in
                                1967. The drop caused a $1.8 million shortfall in Lao tax revenues.

                            upon us politically, militarily and economically, they have taken some
                            pride in the progress they were making in the economic area. To discover
                            that the stability of their currency resides in such unknowns as the
                            security of Saigon (for smuggling) and/or the world price of gold has
                            been shattering. It is noteworthy how frequently the word “fictif” has
                            crept into their vocabulary. They are beginning to wonder if indeed they
                            are a fictional people living in a mythical kingdom, an attitude similar
                            to a stage in adolescence sometimes known as “who am I?” A helpful and
                            related antidote to this depression has been their series of diatribes
                            against the North Vietnamese led and encouraged by King and Prime
                            Minister. Our little Lao friends seem to walk a little taller each day
                            as Lao Presse carries a new attack. For many, neutralism is not a manly
                            posture, and they seem to be working off some of their frustrations
                            through these verbal jousts, believing (correctly) that thereby they can
                            with pride, at least help, albeit not control, their cause in Paris.</p>

                            hawkish as ever. As to his domestic problems, I judge that he will
                            either genuinely manifest the psychological malaise or use it to seek a
                            political solution to his financial problems (increased US contribution

                            <hi rend="italic">I. Summary</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Rains have recently been falling steadily throughout Laos ending dry
                            season which saw enemy aggressively retake much of territory picked up
                            by <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> in past two years. This seems an
                            appropriate time for Country Team to assess results of enemy offensive
                            and make some tentative judgements on where we and they might go from
                            here.</p>
                        <p>2. Enemy has taken from <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> substantial
                            pieces of territory in north and northeast, considerably bruising
                            regular and irregular units in the process. Route of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> force at Nam Bac and capture of most
                            paramilitary bases north of <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> puts
                            enemy in much better position in these areas than one year ago. In
                            south, enemy territorial rains have been less extensive, however, in
                                <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> IV enemy has significantly
                            increased control over area around Saravane thereby improving his
                            capability to move through western fringe of Ho Chi Minh Trail
                            structure. In most areas of south Laos <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> units have been forced by enemy pressure to move into
                            defensive alignments around major population centers, leaving many
                            agricultural areas relatively unprotected. Enemy raids in these areas
                            have <pb n="732" xml:id="pg_732" facs="0764"/>seriously hampered <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> and other rural development
                            activities. Enemy maintains capability to attack simultaneously
                            Saravane, Lao Ngam and Attopeu.</p>
                        <p>3. At moment, enemy appears to possess sufficient strength to protect his
                            holdings and, if he wishes, pick up additional terrain in some areas.
                            However, enemy activity has diminished in past weeks as weather has
                            deteriorated, giving at least preliminary indication that enemy may
                            follow rainy season tactic of past years and concentrate on protecting
                            and consolidating his holdings while increasing harassment of
                            friendly-held areas through raids and ambushes. At this early juncture,
                            this can be only tentative appraisal and situation will require careful
                            observation during coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>4. In past years, <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> has used its
                            rainy-season logistical advantage (airlift) to take ground from enemy.
                            Thut rainy season, major offensive moves by <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> regular and irregular troops would not seem prudent
                            unless current conditions change markedly. Many <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> units are under-strength and, although most units are
                            adequately equipped and provisioned, morale is not good and unit
                            effectiveness in battle situations is uncertain at any given moment. At
                            present it would appear that <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> regular
                            and irregular troops should concentrate, in general, on holding line
                            against possible further enemy encroachment. More vulnerable enemy
                            salients might be hit under right conditions but major offensive action
                            would not appear feasible.</p>

                        <p>1. This memorandum is for your information and paragraph four suggests
                            that a meeting be held with the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>2. Attached is a memorandum of conversation with General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName>, new Commander of the 7th Air
                            Force, which took place on 10 July 1968. Also attached is a brief
                            summary table of our Laos air picture which I left with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">Attached, but not printed.</note> The briefing went
                            well, and I think we can count on General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> to be both helpful and cooperative within the
                            limits of his responsibility. This question of responsibility, however,
                            leads into General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName>'s most
                            telling point, i.e., the limits of his power to do anything substantive
                            for us without some definite alteration in policy directives.</p>
                        <p>3. Such an alteration is, in effect, what the Chief of Station and the
                            Ambassador have been after for some time. It has become apparent,
                            through voluminous correspondence on this subject and continual
                            foot-dragging of various command channels in the military establishment,
                            that further requests to meaningfully change the situation at the
                            tactical level will only meet with frustration and in the end be
                            fruitless.</p>
                        <p>4. To resolve this question, and I feel that it must be resolved if we
                            are to effectively support the Agency's effort in Laos, I recommend that
                            we proceed as planned with a meeting between the DCI or you and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Clifford</persName> or Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, and possibly the
                            Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, during which the
                            nature of the air support problem would be exposed along with the need
                            for a higher priority in support of irregular operations in Laos. If,
                            during these discussions, it can be resolved that a higher priority can
                            be given to provide at least a minimum of sustained support to our
                            operations in Laos, a special SIG meeting may not be necessary.<note n="3" xml:id="d374fn3">No record of these meetings has been

                        <p>Washington, July 11, 1968.</p>
                        <p>SUBJECT</p>
                        <p>Meeting with Lt. General George S. Brown </p>
                        <p>1. On 10 July 1968 CFE and ACFE/TBL met with General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName>, successor to General <persName corresp="#p_MGW1">Momyer</persName> as Commander of the 7th Air
                            Force. General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> will assume
                            his new duties in late July 1968, and our visit was to acquaint him with
                            problems which have arisen in connection with air support for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> did not recall
                            having been previously briefed in detail on the Station's paramilitary
                            operations in Laos, so the meeting began by CFE giving a general rundown
                            on the two wars being waged by <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            irregulars in North and South Laos. Apart from the overall picture, it
                            was specifically pointed out to General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> that effective and timely marrying of ground
                            irregular forces and tactical air support had the distinct advantage of
                            enabling the irregulars to inflict heavy damage on the enemy which he
                            could not do with his own portable firepower. With air artillery to
                            count on, the irregulars could take on more sizeable targets and have an
                            effect on enemy capabilities disproportionate to their relatively small
                            numbers.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s most pressing concern at this
                            time is that of being unable to obtain sustained commitments of air
                            support for these operations in Laos. Without such commitments, their
                            effectiveness is considerably reduced. We recognized the higher
                            priorities of the American effort in Vietnam and the difficulties in
                            diverting aircraft from these priorities to support the irregular war in
                            Laos. If, however, a minimum level of support could be provided on a
                            regular and continuing basis, it would make a significant difference in
                            an effort which is related to that in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>4. General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> commented that he
                            was sympathetic to our needs, was aware of our problem, and he realized
                            Ambassador Sullivan was already “laying in wait” for him regarding this
                            subject. He felt that there was no excuse for the Air Force not to meet
                            commitments that had been made, particularly in terms of operations
                            which had been predicated on commitment of just such air support. He
                            went on to add that he would do everything in his power to see that any
                            such commitments <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0767"/>which had been
                            made were met. He noted, however, that until the priorities were
                            changed, and he was instructed accordingly, support to the effort in
                            Laos would remain a low priority as it had been in the past, a fact
                            which he is powerless to change even as Commander of the 7th Air
                            Force.</p>
                        <p>5. General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> was shown a copy
                            of the <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> cable directing
                            additional helicopter support for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            operations as soon as helicopters could be positioned. He was also
                            advised that a recommendation by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                            had been moved forward which called for positioning additional aircraft
                            in the Theater to support a level of tactical air missions up to 65 per
                            day for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> replied that he had
                            serious doubts that, given budgetary and other prevailing
                            considerations, any additional aircraft would be allocated for our
                            purposes. If such aircraft were provided, however, he could readily
                            insure meeting air support requirements on a continuing basis for our
                            operations. He felt it would be unwise for us to get our hopes up on the
                            point of additional aircraft for tactical air support.</p>
                        <p>6. General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> was asked what he
                            thought could be done here in Washington to break this impasse. He
                            replied that a new decision allocating priorities would have to be made
                            which would elevate the priority of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            operations in Laos. While this might eventually require a decision at
                            the SIG level, a move which might have an initial effect would be for
                            the DCI to expose the problem to Secretary Nitze and the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. If agreement could be reached at this
                            level, a decision might be forthcoming which would provide for at least
                            a minimum dedication of sustained air support for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> operations in Laos.</p>
                        <p>7. Closing the meeting, General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> agreed to do everything possible to help our
                            efforts in Laos. He was encouraged to discuss these matters with the
                            Chief of Station who is looking forward to seeing him. General <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Brown</persName> emphasized once more, however,
                            that until directions came from Washington that the effort in Laos be
                            given a higher priority, the chances were slim for <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> getting more air support than that
                            being currently provided.</p>

                        <p>1. As preliminary step in my campaign to confront military leaders on
                            issue of corruption and general question of transferring greater share
                            of Lao fiscal and economic burden to shoulders Lao elite (reftel), I
                            hosted stag dinner last evening for <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>
                            military hierarchy.<note n="3" xml:id="d375fn3">A memorandum of
                                conversation of the dinner is in airgram A–315 from Vientiane, July
                                22. (Ibid., DEF 6 LAOS)</note> Occasion for this affair was visit to
                            Vientiane by my former military attache, Col. Bill Law, now retired. All
                            senior officers were present, except General Quan, who was in Bangkok,
                            and General Bounpone, who elected remain Savanna-khet and is sending me
                            letter explaining why he couldn't make it. Americans present were
                            service attaches, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> station chief,
                            political officers and requirements office (<gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss>) chief.</p>
                        <p>2. I spoke at some length and with rather brutal frankness about the
                            corruption I observed in this country and manner in which <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> protected and participated in it. I
                            stressed the point that, in any postwar situation, this fact was bound
                            to cause political resentment among population, who would therefore be
                            much more susceptible to Pathet Lao brandishment. Although I made no
                            threats and named no names, I cited specific cases of corruption which
                            were well known to and identifiable by all present at table.</p>
                        <p>3. Primary vocal reaction (probably pre-arranged) came from Generals
                            Oudone and Kouprasith. Both their presentations were highly defensive,
                            and Kouprasith's was quite emotional. Neither attempted to deny
                            prevalence of corruption nor FAR role therein, but only to explain its
                            origins and plead for comprehension.</p>
                        <p>4. I maintained firm position that I knew reasons for and origins of
                            problems, but that I was dissatisfied with failure to remedy it. I said
                            that King shared this view, had spoken to me at length on this subject,
                            and had urged me to help institute tighter controls. I said that, in
                            pursuit of this, my air attaché would be meeting with General Sourith
                            today to propose better method of controlling use of transport
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> My primary purpose in this session was
                            merely to expose depth and breadth of my concern and to worry these
                            officers a bit by <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0769"/>making it
                            clear that we were fully aware of activities afoot. My secondary purpose
                            was to give assurances to such honest Generals as Phasouk and Vang Pao
                            (both of whom were present and expressed great private satisfaction)
                            concerning U.S. official position on these matters, third purpose was to
                            let this meeting be ventilated among the colonels (by Col. Thongphanh
                            Knoksy who was also present) who let them know that they have our
                            support in effort to make <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> shape up
                            on these matters. It is, in one sense, unfortunate that Quan and
                            Bounpone were both absent since they (or their wives) are among primary
                            offenders. Quan had a legitimate excuse but Bounpone's absence may be a
                            little hard for him to explain. Both these gentlemen had received
                            private warning of my mood and may have made shrewd guess that absence
                            was the better part of valor.</p>

                        <p>8346. 1. Together with <gloss target="#t_AIRA1">AIRA</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Station Chief, I paid brief visit August 7 to General
                            Vang Pao in his mountain headquarters at Long Thien. Purpose of visit
                            was to award posthumous legion of merit to widow of Captain Moua Chong
                            who, as “tall man,” had acted as highly successful controller for USAF
                            strike activity until his death in 1966.</p>
                        <p>2. It was my first chance to see Vang Pao at his headquarters since my
                            return to Laos July 1, although I have seen him twice in the past few
                            weeks in Vientiane and Luang Prabang. (His visits to these cities and
                            his far easier relations with general staff represent considerable
                            improvement in Lao-Meo relations over past couple of years.)</p>
                        <p>3. I found Vang Pao energetic and active as usual, with great deal of his
                            time devoted to problems of resettled Meo who have become his charges.
                            He now has nearly 50,000 of them in the hills and valleys near his
                            headquarters. However, these cares do not deter him from military <pb n="738" xml:id="pg_738" facs="0770"/>plans on the frontiers of his
                            region, especially in Sam Neua and Xieng Khouang.</p>
                        <p>4. He regards Sam Neua as fairly well lost, and although he will continue
                            to mount operations there, these will be largely intelligence,
                            psychological, and harassing raids. He hopes to rebuild a few selected
                            areas of guerilla strength, but indicated no plans for major holding
                            operations in that northeasternmost province.</p>
                        <p>5. His attention, as usual, is concentrated primarily on Xieng Khouang
                            Province, and specifically on the Plaine des Jarres. He outlined plans
                            to re-establish positions and to mount campaigns which would effectively
                            encircle the plain. While he gave no time frame for these operations, he
                            is starting two or three of them in this rainy season.</p>
                        <p>6. In general, he feels the quality of North Vietnamese troops he is
                            facing has deteriorated. He assumes that many of the more experienced
                            have been sent to South Viet Nam and notes the presence of greater
                            number of ethnic minorities (especially Thai Dam) among his adversaries.
                            He feels these are liable to psychological persuasion and is
                            intensifying his efforts in this field.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Nature of U.S. De-Escalation</p>
                        <p>A. Complete cessation of bombing in NVN.</p>
                        <p>B. Cessation of air reconnaissance except for high level
                            reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Consequences of U.S. De-Escalation</p>
                        <p>A. Decreased area available for air interdiction of trail system and
                            other traffic into Laos, particularly if no-strike buffer zones are
                            established along the border (e.g., Mu Gia Pass).</p>
                        <p>B. Air interdiction in the trial area would become more costly since
                            there could be a greater concentration of enemy AA for the smaller area
                            to defend.</p>
                        <p>C. Greater conspicuousness of US bombing, particularly in north Laos (no
                            “cover” missions from Thailand to NVN), would prompt Soviets and others
                            to increase pressures on Souvanna to stop all US bombing in Laos.</p>
                        <p>D. Greater vulnerability of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces,
                            particularly in the north, because of the reduced effectiveness of US
                            bombing of NVN troop and supply centers near Lao border.</p>
                        <p>E. Anxiety in Thailand as well as Laos about US intentions.</p>
                        <p>F. Even less effective bombing in areas near the border if there is a
                            cessation of reconnaissance on traffic in North Viet-Nam headed for
                            Laos, particularly should there be no-reconnaissance buffer zones along
                            the border.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. If the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> maintains its present
                            policy toward Laos, each step in de-escalation in the Viet-Nam conflict
                            has a serious consequence for the <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0772"/>security of Laos and hence of Thailand. The general
                            Southeast Asian situation must therefore continue to be part of the
                            substance of negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>B. In the absence of any significant reciprocal de-escalation on the part
                            of North Viet-Nam, US air operations in Laos must be increased in order
                            to provide the same deterrent effect, against both <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> traffic for <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and communist forces operating against the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. The present level of US <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support
                            should be considered as essential for US minimum goals in Laos until
                            such time as the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> abandons its
                            present policy toward Laos. The possibility of increasing US <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> support should not be excluded if the
                                <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> should attempt to make
                            significant territorial gains in Laos to diminish the repercussions of
                            what it might consider a setback in South Viet-Nam. Similarly, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> assistance to the Lao guerrilla
                            operations must remain at least at the same level.</p>
                        <p>D. It may be necessary to modify the composition of the US air forces: to
                            include more propeller aircraft dedicated to operations in Laos, to
                            re-orient the direction of attack of the B–52's, to employ naval
                            aircraft in Laos to greater extent, and to make other adjustments of US
                            assets.</p>
                        <p>E. If we must institute no-bombing buffer zones on Lao territory close to
                            the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> border, there should be no
                            similar limitation on reconnaissance.</p>
                        <p>F. To provide partial cover for US air operations, there should be an
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss> air operations. To
                            this end, the capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_RLAF1">RLAF</gloss>
                            should continue to be improved (including improving the command
                            structure to attract and use effectively more combat pilots).</p>
                        <p>G. With decreased cover (i.e., fewer flights from Thailand to North
                            Viet-Nam) US non-admission (and Lao denials) of US bombing in Laos will
                            be increasingly ineffective. US and Lao public position, including
                            detailed press guidance, should be thoroughly worked out in advance.</p>
                        <p>H. There will be pressure to acknowledge US air operations officially—and
                            in effect to renounce the Geneva Agreements—in order to encourage our
                            allies and assure some elements of the American public that something is
                            being done against infiltration into <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. There should be contingency planning on how to resist
                            these pressures.</p>
                        <p>I. The <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> will not only be opposed to
                            official US admission of US bombings, but in recompense for the risk to
                            which Laos exposes itself by permitting US bombings in the trail area of
                            south Laos it will expect as a quid pro quo augmented US air support in
                            the defense of areas of importance to the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, particularly in north, northeast and central Laos.</p>
                        <p>J. Current ground operations in the trail area from South Viet-Nam
                            (Prairie Fire, Igloo White) should be continued within their present
                            scope and pattern, particularly to support tactical air operations.</p>
                        <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0773"/>
                        <p>K. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> roadwatch operations from the Lao
                            side should be continued at a level necessary to fulfill their
                            surveillance mission. Capability of <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>-directed guerrillas in south Laos should be increased for
                            greater protection of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> interests
                            there in the event of a <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> reaction in
                            south Laos and also for operations from the west against certain parts
                            of the infiltration routes.</p>
                        <p>L. Contingency plans for a standdown of US operations should be devised
                            for the eventuality that the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> may
                            wish to use the trail complex for unannounced exfiltration from South
                            Viet-Nam. These plans should include provisions for air reconnaissance
                            of the trail area.</p>
                        <p>M. We should inform the Lao and Thai governments of US intentions in
                            adopting de-escalation, but our counter-actions will in the long run be
                            the most effective reassurance.</p>
                        <p>N. To provide maximum justification for increased air operations (which
                            will be at best an open secret), there should be increased assist-ance
                            to the Lao government's program publicizing North Vietnamese aggression
                            in Laos, as an unacknowledged justification for US air actions. Other
                            Asian nations should be encouraged to be more outspoken in their
                            recognition (and hopefully condemnation) of <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> interference in Laos.</p>

                        <p>9296. Subj: Vang Pao visit. Ref: State 242995.<note n="2" xml:id="d379fn2">In telegram 242995 to Vientiane, September 23, the
                                Department welcomed the private visit of Vang Pao and planned to
                                coordinate with <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> his meetings with key officials.
                                The visit and awarding of decorations to the two most prominent
                                “thin” generals Vang Pao and Phasouk, according to the Department,
                                would not go unnoticed in Laos, especially among the “fat” generals.
                                The Department asked for an appraisal of the Vang Pao visit on Lao
                                politics. (Ibid.)</note> For Dep Asst Sec'y Godley.</p>
                        <p>1. I believe your plans for Vang Pao are excellent and am sure results of
                            this visit will be mutually beneficial as was case of Phasouk visit.</p>
                        <p>2. In general, these visits have considerable positive political after
                            effects which may be difficult to measure at any given moment but which
                            have a cumulative effect. This is true for “fat” as well as “thin”
                            generals.</p>
                        <pb n="742" xml:id="pg_742" facs="0774"/>
                        <p>3. For example, we think that Kouprasith's visit to the US in August 1966
                            was to some degree responsible for the “statesmanlike” image he has
                            assiduously projected in recent years replete with effusive
                            protestations of support for Souvanna. Appearances aside, however, there
                            is no doubt that Kouprasith is keeping his ambitions in check. We
                            believe, therefore, that his visit to the US served to reinforce this
                            mission's efforts to maintain political stability and strengthen
                            Souvanna's position, the bedrock of US policy in Laos.</p>
                        <p>4. To return to the “thins,” we have dramatic short-term results from
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName>'s visit: During
                            Souvanna's recently concluded meetings with the generals and colonels,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> reportedly played a
                            leading role in supporting Souvanna. He vigorously waded in on the
                            corruption issue in plenary sessions; also, <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> made it clear that he supported Souvanna
                            politically and in “brutally frank” terms warned his military colleagues
                            against any thoughts of overthrowing the civil authorities.</p>
                        <p>5. Van Pao supported <persName corresp="#p_PS1">Phasouk</persName> whose
                            outspoken position obviously reflected to a considerable degree the
                            influence of his recent experiences in Washington. A follow-up with Van
                            Pao at this time is eminently in our mutual interests.</p>

                        <p>The rainy season this summer in Laos brought no major or important
                            military changes. The lull in the fighting and the apparent reluctance
                            of the Communists to press their dry season advantage has given the
                            government side a much needed respite. But although the modest gains <pb n="743" xml:id="pg_743" facs="0775"/>made by government troops since
                            June have improved their tactical situation and their morale, the
                            Communists are in a stronger position in Laos than they have been at any
                            time since 1963.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. My discussions with Souvanna re bombing in Laos if and when we cease
                            bombing North Viet Nam have been categoric and specific. I believe
                            situation therefore is clear and that he has stipulated his willingness
                            to let us throw into Laos the entire weight of both tactical air and Arc
                            Light effort which would be available as result cessation of NVN
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>2. Such strikes would, of course, have to be conducted within rules of
                            engagement which currently apply in Laos. However, in area of maximum
                                US–<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> interest, along Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail, these rules provide all flexibility we need for maximum
                            effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>3. It should be understood, especially if cessation occurs in dry season
                            when enemy pressure is heaviest against <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> territory, that there may also need to be an increase
                            of U.S. air effort against regions and objectives (i.e. north Laos)
                            which are not of direct and immediate interest to <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss>. This means that, in order to
                            maintain full level of Souvanna's collaboration on this matter, U.S. may
                            have to divert some resources to strikes which are primarily of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, rather than US–<gloss target="#t_GVN1">GVN</gloss> interest. This would be small price to pay, and very
                            minimal proportion of total effort available. However, I think it
                            important to crank this element into our planning.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, having said all this, I think we should also realistically
                            assume that Souvanna's current staunch position will come under
                            considerable <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0776"/>strain when the
                            moment of truth arrives. We can expect the full force of the Hanoi
                            propaganda claque world-wide, to turn on Souvanna and the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> in effort to get bombing lifted in Laos
                            as well as NVN. We can expect Soviets to bring considerable squeeze to
                            bear upon him. On recent form, we should also probably expect de Gaulle
                            and <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant to have a go.</p>
                        <p>5. Whether Souvanna will falter under this sort of onslaught is hard to
                            say. The King, I feel, will stay steady and so will most of his
                            Ministers. However, if press attention becomes too acute, and especially
                            if U.S. “spokesmen” begin admitting what we are doing, he may find
                            reason to waffle on the grounds that our understandings with him re air
                            operations are based on assurances that U.S. will not undercut
                            “deniability” of U.S. air operations in Laos. Therefore, in contingency
                            we are discussing, tightest possible control of U.S. spokesmen will be
                            at a premium.</p>
                        <p>6. In summary, I would say our current arrangements are sound. How
                            watertight they will prove in the event is yet to be tested. I believe
                            the test will be conditioned by (a) the season of the year (Hanoi
                            military counter-pressures can be heaviest in dry season), (b) the
                            duration of that period when Laos alone is conspicuously being bombed
                            and no general cease-fire is achieved, and (c) the intensity of the
                            campaign mounted against Souvanna by Hanoi and its claque.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> is arguing that we should mount now
                            a broad and concerted program to bring about another meeting of the Laos
                            Conference of 1962 as part of any settlement of Vietnam.</p>
                        <p> Bill Bundy's initial reaction was to brush the whole thing aside as
                            “premature.” Unless there is some support for the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> initiative I suspect the whole thing

                        <p>The guts of the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> suggestion is that we

                            Asian countries for the re-affirmation of the Laos Accords of 1962, and
                            that we persuade Souvanna Phouma to get out in front on this effort. I

                        </p>
                        <p>1. During past two months, Lao political hopes, military expectations and
                            civic performance have slumped into a subtle depression. Although
                            Souvanna returned to Laos from his sojourn in France prepared to
                            reorganize the armed forces and confront corruption (Ref A) he has
                            achieved relatively little towards his objectives. The military leaders,
                            who usually regain considerable terrain in the rainy season, have had
                            some limited successes in military region two and in the area of Muong
                            Phalane. But, otherwise, in the Sedone valley, in Borikhane, and in
                            other potentially significant regions, progress has been nil. In
                            addressing the problem of revenues lost though the collapse of the gold
                            trade, the National <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0778"/>Assembly
                            has failed to levy new taxes or give support to government efforts to
                            improve on old ones.</p>
                        <p>2. Hence, as Laos faces the end of the rainy season and the onset of the
                            northeast monsoon, it does so in a rather damp and daunted mood. In this
                            mood, Lao leaders begin to look to the stars and other external
                            indicators (rather than to themselves) as a further and fatalistic
                            explanation for their problems.</p>
                        <p>3. In casting about this way, there are three matters which trouble them.
                            The first is the failure of the Paris talks between U.S. and North Viet
                            Nam to make progress towards a peaceful resolution of the war. They had
                            genuinely hoped that these talks would mean movement towards a
                            cease-fire before the onset of the next dry season. Now, in the absence
                            of progress, they face with some dread the idea of a repetition of last
                            year's heavy attacks which paralleled the Tet offensive in South Viet
                            Nam.</p>
                        <p>4. Secondly, the overtones from Czechoslovakia are disturbing, not just
                            because of sympathy for the Czechs, but rather because they signal a
                            setback in the process of U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            detente. To most thinking Lao, the foundation for some hope of
                            independence of their country rests on U.S.- Soviet agreement, as
                            exemplified by the Vienna meeting of 1961 and the Geneva Accords of
                            1962. If the bases of this agreement should crumble, they see Laos
                            falling once again into the crevasse.</p>
                        <p>5. Finally, there is the question of the U.S. elections. Once again, they
                            are nervous because they fear the prospect that the policy which began
                            with the <persName corresp="#p_KRF1">Kennedy</persName> administration
                            in 1961 may be reversed and that current Lao leadership may be put in
                            jeopardy. They see General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi</persName>
                            inching towards a return, moving from Songkla to Bangkok, with Thai
                            consent. They see the Pathet Lao talking about “bi-polarization” of
                            internal politics and suspect the old cleavage may be revived.</p>
                        <p>6. With all this gloomy accumulation, it is rather difficult to get the
                            Lao to think in dynamic, constructive terms. There is a very real
                            discouraging tendency towards a sauve qui peut policy among the
                            leadership. Thus, attacks on corruption are being deflected and evaded.
                            Those whose hands are deepest in the till, for example, have been
                            counter-attacking against Finance Minister Sisouk, insisting that he has
                            been raising revenue by “illegal” forfaitaire contracts. The generals
                            whom Souvanna has been trying to bring under control have been
                            developing counter-schemes which would give them dominance in an
                            expanded military control scheme.</p>
                        <p>7. This, of course, is not the first time Laos has been in this mood, but
                            it is perhaps one of the most pervasive and enduring depressions I have
                            observed without some immediately discernible micawber moonbeams to
                            enlighten the future. We will provide additional report of circumstances
                            and prospects in subsequent cables.</p>

                        <p>The attached <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report<note n="2" xml:id="d384fn2">For the summary portion, see <ref target="#d380">Document 380</ref>.</note> focuses on the military situation in
                            Laos since the onset of the current rainy season last June. It states
                            that during the last dry season, November 1967 to May 1968, Communist
                            forces were able to inflict the worst defeats upon the Royal Lao
                            Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) forces since 1962 and
                            to erase much of the latter's hard-earned gains of the past five years.
                            While some gains have been made by the government since June, the
                            Communists remain in a stronger position than they have ever been at any
                            time since 1963 and probably possess more than enough resources to drive
                            RLG troops to the Mekong, should they choose to do so. However, the
                            Communists do not appear willing to turn on the pressure at the risk of
                            inviting greater US participation and, in the near future at least, will
                            more likely take only those measures needed to protect current holdings
                            and to keep open the infiltration routes to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>This is a sound, though brief assessment of the current military
                            situation in Laos. While noting the limitations of Communist strategy in
                            Laos, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> has put the emphasis, and
                            perhaps rightfully so, on the significant gains scored by the enemy—a
                            development to some extent overshadowed by the more dramatic events in
                            South Vietnam since Tet. Much of the improved Communist posture has been
                            related directly to military requirements in northern Laos, but, as the
                                <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> report points out, the situation
                            has been gloomier for the government in southern Laos where perhaps the
                            main objective of enemy dry-season efforts was to protect and expand
                            Communist infiltration routes into South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>However, having stated this, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> could
                            have gone much further than it did to underscore the point. For example,
                            while acknowledging Communist road building activity in northern Laos,
                            the report fails to mention that a far greater effort was made in the
                            panhandle, resulting in the construction of five new cross-border routes
                            connecting the north-south trucklines in Laos with Communist base areas
                            in South Vietnam. The improvement in the Communist road system in the
                            Laos panhandle has undoubtedly facilitated the unprecedented level of
                            supplies moving toward South Vietnam during the greater part of 1968, as
                            shown in the <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0780"/>attached chart on
                            Communist truck sightings.<note n="3" xml:id="d384fn3">The attached
                                chart indicated that truck sightings in 1967–1968 followed this
                                progression: 992 in October 1967; 4,234 in November 1967; 6,024 in
                                December 1967; 6,734 in January 1968; 5,094 in February 1968; 5,933
                                in March 1968; 9,198 in April 1968; thereafter dropping almost
                                steadily to 962 in August 1968.</note> Without a logistical effort
                            of this magnitude, the Communists could have hardly undertaken the
                            accelerated military offensives launched this year in South Vietnam.</p>

                        <p>At a recent meeting between Mr. Katzenbach, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">W. Rostow</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HRM1">Helms</persName> and Mr. <persName>Bundy</persName> concern was
                            expressed over the possibility that, in order to create additional
                            pressures on the US and her allies, the North Vietnamese might utilize
                            forces recently withdrawn from South Vietnam and/or North Vietnamese
                            forces already in Laos to increase military pressure against <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military forces, and perhaps even to
                            attempt to overrun Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> has asked <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> to pull together the various concepts
                            and opinions within the Department of Defense regarding military actions
                            which the US Government could employ in response to North Vietnamese
                            actions in Laos. He would like to examine possible responses to three
                            alternative courses of action by the North Vietnamese:</p>
                        <p>1. That the forces withdrawn from South Vietnam will remain in Laos but
                            not engage in any overt action against the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces but will remain as threat to the security of
                            Laos and re-entry threat to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0781"/>
                        <p>2. That the North Vietnamese will provide enough additional support to
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces to create a threat of
                            overrunning Laos gradually measuring our responses as they go.</p>
                        <p>3. That the North Vietnamese will provide sufficient additional support
                            to the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces to support an attempt to
                            overrun Laos quickly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> would like an appraisal
                            of the military courses of action with which we might respond to these
                            three contingencies, including the effect our actions might have against
                            the capabilities and intentions of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/North Vietnamese forces, the time it would take to initiate
                            and bring to full force the various courses of action, the effect such
                            action would have on US deployments and capabilities elsewhere, and the
                            operational cost of conducting such actions. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> would like an examination of (1)
                            stepped-up air campaigns, and (2) the introduction of US ground forces
                            in conjunction with these air campaigns. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> also requests that you clearly identify
                            assumptions and soft spots in your analysis. In addition, if deemed
                            appropriate, you may wish to examine the ramifications of an invasion of
                            North Vietnam or other military actions you believe might cause the
                            North Vietnamese to desist from any attempt to overrun Laos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NPH1">Nitze</persName> would appreciate having
                            your general thoughts on this subject by October 30th. He recognizes
                            that this is insufficient time to develop fully the requirements, costs
                            or ramifications of various courses of action and that the initial
                            submission will not be complete.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary. We do not expect any major change in enemy intentions in Laos
                            during next twelve months.<note n="4" xml:id="d387fn4">As of October 21,
                                the White House received weekly Laos Situation Reports that reported
                                on the military situation and internal political/administrative
                                developments. The set can be found in the Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Country File, Laos, Vol. XVIII, Memos,
                                1/68–1/69.</note> In period of evolving détente involving withdrawal
                            of NVN troops from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> and continuing
                            discussions concerning a negotiated settlement to war in SE Asia, we
                            assume NVN would not wish increase level of belligerence in Laos to
                            point change nature of war here and invite reprisals in NVN. Enemy at
                            present probably has sufficient troops to implement whatever intentions
                            it may have and is in advanced positions at beginning dry season. For
                            next six months (dry season), we expect enemy to put pressure on Meos in
                                <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, and move against renewed
                            irregular activity in NW; enemy will maintain threat to Mekong Valley
                            and protect Ho Chi Minh Trail; country wide, enemy will probably seek
                            extend areas it controls for purposes propaganda and eventual political
                            bargaining. In following six months (wet season) we would expect enemy
                            to attempt hold as much territory as possible. NVN troops withdrawn from
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> would not be necessary for
                            implementing enemy intentions during next twelve months, but, of course,
                            could make enemy task easier.</p>
                        <p>2. Choices for US policy are limited. During next six months we must a)
                            reassure Lao of continuity of policy and support; b) assure ready and
                            continual availability of US strike aircraft in support of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces; and c) work with the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> to make enemy attempts at territorial
                            conquest as costly as possible, building on some positive developments.
                            For the next wet season (following six months) we must be prepared to
                            encourage and assist <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces to
                            recover as much territory as possible for political purposes.</p>
                        <p>3. Assumptions. “Release” of NVN assets from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> would be part of military détente package which would
                            include projected withdrawal of some NVN units from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> into Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0783"/>
                        <p>4. Part of this détente would be agreement or at least tacit
                            understanding that NVN units withdrawn would not stay in Laos, but would
                            eventually go home.</p>
                        <p>5. Since situations in Laos and Viet Nam inextricably intertwined under
                            direction of Hanoi, Hanoi in own interests would not agree to military
                            de-escalation in Viet Nam while at same time increasing posture of
                            belligerency in Laos to point of changing nature of war.</p>
                        <p>6. Within limits of 5. above, there is scope for considerable enemy
                            aggressive military action.</p>
                        <p>7. Although discussions may be underway concerning a negotiated
                            settlement of the war in SE Asia, firm decisions concerning a settlement
                            in Laos have not been made during the period under consideration.</p>
                        <p>8. Enemy intentions and capabilities. Key question, therefore, is one of
                            enemy intentions in Laos which to date has kept rein on enemy
                            capabilities. Tactical situation in Laos has not been determining in
                            most respects; even with great asset of complete air superiority, <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>
                            irregulars are not capable of stopping most determined enemy advances
                            during dry season (as most dramatically re-emphasized during last dry
                            season). A bigger or better <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and
                            irregular force can, of course, make such advances more costly to the
                            enemy and to this extent have an inhibiting effect in local situations.
                            The point, however, is that the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            armed forces do not, and cannot, protect Laos from a NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> military takeover should Hanoi make this
                            decision (the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> knows this).
                            Furthermore, this action probably could be carried out with the forces
                            the enemy presently has in Laos or with additional in-puts which are
                            available in NVN.</p>
                        <p>9. The military situation, therefore, would not be materially affected by
                            additional assets available to NVN through withdrawal of troops from
                                <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. Availability of additional NVN
                            troops probably would allow enemy more flexibility in spreading out and
                            physically occupying more terrain, however, which might be desirable for
                            political bargaining purposes.</p>
                        <p>10. Last dry season. To review briefly the status of the general military
                            situation in Laos (considerable details are contained in <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> reports which are readily available to the
                            Intelligence Community in Washington):</p>
                        <p>During the last dry season enemy forces estimated at 48,000 NVN and
                            51,000 <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> wiped out most territorial
                            gains made by the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> in previous two
                            years from north to south; enemy offensive destroyed effectiveness of
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> in north and “road” to Luang
                            Prabang wide open; in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, Site 36 alone
                            was only major base to survive onslaught; enemy within easy reach of
                            Mekong Valley urban centers in middle and central Laos; in south,
                            Attopeu and Saravane invested. At that time, enemy could have moved into
                            Mekong Valley with Meos providing only serious, rolonged <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0784"/>organized ground resistance country
                            wide, but they would have been most vulnerable to air attack. It should
                            be noted that for this campaign Hanoi augmented its forces in Laos by 19
                            battalions (7575 men) 7 battalions (2775 men) in north and 12 battalions
                            (4900 men) in south. We have no evidence NVN troops have been withdrawn
                            from Laos.</p>
                        <p>11. Objectives of dry season offensive varied according to area and
                            represented different mix of pol/mil factors. In addition to opportunity
                            destroy <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> reserves and eliminate
                            advance guerrilla base, victory at Nam Bac important for adverse
                            pol/psychological shock effect it had on <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>; other side of coin was significant boost it gave to
                            NLHS frayed prestige and fortunes in north.</p>
                        <p>12. In <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, NVN roll back of Meo's due
                            sensitivity of Hanoi for security its frontiers and concomitant concern
                            for loyalty its tribals as well as desire knock out installations at
                            Phou Pha Thi. Security of <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> also
                            enhanced, area important politically in Lao domestic scene.</p>
                        <p>13. In center, appears enemy motivated primarily by desire take territory
                            (such as Phalane) “illegally” held by <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> (a major theme to justify offensive throughout Laos)
                            and keep <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> nervous and
                            off-balance.</p>
                        <p>14. In south, similar elements involved, but overriding consideration was
                            protection of Ho Chi Minh Trail and pinning down <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces in static defensive positions. As Dept recalls,
                            we had good evidence enemy also intended seize and hold Saravane and
                            Attopeu, prior to failure offensive to achieve its major aim of general
                            uprising of urban population in key areas of <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. Enemy had at that time (and has now) military
                            capability to take these towns, as well as other major towns in Mekong
                            Valley. (If Tet offensive had succeeded, it possible enemy might have
                            thrown caution to winds and moved towards Mekong, counting on
                            disruptions in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> to inhibit our
                            response.)</p>
                        <p>15. Wet season. During the current wet season which is rapidly coming to
                            a close, the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> forces with few
                            exceptions have done little to regain territory lost to the enemy during
                            the last dry season and, hence, improve defensive posture for coming dry
                            season. (In fact, FAR hard pressed to maintain necessary security in
                            area still under <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> control as
                            evidenced by enemy forays against Rte 13.) With the exception of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> victory at Muong Phalane (which
                            included a healthy in-put of irregulars), and reoccupation some of the
                            area north of Paksane by <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> V, the only
                            real offensive action has been carried out by <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> irregulars. For example, in Sayaboury, irregulars are
                            engaged in a continuing operation, in coordination with the <gloss target="#t_RTA1">RTA</gloss>, against <gloss target="#t_CT1">CT</gloss> troops and infiltration routes supporting insurgency in
                            adjoining Thai Provinces. In the northwest, the irregulars are
                            aggressively carrying the war to the enemy in a series of small clashes.
                            In the <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, Vang Pao has reoccupied area
                            east of Routes 61/68 lost to enemy last dry season and is attacking
                            around Phou Pha Thi <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0785"/>and the SE
                            edge of the <gloss target="#t_PDJ1">PDJ</gloss> in an effort to
                            establish forward defensive positions against expected renewed enemy
                            pressure in the coming dry season. In the south, irregulars are active,
                            of course, along the length of the Ho Chi Minh Trail as well as Rte
                            110.</p>
                        <p>16. <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> inactivity is due to several
                            factors. First, the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> has still not
                            recovered after the clobbering of the dry season. It is still in process
                            of general (and apparently interminable) reorganization at the top,
                            still plagued by recruiting and training deficiencies. In this respect,
                            as of 30 Sept 68, <gloss target="#t_ARMA1">ARMA</gloss> estimates that
                            of 73 bns, only 23 can be considered “combat ready.” To some degree
                            related to the above, is a marked decrease in the “combative” spirit of
                                <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> commanders. For example, Phasouk
                            as usual is extremely cautious and has not undertaken his planned
                            campaign to recover the Sedone Valley; Bounpone and <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> III appear to be manufacturing excuses
                            not to do anything; Sayyavong, despite apparent good intentions, has
                            been ineffective in <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> I, possibly
                            because he must reply on Bounchanh who has his head stuck in the sand.
                            As a result, Luang Prabang is no better defended now than it was
                            immediately following the fall of Nam Bac. In <gloss target="#t_MR1">MR</gloss> V Kouprasth has mounted several sweep operations at our
                            insistence (primarily to protect road building projects) but the hard
                            core enemy areas remain intact.</p>
                        <p>17. Next six months. As we look toward coming dry season (November–May),
                            military situation on ground is as follows: The enemy with exception of
                                <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss> Laos is in generally same
                            positions as at end of last dry season. Enemy forces consist of 47,295
                            NVN troops, and 51,130 <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> troops. <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces consist of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>/FAN 63,000 and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> irregulars 40,000. As mentioned earlier, <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> is in bad shape, although enemy also in
                            pretty sorry condition, his capabilities are probably sufficient to
                            implement Hanoi's intentions in Laos.</p>
                        <p>18. We do not, of course, know what Hanoi's intentions are for coming dry
                            season. We assume, however, they will reflect to great degree situation
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. If this is in direction of
                            detente, we would not expect enemy to jump off from advanced positions
                            to move into Mekong Valley thereby clearly and overtly destroying Geneva
                            Accords, thus releasing US and others from present inhibitions in Laos
                            as well as inviting direct retaliatory action in NVN. Even if situation
                            is in direction intensification of hostilities, we doubt Hanoi would
                            take such risks for little apparent gain, since protection of
                            infiltration routes does not depend on physical possession of Mekong
                            Valley. Also, we assume <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would use
                            its influence with Hanoi to preclude such occurrence.</p>
                        <p>19. For coming dry season, therefore, we would expect enemy not to risk
                            overturning delicate balance in Laos by overly adventurous military
                            action, but to protect infiltration routes; also enemy will seek to keep
                            pressure on <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> by: a) maintaining
                            threat to Mekong Valley; b) moving against resurgent irregular activity
                            in NW; c) driving against Meo forward <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0786"/>outposts with eventual aim of taking Site 36 and
                            shutting Vang Pao up in Long Tieng; d) disrupting <gloss target="#t_USAID1">USAID</gloss> activities where possible. In sum,
                            enemy will attempt maximize its control over or presence in as much
                            territory as possible within limits dictated by prudence. NVN troops
                            withdrawn from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> could be useful in
                            this effort, although not essential.</p>
                        <p>20. Major domestic purpose of enemy maintaining territory won and
                            “nibbling” against area under <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            control is to strengthen bargaining position of NLHS in eventual
                            negotiations leading to reconstitution of provisional government of
                            National Union. In this respect, we note that both Pathet Lao and Radio
                            Hanoi claim “liberated zone” comprises one-half to two-thirds of Lao
                            territory and 50 percent of population which may be good indication of
                            initial NLHS bargaining positions in such negotiations.</p>
                        <p>21. Second six months. Although projection this far into the future is
                            difficult, we believe the enemy will attempt to hold as much territory
                            as possible during the next wet season for political purposes. Given the
                            logistical problems the weather imposes, the enemy would have stockpiled
                            supplies during the dry season and might consider augmenting his forces
                            to inhibit or defeat successful <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> wet
                            season offensives. Here again, NVN troops withdrawn from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> could be useful to some extent.</p>
                        <p>22. Conclusions. Under the circumstances, choices for US policy are
                            limited during the period under study. We must reassure Tha Lao of the
                            continuity of US policy and support.</p>
                        <p>23. We must assure that US strike aircraft are readily and continually
                            available in sufficient numbers to support <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces. This is particularly true in <gloss target="#t_NE1">NE</gloss>, which is not “sensitive” internationally
                            (like the Mekong Valley) but extremely important domestically and where
                            Vang Pao and the Meo will be very hard pressed. We will continue to prod
                            the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> into more effective action to
                            make the enemy's “nibbling” as costly as possible, thereby hoping to
                            preclude loss of additional fringe areas during the dry season, with
                            eventual aim of recovery of some areas if possible in next wet season.
                            In this respect, we hope to build on some encouraging signs of past few
                            months (increasing employment of <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> and
                            guerrillas in joint operations; establishment of air/ground op centers
                            country wide) which indicate possibility of more united and coordinated
                            efforts by <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces.</p>

                        <p>Dear Bill:</p>
                        <p>I have done some research on the problem presented in your letter<note n="2" xml:id="d388fn2">In an Official-Informal letter to
                                    <persName>Bundy</persName>, October 1, Sullivan reported that
                                shortly before the Republican Presidential convention, Souvanna told
                                Sullivan that if Nixon were elected Souvanna would resign. Sullivan
                                thought that Souvanna was only expressing his preference for
                                    <persName corresp="#p_HHH1">Humphrey</persName> whom he had
                                gotten to know well. On September 30 Souvanna asked how the election
                                was going and Sullivan suggested that Nixon could win. Souvanna
                                repeated in ringing tones his intention of resigning if Nixon won.
                                Sullivan asked <persName>Bundy</persName>'s advice on how to handle
                                what could become a serious problem. (Ibid.)</note> describing
                            several recent utterances by Souvanna concerning Mr. Nixon. I thought I
                            should get this reply back to you before November 5, so that you could
                            prepare the way in case this is how things turn out.</p>
                        <p>What I have done is to check Mr. Nixon's recent published utterances,
                            without finding anything conspicuously helpful. However, equally, his
                            statements in the last few years—and so far as I can tell during this
                            campaign—are wholly free of the past strictures against neutrals and
                            “neutralism” which in part account for Souvanna's attitude. In other
                            words, the written record gives no basis for positive reassurance, but
                            equally no basis for renewal of the fears that might have been held a
                            decade ago.</p>
                        <p>More to the point, I have talked to two senior people in the Nixon camp,
                            both of whom are intimately familiar with his views on the Laos
                            settlement of 1962 and on the existing dispensation in Laos, including
                            Souvanna personally. They assure me that, far from having the slightest
                            feeling against Souvanna or any trace of the old quarrels of the late
                            1950's, Mr. Nixon fully supports the 1962 settlement and Souvanna's
                            personal position, and—to the best of these gentlemen's knowledge—has
                            considerable personal admiration for all that Souvanna has accomplished
                            for his country in recent years.</p>
                        <p>You can draw on this in any way you see fit, including the use of my own
                            name as the quiet intermediary. I do really believe that the Prince has
                            no warrant for any concern that Mr. Nixon would change course at all
                            either on the fundamentals of the Viet-Nam war or on Laos both in itself
                            and its relationship to Viet-Nam. In short, whatever Mr. Nixon said in
                            the 1950's and whatever may have been his degree of association in the
                            period when we forced Souvanna out (and Phoumi in), he really has no <pb n="756" xml:id="pg_756" facs="0788"/>present feelings that would be
                            anything but cordial and approving toward Souvanna and the Laos of
                            today.</p>
                        <p>I am most grateful to you for writing me on this. Obviously, it is a
                            fairly sensitive kind of thing, but I do believe it is our duty as
                            servants of the US to correct misapprehensions of this sort where we can
                            honestly do so—as we can here. Naturally, a great many foreign visitors,
                            Ambassadors, and one or two special emissaries sent for this particular
                            inquiry, have been asking what Mr. Nixon's Asian policies would be. His
                            Foreign Affairs article of October, 1967, is an excellent answer in
                            almost all cases, but does not happen to touch on Laos. Everywhere else
                            in the area, people seem to be fairly sanguine about his succeeding,
                            including specifically Indonesians and even the Burmese Foreign
                            Minister. If it would help to relay that these “equally neutral”
                            gentlemen have come to feel that Mr. Nixon understands their postures,
                            you may include this in the conversation—which may be at whatever level
                            of solemnity or bibulousness you feel most effective.</p>
                        <p>New subject: I have just called Charles Lucet to convey to him, man to
                            man, your bright ideas about linking the LCU men to the recent Greek
                            festivities and/or what may or may not be coming events. He treated the
                            matter in his usual solemn fashion, but I think took the point and will
                            relay it in the right key. I said please to convey it as a Gallic
                            suggestion from Gallic imaginations, rather than the product of stodgy
                            American establishment minds. (I claimed credit for the idea myself, but
                            the historical record will be clear on the basis of this letter.)</p>
                        <p>I am neither downcast nor the reverse. Hold your hat. With warm
                            regards.</p>

                            YEAR</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusions</p>
                        <p>A. Over the past year the Communists have greatly strengthened their
                            combat forces in Laos. The combined Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>)/North Vietnamese Army (<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>) forces now number about 56,000 combat troops; they
                            could overwhelm the regular and guerrilla forces of the Royal Laotian
                            Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) in the coming dry
                            season. And we do not think that the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            could expand the size or capability of its forces sufficiently in 6 or
                            12 months from domestic sources alone to contain the Communists.</p>
                        <p>B. We do not believe that the Communists intend to conduct a major drive
                            to the Mekong, lest such a move provoke US entry into the Laotian
                            corridor and perhaps upset any negotiations underway on South Vietnam.
                            However, in the next few months, we expect the Communists to exert
                            further military pressure on government forces, especially on guerrilla
                            outposts, in order to strengthen their ultimate bargaining position.
                            They now demand that US bombing of Laos be halted as a prerequisite to
                            discussions of an internal settlement that must be based on “the
                            realities of the current situation.”</p>
                        <p>C. Even if <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> resources were released
                            from South Vietnam, we doubt that this would in itself alter Hanoi's
                            intentions in Laos, since the forces already there can launch an
                            offensive without further reinforcement. Though developments in Vietnam
                            could change Hanoi's calculations concerning Laos, in general we believe
                            that the Communists hope to achieve their objectives without running
                            great risks of military counteraction.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Discussion</p>
                        <p>1. Hanoi has ambitions to control all of Laos, but has been unwilling to
                            take actions there which would jeopardize higher priority goals in South
                            Vietnam. In particular, Hanoi has limited the scope of its military
                            actions in Laos, in part, at least, out of concern for provoking a
                            large-scale US ground action against the vital supply routes to South
                            Vietnam which run through Laotian territory.</p>

                        <p>2. Since the 1962 Geneva settlement, the war in Laos has been
                            characterized by Royal Lao Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) offensives during the rainy season (May to October)
                            when the mobility of Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>) and
                            North Vietnamese Army (<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>) forces is
                            restricted, and by Communist counteroffensives during the dry season
                            (November to April) to retake lost areas, often just in time to seize
                            the rice harvest. Thus an uneasy equilibrium has been established, with
                            military factors operating on the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            and political factors on the Communists to restrain actions that might
                            provoke a major reaction by the other side.</p>
                        <p>3. In the political field, both sides have continued to pay lip service
                            to the 1962 Geneva Accords, which neutralized Laos, and until recently
                            to the Zurich and Plaine des Jarres Agreements, which established a
                            tripartite government—rightists, neutralists, and the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>. This arrangement has persisted despite
                            the fact that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> vacated their
                            cabinet seats in April 1963. These are still kept open for them by
                            Souvanna, the neutralist Prime Minister. Until this July it seemed as
                            though the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> objective, despite their
                            denunciations of Souvanna, was the restoration of the tripartite
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">I. Recent Developments</p>
                        <p>4. Several recent events, however, suggest that the Communists are
                            developing a new position. For the first time, they have made a bombing
                            halt a specific prerequisite to discussions of an internal political
                            settlement. Moreover, while still reaffirming the 1962 international
                            agreements, they have demanded that the internal settlement must take
                            into account “the realities of the current situation.”</p>
                        <p>5. In private, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and Soviet spokesmen
                            have explained that such “realities” mean a recognition of <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> control over large areas of Laos (they
                            claim two-thirds of the territory and one-half the population). In
                            addition, they contend that the US and its “puppets” have destroyed the
                            tripartite structure, that Souvanna no longer represents a neutralist
                            faction, and that the present government is, in effect, illegal.
                            Apparently, the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> are laying the ground
                            work to claim a large role in a new government, and may demand that the
                            neutralists aligned with them in the so-called “National United Bloc”
                            occupy the positions now held by Souvanna's neutralist faction.</p>
                        <p>6. While thus signaling their intention to reorder the old tripartite
                            arrangement, the Communists have reaffirmed their regard for the
                            monarchy as a “permanent feature” of Lao national life. Indeed, the
                            whole point of the rather odd visit of the North Vietnamese Ambassador
                            in July after a four year absence seemed to be to make a dramatic
                            distinction between the King and the present Lao government, and this
                            line has been supported by the new Soviet Ambassador and the Neo Lao Hak
                            Xat (<gloss target="#t_NLHX1">NLHX</gloss>) spokesman in Vientiane. The
                            Communists have always paid deference to the King's position and may
                            hope that the King's desire to <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0791"/>preserve the kingdom and establish a united national community can be
                            played upon to their advantage.</p>
                        <p>7. The Communists are taking other steps to improve their political
                            position. During the past rainy season, they have made more of an effort
                            than ever before to consolidate control over their territory. After
                            unsuccessful attempts to terrorize mountain people who have been
                            assisting <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> guerrillas in the north,
                            the Communists are seeking to win them over by cajolery. This is
                            apparently part of a wider effort to improve their hold over the
                            mountainous and sparsely populated reaches of Phong Saly, Luang Prabang,
                            and Houa Phan (Sam Neua) Provinces, where they have been stepping up
                            their propaganda and political indoctrination programs. Newly
                            constructed roads give the Communists access to hitherto isolated areas.
                            In the south, <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> troops have been busy
                            trying to consolidate their hold over the rice-rich Sedone Valley, where
                            the government carried on a development program from 1965 until July
                            1967. There are recent reports that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> civil administration is being reinforced by Lao
                            political cadre who have just completed political training in North
                            Vietnam. One report indicates that in Savannakhet Province North
                            Vietnamese political cadre have been attached to the Communist
                            administration for the first time.</p>
                        <p>8. By the fall of 1967, the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> had made
                            considerable inroads on territory that the Communists held in 1962.<note n="2" xml:id="d389fn2">See centerspread maps. [Footnote in the
                                source text. The maps are not printed.]</note> The Communists
                            finally responded by turning an RLG offensive in the Nam Bac area into a
                            debacle for the government in mid-January 1968. During the remainder of
                            the dry season, the Communists administered a series of defeats to the
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> which added up to the worst
                            government setback since the precarious days of 1961 and 1962. The
                            psychological impact was considerable. There was a good deal of
                            apprehension in Vientiane that the Communists would break out from the
                            previous pattern of military action and push on to the Mekong.</p>
                        <p>9. But this did not happen, and perhaps the most notable feature of the
                            rainy season now drawing to a close was the lack of significant new
                            moves by either side. The Communists did not press their advantage, but
                            devoted themselves to a more intensive political consolidation of their
                            territory than heretofore. <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces,
                            who for their part, usually regain considerable terrain in the rainy
                            season, had only some limited success in the northeast and in the area
                            around Muong Phalane. <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> progress has
                            been nil in the Sedone Valley in the south, in Borikhane Province, and
                            in other potentially significant regions.</p>
                        <p>10. These developments in the military and political fields seem to form
                            part of a pattern related in large part to Communist strategy in South
                            Vietnam. In anticipating that 1968 would be a “decisive” phase in <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0792"/>Vietnam, Hanoi moved to
                            increase its logistic capabilities in Laos, strengthen its forces there,
                            recover lost ground, and set back and demoralize <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces. And in their recent statements they have set
                            the stage for demanding a new settlement on more favorable terms should
                            the situation in South Vietnam move into serious negotiations. In short,
                            the Communists have developed a stronger military position while at the
                            same time they are preparing, if the situation in Vietnam warrants, to
                            move into a more active political phase in Laos.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">II. Capabilities</p>
                        <p>11. Our estimate of current <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> strength in Laos is about 98,000
                            (51,000 <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and 47,000 <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>), compared to about 72,000 a year ago.
                            The most important increments have been in combat troops, where <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> strength has grown from 28,000 to 31,000
                            and <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> strength from 16,000 to 25,000.
                            To oppose these Communist forces the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            has a total of some 100,000 men. These include approximately 29,000
                            combat troops of the regular army (<gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>),
                            about 5,000 combat troops of the neutralist forces, and some 39,000
                            guerrillas, about 22,000<note n="3" xml:id="d389fn3">This figure is for

                        <p>12. <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> troops are probably about evenly matched in terms of
                            the general effectiveness of individual troops or battalions, and man
                            for man the Meo guerrillas are probably better fighters than either. The
                                <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> forces, however, are definitely
                            better than the <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss>, and the
                            psychological impact on the latter when attacked by the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> is often sufficient to precipitate
                            their defeat. This qualitative inferiority is somewhat compensated for,
                            however, by air support provided by Royal Lao Air Force T–28s, [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] and
                                <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> aircraft operating out of
                            Thailand. In good weather, the Lao fly about 100 tactical sorties per
                            week, the Thai pilots about 70, and the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> some 100–200. Such success as the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> has enjoyed since 1962 is due largely
                            to the combination of this air support with effective use of friendly
                            guerrilla forces.</p>
                        <p>13. For several years, Souvanna and other <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> leaders, including the military, have felt that if it
                            were not for the presence of <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> troops,
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces could probably quickly
                            dispose of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> threat. In our view,
                            this is probably too optimistic. Although in terms of present strengths
                            on both sides, Royal Lao combat forces would then outnumber those of the
                            Pathet Lao by more than two to one, we do not believe that this
                            numerical advantage would be decisive, in view of the many weaknesses
                            and divisions that will continue to limit <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> effectiveness whatever enemy it confronts. We do
                            believe that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> need a considerable
                            amount of <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>
                            <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0793"/>support to mount a major
                            attack, and that without it, the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            could almost certainly contain them. We also believe that in northern
                            Laos the Meo guerrillas could put considerable pressure on the PL. But
                                <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces could probably not reduce
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> forces and territory very
                            rapidly—if at all—without substantial outside logistical and air
                            support.</p>
                        <p>14. We continue to estimate, however—as we did in March 1968<note n="5" xml:id="d389fn5">See <gloss target="#t_SNIE1">SNIE</gloss> 58–68,

                            have the military capability to reduce the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> area of control to a few enclaves in fairly short
                            order. They could do so without diverting resources from South Vietnam

                            think that <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces could expand their
                            size or capability sufficiently in 6 or 12 months from domestic sources
                            alone to contain the Communists.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">III. Communist Intentions</p>
                        <p>15. There are several options open to the Communists over the next six
                            months or so. There are various indications of preparations to resume
                            military activity as the dry season commences, and it is possible that
                            the Communists have decided to exercise their military superiority and
                            quickly overun most of Laos. They might think this would be an effective
                            means of putting the US under new pressures to reach a general
                            settlement in Indochina. We believe this is unlikely. The Communists
                            would necessarily feel considerable uncertainty over US countermoves in
                            the Laotian corridor, especially at a time of changeover in American
                            administrations. And, as long as the outcome in Vietnam is in doubt and
                            under some sort of negotiation, we believe that Hanoi would not run
                            needless military risks in Laos before the chances of a new political
                            settlement there had been tested.</p>
                        <p>16. We do expect, however, that Communist forces will keep up substantial
                            military pressure on <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> forces in the
                            coming dry season. In the northeast, where General Vang Pao's Meo
                            guerrillas have long been a thorn in their side, particularly in Houa
                            Phan and Xieng Khouang Provinces, they will probably make a considerable
                            effort to reduce a number of guerrilla sites and consolidate their
                            claims. They will probably also try to clear the guerrilla outposts
                            along the border of northeastern Khammouane Province with North Vietnam,
                            as well as in the northwest Provinces of Houa Khong and Luang Prabang.
                            In the south, they will maintain the threat to the Mekong from Thakhek
                            to Champassak Province. They will attempt to disrupt US-sponsored aid
                            and development programs. And, of course, they will protect their vital
                            infiltration and supply routes to South Vietnam in the Laotian
                            corridor.</p>
                        <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0794"/>
                        <p>17. We anticipate more direct political pressures on Vientiane and the
                            King, which these military moves will serve to reinforce. At some point,
                            depending again on developments in South Vietnam, the Communists might
                            offer to open negotiations, providing the bombing in Laos ended. In any
                            case, Hanoi would believe its military pressures would improve the
                            chances for eventual negotiations on better terms.</p>
                        <p>18. Obviously, a major change in the situation in Vietnam could affect
                            Hanoi's calculations. But we do not believe that the release of <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> assets from South Vietnam would, in and
                            of itself, be a decisive factor in changing Hanoi's policy in Laos. In
                            the event of a Vietnam settlement favorable to them, the North
                            Vietnamese would anticipate that political pressures would cause Laos to
                            fall into their hands fairly soon. They would therefore see no need for
                            ambitious moves in Laos that might risk upsetting any agreements reached
                            on South Vietnam, particularly respecting US military withdrawals.
                            Should the settlement be unfavorable to the Communists, we believe that
                            military caution in Laos would appear even more desirable to them.</p>
                        <p>19. Eventually, if the Communists cannot achieve what they want in Laos
                            through a combination of pressures, they may resort to a vigorous
                            military campaign. But for now, they appear to be moving slowly,
                            calculating that the outcome in Vietnam will be such that a new
                            settlement in Laos can be reached which would provide them an improved
                            power position, from which they could ultimately take control.</p>

                        <p>1. Order of battle information on the Communist forces in Laos is derived
                            from a number of sources. The most important are informants contacted by
                            clandestine friendly guerrillas and by road-watch teams. Other useful
                            information is obtained from prisoners and ralliers, from civilian
                            refugees—particularly low-level administrative functionaries—and from
                            special sources. The estimates of enemy strength are best in those
                            provinces where friendly guerrillas and other assets are most active:
                            Houa Khong, Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Khammouane, Savannakhet,
                            Saravane, Attopeu, and Sedone. It is least reliable along most of the
                            South Vietnamese border, in northern Phong Saly, southern Sayaboury, and
                            northeast Houa Phan (Sam Neua) Provinces. In the other provinces, where
                            we rely largely on the Laotian Army reporting, the quality varies—it is
                            reasonably good for Vientiane and Borikhane, but poor for Champassak,
                            Sithandone, and Wapikhamthong. Estimating the <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0795"/>number of North Vietnamese Army (<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>) and Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>) troops is also complicated by the mixture of <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            personnel within many individual battalions.</p>
                        <p>2. On the whole, we think the estimates are reasonably accurate and
                            support our conclusion that Communist strength in Laos is greater than
                            at any time in the past. Strengths fluctuate somewhat between the dry
                            and rainy seasons, however, as the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>
                            tend to put combat troops in for the dry season campaign—particularly
                            elements of the 316th <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> Division—and
                            then withdraw them during the rainy season. <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> combat troops outnumber the PL troops in the southern
                            provinces of Saravane, Attopeu, and Sedone, where, as might be expected,
                            the defense of their supply and infiltration corridor to South Vietnam
                            is most critical. There are about an equal number of <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>
                            troops in Houa Phan (Sam Neua) Province. In the remaining provinces, the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> out-number the <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> substantially, and there are no known
                                <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> battalions at all in four
                            provinces: Sayaboury, Vientiane, Champassak, and Wapikhamthong. The
                            dissident neutralist troops are all in Xieng Khouang and Phong Saly
                            Provinces.</p>

                        <p>10050. 1. During series meetings last few days, which have included
                            discussions with <gloss target="#t_CSAF1">CSAF</gloss> General McConnell
                            and with representatives of 7/13AF, we have worked out arrangements for
                            applying additional <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> air power to
                            Laos under the rules of engagement imposed both by Washington and the

                                Clifford sent President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> a memorandum that showed in tabular form the
                                increasing number of attack sorties in Laos during the first 5 days
                                of November 1968 (from 181 to 405) and the average daily attack
                                sorties for 1967 and 1968 (November was prorated at the November 1–5
                                rate). (Johnson Library, National Security File, Country File,
                                Vietnam, 5 EE 92, Laos, 11/68–1/69)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. These arrangements will result in a significant increase in sortie
                            rate in the Barrel Roll area, from an earlier daily average of about 30
                            to a new level of about 100 strike sorties per day. Although there will
                            initially be some control problems because of necessity to phase A–1E
                            aircraft through minor structural modification, we believe this level
                            should be well established by time normal enemy dry-season offensive
                            begins in this area.</p>
                        <p>3. In the south, sorties have already risen from a level of about 100 per
                            day to 250 per day and should go higher when Commando Hunt and other
                            operations go into effect. Therefore, despite anticipated extra enemy
                            efforts to increase traffic on trail structure, movement should become
                            more difficult and expensive, especially if effort can be maintained
                            around the clock.</p>
                        <p>4. Although press is currently distracted by U.S. elections, events in
                            Paris, and non-events in Saigon, we expect them soon to zero in on this
                            increased activity. We note there have already been some informed leaks
                            about “tripling” the level of activity in Laos. We will continue to
                            decline to speculate on sortie rates for our “reconnaissance” operations
                            on grounds this is operational question.<note n="3" xml:id="d390fn3">In

                        <p>10177. 1. In our responses to requests for intelligence estimates and for
                            contributions to planning documents, we have consistently projected for
                            the foreseeable future a level of enemy military activity in Laos
                            roughly comparable to that which we have experienced in the past few
                            years. Since these projections have occasionally been questioned I
                            thought it might be useful to elaborate the rationale on which they are
                            based. Needless to say, if the rationale proves in error, the
                            projections lose their value. Hence, I feel it is important that
                            addressees should weigh these premises.</p>
                        <p>2. I start from the premise that the North Vietnamese have failed in
                            their objective to gain a military victory in the south by the massive
                            introduction of main force units. I assume that they recognize the fact
                            that the more they put in and the higher they raise the level of
                            conventional combat, the greater are their losses to superior American
                            firepower. They have therefore apparently decided to desist from further
                            “escalation” of conventional combat in the south and move back to a
                            clandestine guerrilla situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d391fn2">In telegram
                                42583 from Saigon, November 13, the Embassy in Vietnam stated that
                                although it agreed with much of Vientiane's analysis, it believed it
                                emphasized too strongly North Vietnamese willingness to persuade the
                                U.S. that it would be safe to withdraw its forces from South
                                Vietnam. The Embassy in Saigon suggested that North Vietnam was
                                prepared to persuade the United States that it could not win in
                                Vietnam by a continuing military effort. Saigon did not believe that
                                the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would revert to “clandestine
                                guerrilla activity.” (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Their purpose in doing this is to “de-Americanize” the war by
                            persuading U.S. authorities that it is feasible to withdraw U.S. forces
                            from the south. Since their basic objective is to get these forces
                            irrevocably out, they recognize that they must pay some price for this.
                            But they hope to keep that price low enough that it will not curtail
                            their ability to maintain an effective guerrilla presence in the south
                            which can eventually destroy the political and military fabric of a weak
                            southern regime.</p>
                        <p>4. Our purpose, on the other hand, must be to exact such a high price
                            from them, and at the same time repair the weaknesses of the southern
                            regime, that we leave a balance on the departure of our troops which is
                            firmly and irrevocably favorable to the south, and destined to defeat
                            northern ambitions in that republic.</p>
                        <pb n="767" xml:id="pg_767" facs="0799"/>
                        <p>5. Since their concentrated and overriding purpose is to get U.S. forces
                            out of the south, it follows that Hanoi must comport itself in such a
                            way as to convey to us a confidence that we can safely remove our forces
                            without scuttling our objectives. It would be counter-productive for
                            them to launch major conventional attacks while this negotiating process
                            is going on. Anything which convinces the U.S. that it must retain its
                            troops in South Viet Nam is a defeat for the north, since U.S. troops
                            are the immovable obstacle to their military success.</p>
                        <p>6. If this logic is true in South Viet Nam, it is equally applicable to
                            Laos. For the North Vietnamese to “de-escalate” conventional operations
                            in the south, but to step them up in Laos runs the risk of providing
                            Washington with confused signals which could only deter or delay any
                            moves to reduce U.S. troop presence in the South.</p>
                        <p>7. Therefore, we have risked the calculation in our projections that no
                            dramatic changes will ensue in North Vietnamese military operations in
                            Laos while the Paris talks remain active. Anti-aircraft density may well
                            be augmented to match our new levels of air activity. Psychological and
                            political activity may also expand. But if ground warfare steps up
                            dramatically over the normal dry season levels, then our premises and
                            projections will both prove wrong.</p>
                        <p>8. The fact that it is altogether possible we could be wrong seems, in my
                            judgment, to require some study in Washington and Paris.</p>
                        <p>9. I feel we ought to have some way of correlating negotiating attitudes
                            to the North Vietnamese with the pattern of their behavior in Laos. I
                            assume there is some such correlation with the pattern of their behavior
                            in South Viet Nam. I would commend to Washington and our Paris
                            negotiators that this contingency also be extended to cover the more
                            unpleasant possibilities in Laos.</p>

                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff were requested specifically to appraise the

                        <p>(1) That the forces withdrawn from South Vietnam will remain in Laos but

                            threat to the security of Laos and re-entry threat to South Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>(2) That the North Vietnamese will provide enough additional support to
                            PL forces to create a threat of overrunning Laos gradually measuring our
                            responses as they go.</p>
                        <p>(3) That the North Vietnamese will provide sufficient additional support
                            to the PL forces to support an attempt to overrun Laos quickly.</p>

                            it appropriate to identify and to appraise possible military actions
                            which the United States might take in response to North Vietnamese
                            actions in Laos. However, with respect to the specific questions posed,
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it important to recognize two
                            relevant points:</p>
                        <p>a. First, that the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>) Forces now in Laos have the capability
                            to overrun most of Laos quickly without reinforcement by North
                            Vietnamese Army (<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>) Forces withdrawn
                            from South Vietnam.</p>
                        <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0801"/>
                        <p>b. Second, that the fact that the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> Forces have not thus
                            far attempted to overrun Laos is the result of a policy decision and is
                            not due to insufficient means.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, they consider that the threat postulated in NVN course of
                            action 3 already exists. <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> overrun of Laos can occur without
                            withdrawal of enemy forces from South Vietnam and with no lessening of
                            pressure there. Accordingly, analysis of courses of action available
                            must be considered as a function not of additional <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> support provided to the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> and the resultant threat but of observed
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> actions.</p>
                        <p>Military actions which the United States could employ in response to NVN
                            course of action 1 (NVN Forces withdrawn from South Vietnam remain in
                            Laos but do not engage in any overt action against Royal Laotian
                            Government (<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>) Forces) are set forth
                            in Appendix A hereto.<note n="5" xml:id="d392fn5">Attached, but not
                                printed.</note> As long as <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> Forces do not attempt to overrun Laos,
                            US military actions in support of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>
                            Forces operating against the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> should continue essentially as at
                            present. This envisages close air support of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> Forces by US air elements consistent with the priority
                            of other requirements.</p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> take the actions implied in NVN course of action 2
                                (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> Forces commence overrunning Laos gradually, measuring
                            US responses as they go), the United States will be required to
                            reevaluate its position and its entire strategy in Southeast Asia. Such
                            action on the part of NVN would indicate that its participation in the
                            Paris talks is fraudulent and that NVN expansionist policies have
                            changed only with respect to direction. If the United States decides to
                            meet this new communist challenge, the most important initial actions
                            should necessarily take place in diplomatic channels, through which the
                            United States could inform Hanoi that continued NVN aggression would
                            result in intensified military action against NVN. It would not be
                            militarily sound to commit US ground forces in Laos unless the decision
                            were also made to destroy the capability or the will of NVN to persist
                            in its aggression. Accordingly, military actions on the order of those
                            presented in Appendix B5 hereto would be required if the United States
                            should elect to defend Laos and defeat NVN. If, on the other hand, the
                            United States were unwilling to assume a national commitment to defend
                            Laos and defeat NVN, US military actions in Laos in response to NVN
                            course of action 2 should be limited to increased air interdiction of
                            base areas and lines of communications in Laos and close air support for
                            defending <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> units.</p>
                        <p>If the actions implied in NVN course of action 3 occurred (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>
                            attempt to overrun Laos quickly), the situation would differ from that
                            envisaged for NVN course of action 2, principally with respect to the
                            time available for decision making, diplomatic exchange, and military
                                <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0802"/>response. Military actions
                            which might be considered in this situation are those in Appendix B not
                            preempted by enemy initiatives. If the North Vietnamese attempt to
                            overrun Laos quickly, it is unlikely that even greatly increased US air
                            support of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> Forces could prevent it.
                            Further, it would not be possible to introduce US/allied ground elements
                            into Laos in such force as to prevent <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> Forces from
                            overrunning the country, with the possible exception of forces
                            sufficient to defend bridgeheads across the Mekong River to cover
                            Vientiane and some other key population centers. Subsequently, to
                            recover Laos from the communists would require a major campaign against
                            their forces in Laos, a campaign which would be costly and uncertain of
                            success unless accompanied by the defeat of NVN. If such direct action
                            is not taken, the United States must be prepared to accept communist
                            control of Laos and the resultant substantially increased threat to
                            Thailand and the remainder of Southeast Asia.</p>
                        <p>Even if a national decision to defend Laos and defeat NVN were made, the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that unilateral US military action in
                            Laos probably would not be effective in the achievement of US objectives
                            in Southeast Asia. Unless the free nations of the area perceive the
                            threat and respond with the full commitment of their resources, the
                            basis for effective US intervention is missing. Accordingly, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff attach the greatest importance to multilateral action in
                            the common defense and to the fullest appreciation of all diplomatic
                            measures before a resort to military alternatives, even those undertaken
                            on a multilateral basis.</p>
                        <p>We agree with the Joint Chiefs of Staff that we should make every effort
                            to secure diplomatic support for the integrity of Laos and should
                            attempt to obtain multilateral support for any actions we might take.
                            For this purpose, in addition to such diplomatic initiatives previously
                            suggested by <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss>, two actions with
                            regard to the <gloss target="#t_RTG1">RTG</gloss> might be considered:
                            (1) we could furnish the <gloss target="#t_RTAF1">RTAF</gloss> with as
                            much training as it can usefully absorb to take over a part of
                            air-support actions in Laos, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] on the same basis as the US now
                            operates; and (2) we could furnish the Thai armed forces with increased
                            amounts of equipment when it becomes excess to our needs in South
                            Vietnam to serve in part as a deterrent against <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> actions against the Mekong Valley towns.<note n="6" xml:id="d392fn6">At this point there was a marginal note in an
                                unknown hand: “Lao are as reluctant for a Thai embrace as the North
                                Vietnamese for a Chinese.”</note> Both actions would serve the
                            additional purpose of helping to dispose the Thai favorably to grant the
                            US access to Thai facilities should this be desired in a post-Vietnam
                            context.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the applicability of the military
                            actions outlined in the Appendices hereto can only be determined in <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0803"/>the light of all the
                            circumstances obtaining at the time of the decision. Nevertheless, it is
                            their intention to continue their appraisal of these contingencies.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the foregoing assessment by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            offers a sound basis for further consideration of this problem. Dick
                            Steadman's office will continue to be the focal point for <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> participation in the further
                            development of a report for the White House. Appropriate <gloss target="#t_OSD1">OSD</gloss> and Joint Staff members are available

                        <p>There is attached the Country Team Assessment of U.S. policy for Laos in
                            which I concur. The Summary of this Assessment is as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Summary</p>
                        <p>Both wars in Laos (in the North/Northeast and in the Panhandle/Ho Chi
                            Minh Trail area) have maintained their see-saw character during the past
                            nine months. Political restraints operating on both of the contest-ants
                            and their supporters make improbable the achievement of a decisive
                            military victory by either side. The Lao political scene during this
                            period has been relatively stable with nearly all of the major civilian
                            and <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0804"/>military power centers
                            supporting Souvanna Phouma, who continued to enjoy US/<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> support as well. The enemy has
                            signalled that it has been preparing for political competition should
                            the talks at Paris lead to an end to military hostilities in Laos.</p>
                        <p>The wars constituted a substantial drain on the small Lao economy, both
                            financially and from the standpoint of manpower. Some progress toward
                            self-sufficiency was made, however, and the production of rice and
                            lumber increased in the secure area. The U.S. continued to bear most of
                            the economic burden of keeping Laos solvent, assisted mainly by Japan,
                            France, Great Britain and Australia.</p>
                        <p>The outlook for Laos during the next twelve months is directly related to
                            progress or lack thereof at the Paris peace talks. Lack of progress
                            would probably not have significant effect upon the conduct and result
                            of the wars in Laos. The economy would progress only in the secure areas
                            and the economic burden for Laos' friends would be about the same. The
                            political situation would show signs of strain, however, as the Lao will
                            to continue the war began to erode and the effectiveness of Souvanna's
                            neutralist policies called into question. To achieve its goal in Laos (a
                            viable, neutral, independent buffer state whose existence will reduce
                            the risk of direct confrontation between North Vietnam and/or China on
                            the one hand, and Thailand on the other, thereby diminishing the
                            possibility of further U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia) the
                            U.S. would need to reassure the Lao of the firmness of our policy and of
                            our resolve to see them through. The U.S. would also continue its
                            efforts to persuade other nations, particularly in Asia, to share the
                            burden even more.</p>
                        <p>If the Paris peace talks were to achieve a cease-fire in South Vietnam
                            but not in Laos during the next twelve months, we would not expect the
                            basic character of the wars in Laos to change, despite the consequent
                            increased availability of NVN troops for duty in Laos. This judgment
                            derives from the assumption that the existing political considerations
                            which deter the NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> from moving
                            dramatically to the Mekong, despite their probable, current capability
                            to do so, would continue to operate in the new situation. This
                            assumption would be reinforced if Hanoi, which has shown that it can be
                            sensitive to world opinion, decided that agreeing to a cease-fire in
                            Vietnam while at the same time stepping up military activities in Laos
                            would be an unacceptably inconsistent public posture.</p>
                        <p>Although the economic situation in Laos would not be significantly
                            affected by a cease-fire in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, the
                            political pulse here would certainly quicken. The prospect of possibly
                            imminent peace would goad the friendly Lao into a semblance of unity as
                            they prepared to compete politically with the Pathet Lao. Significant
                            Lao political elements (primarily rightists and military), however,
                            would probably seek solutions that did not involve integration of the
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> into the government. Various
                            ethnic <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0805"/>tribal groups would seek
                            to assure that their interests were considered in any future
                            arrangements. Every nation with an interest in Laos would reassess its
                            policies. The NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> for their part would
                            take steps to refurbish their political position. They would propose
                            political formulas for settlement which would, if accepted, considerably
                            enhance their political power and prestige. Cessation of U.S. bombing in
                            Laos would be one of their main goals and they could probably focus
                            sufficient public attention on this issue to force the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> to ask for cessation in return for a
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> promise to enter into “serious”
                            negotiations. In all, it would be an active, delicate and trying
                            political period, which would demand of the U.S. the utmost in
                            flexibility, resourcefulness, skill and energy. We would very likely
                            continue to support Souvanna Phouma as holding out the best hope for the
                            various Lao factions. We would take all steps necessary to ensure that
                            the agreement bringing peace to Laos was based upon the Geneva Accords
                            of 1962.</p>
                        <p>If the Paris peace talks were to end hostilities in both Vietnam and Laos
                            during the next twelve months, pressures would be strong to scale down
                            the opposing military forces. The Lao military would insist upon
                            retaining at least sufficient force, including its guerrilla capability,
                            to overcome decisively any Lao-based unrest. The most important
                            international political problem would be that of ensuring that all NVN
                            elements departed Laos and that means were devised to prevent any
                            significant re-infiltration. Internally, the warring factions would
                            agree upon a formula for settlement which would be fragile at best and
                            might in fact result in only the appearance of a settlement. There would
                            be a period of very difficult adjustment to the new circumstances. Lao
                            economic prospects would brighten as the reduced cost of the Armed
                            Forces, the release of manpower and increased production of foreign
                            exchange earners and of import substitutes (lumber, rice, tin, etc.)
                            augured for eventual basic self-sufficiency. Great flexibility and
                            caution would be required of the United States during this period. We
                            would have to eliminate activities that could be reasonably interpreted
                            as violating Lao neutrality and yet retain sufficient presence to be
                            able to assist Laos in the ways the agreement will require. The prospect
                            of a “permanent” peace in Laos should not, however, lull our sensitivity
                            to the enemy's ultimate aim of taking over Laos and we should be
                            prepared to reverse rapidly the reduction of <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> Armed Forces as well as of our own presence in Laos
                            should the enemy reveal his disregard for the agreement. The retention
                            of some bases in Thailand would be required for this purpose.</p>

                        <p>1. During our meeting on 18 November, you requested a report on the
                            status of our interdiction program in Laos.</p>
                        <p>2. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) During the summer interdiction
                            campaign in North Vietnam a strategy of impeding logistic flow by heavy
                            saturation of selected <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> choke points
                            was initiated. The terrain in the southern panhandle of NVN was
                            particularly suitable to such a strategy as all logistics destined for
                            Laos and <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> had to be channeled through
                            approximately six key points.</p>
                        <p>3. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) This same strategy is desirable but
                            not as easily adaptable to the geography of Laos. There are few roads
                            from NVN through Laos that can be entirely closed by aerial bombardment,
                            due to more readily available by-passes and alternative routings.
                            Consequently, in order to realize an effective degree of interdiction,
                            it is necessary to commit a large number of attack and Arc Light
                            aircraft against the entire <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss> network.
                            These strike forces (approximately 12,000 sorties per month) will
                            operate in a closely integrated air campaign, the concept of which was
                            forwarded to you on 16 October as “The Northeast Monsoon Plan.” This
                            plan was initiated on 15 November 1968.</p>
                        <p>4. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) The Northeast Monsoon Plan
                            prescribes a concentrated, intensified air campaign designed to bring
                            maximum pressure against the enemy <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>
                            in Laos. The essence of this plan is a quantitative increase in sorties
                            and qualitative improvements through further improvements in responsive
                            command and control systems, strategic placement and coordinated
                            monitoring of seismic and acoustic sensors (Igloo White), use of
                            improved air munitions, and integration of other reconnaissance and
                            intelligence resources. The requirement for improved air interdiction
                            munitions in support of the campaign was submitted by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, approved by the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff and forwarded to you by JCSM–668–68, dated 7 November
                                1968.<note n="2" xml:id="d394fn2">Not printed. (Ibid.)</note> A
                            significant increase in sorties began on 1 November (Enclosure);<note n="3" xml:id="d394fn3">According to the first enclosure, “Sortie

                                but not printed, there were 5,119 sorties in October 1968 and a
                                projected 12,000 in November 1968.</note> however, the qualitative
                            improvement <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0807"/>in munitions and
                            sensors will be a gradual process as improved items complete development
                            and test and reach production.</p>
                        <p>5. (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>) Since the Northeast Monsoon Plan was
                            not activated until 15 November 1968 it is too early to obtain a useful
                            evaluation. The limited statistics in the Enclosure reflect the period
                            1–17 November 1968.<note n="4" xml:id="d394fn4">The second enclosure,
                                attached but not printed, listed the types of targets destroyed or
                                damaged during November 1–17.</note> This was a shakedown phase of
                            the campaign and the results during this period cannot be considered
                            criteria of effectiveness or potential. It should also be noted that the
                            interdiction campaign is designed to destroy point and perishable area
                            targets such as bridges, fords, truck parks, POL, and supply dumps as
                            well as vulnerable road segments and trucks.</p>

                        <p>10490. 1. Prime Minister Souvanna yesterday asked me to have our aircraft
                            take special precautions to avoid inadvertent attacks against Chinese
                            road building crews in northern Laos. He said that there is just enough
                            substance to “agreement” which ChiComs made with General <persName corresp="#p_PN1">Phoumi Nosavan</persName> in 1962 to give them
                            legitimate pretext for doing this work as “aid” to Laos.</p>
                        <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0808"/>
                        <p>2. In general, his attitude is to “avoid poking the animals” while
                            waiting to see exactly what the Chinese intentions are. He is most
                            mindful of constant Peking reference to its 700 million citizens who
                            will avenge “wrongs” done to them.</p>
                        <p>3. On other hand, Souvanna would like regular photography run of this
                            area, in order to watch Chinese activity. He is especially interested in
                            observing whether Chinese attempt to go beyond Muong Sai or Nam Tha in
                            their construction work.</p>
                        <p>4. He speculates that Chinese may have been moved to pick up Houmi's road
                            building invitation by concern that North Vietnamese construction of
                            Route 19 westward from Dien Bien Phu was intended to bring area along
                            Chinese border under direct control of Hanoi. Heretofore, North
                            Vietnamese have had to supply their forces in Nam Tha area from
                                China.<note n="2" xml:id="d395fn2">On December 2 the Central
                                Intelligence Agency issued an Intelligence Information Cable
                                commenting on the motives behind Chinese road construction in
                                northern Laos. It reported that in early October 1968 a military
                                force of 3,000 armed Chinese began construction of a major new road
                                from the Sino-Lao border to a point connecting with a roadbed
                                leading to the Mekong River 30 kilometers from Thailand. The <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> suggested that this might indicate
                                Chinese sponsorship of the Thai subversive movement as well as
                                control of Pathet Lao elements closest to China's border.

                                not printed.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. United States: Since 1962, the United States has consistently
                            supported the aims of the Geneva Agreements of 1962 to perpetuate Laos
                            as a neutral national political entity serving as a buffer between
                            Communist and non-Communist Asia.</p>
                        <p>B. Hanoi: There are two views of NVN objectives with respect to Laos: (1)
                            that Hanoi desires to control all of Laos; (2) that Hanoi's interests in
                            Laos are limited to its value in seeking to control South Vietnam. The
                            evidence seems to support the second view.</p>
                        <p>C. China: The present Chinese leadership probably regards NVN as a
                            transmittal belt for wars of national liberation in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>. Peking will probably press Hanoi to
                            move vigorously in Laos so as to facilitate Communist control of the
                            country and broaden support for insurgent efforts in Thailand.</p>
                        <p>D. <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>: The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> apparently continues to regard the Geneva Accords of
                            1962 as offering the best means of attaining its purposes, and has
                            consistently reaffirmed its support for the Accords. The neutralist
                            solution gives the Soviet Union considerable flexibility and interposes
                            a barrier to Chinese expansion in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>The future of Laos in the post-war period will, to a large extent, depend
                            on the type of settlement achieved in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>; the most favorable terms for the US would be inclusion
                            of provisions for a return to the Geneva Accords of 1962.</p>
                        <p>However, the future of Laos will be determined more by what NVN
                            intentions are for Laos than by any particular kind of settlement in

                        <p>A. US: The initial negotiating position of the US should consistently and
                            publicly tie our goals of NVN withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> to our goal of <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0810"/>NVN withdrawal from Laos and should link the withdrawal of US forces

                            the Geneva Accords of 1962, we probably cannot expect more than a
                            maintenance of the present division in Laos and a scale down or
                            cessation of hostilities. This can be sustained only if we are
                            successful in deterring North Vietnam by inducing Asian and other states
                            to maintain intense and prolonged diplomatic pressure against further
                            NVN expansion. The threat of US or Thai military actions can, to some
                            extent, also deter further NVN expansion. A scale down or a cessation of
                            hostilities must be part of this course, both because the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> cannot sustain its present level of
                            hostilities indefinitely and because it would be extremely difficult for
                            the US to provide necessary tactical air support after fighting in
                            Vietnam was stopped.</p>
                        <p>B. NVN: It appears likely that Hanoi will keep its military activity in
                            Laos in low key during the Paris negotiations and confine its activity
                            to controlling such Laotian territory as is necessary to conduct
                            military operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>If Hanoi continues to confine its objectives to control of such Laotian
                            territory as is necessary to support operations in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, the level of US/<gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> military activity in Laos should not
                            increase. If, during the course of negotiations, Hanoi attempts to
                            extend its domination over Laos, a selective increase in US military
                            actions might be required although we could not prevent Hanoi from
                            capturing most of Laos.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">V. Post Settlement Laos (Tab E)</p>
                        <p>A. Hanoi's Objective: At a minimum, the <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> will wish to consolidate its control over the area it
                            now holds in Laos, and solidify the trappings of an “independent” Pathet
                            Lao. Maintenance of NVN/<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> control of
                            northern Laos and areas contiguous to NVN will remain more important to
                            Hanoi than the maintenance within Laos of a large military force. Having
                            waited out US withdrawal, Hanoi could be expected to use its ample
                            resources to assist the Pathet Lao to press for full control of
                            Laos.</p>
                        <p>B. Soviet Objective: The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> probably
                            sees support for a coalition government as the best way to both restrain
                            expanding Chinese influence and to avoid a larger conflict, possibly
                            involving themselves. There is some likelihood, however, that the
                            Soviets would mainly follow Hanoi's lead, accepting the risks.</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Chinese Objective:</hi> The Chinese probably fear
                            that a Laos buffer zone might turn into a semi-permanent block to the
                            extension of Chinese <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0811"/>influence.
                            Accordingly, Peking can be expected to urge Hanoi to take over all of
                            Laos rapidly, using whatever military forces are required.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">The Lao Government:</hi> The <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss>, as in the past, will remain almost totally dependent
                            on outside support from its friends and restraint on the part of its
                            enemies. There is good reason to hope that with adequate outside
                            economic and military assistance, the <gloss target="#t_RLG1">RLG</gloss> can be sustained as the recognized authority in areas
                            under its present control.</p>
                        <p>E. US Objectives: US objectives in Laos could be achieved through a
                            reaffirmation of the Geneva Accords. If we are not to create serious
                            misgivings in Thailand, however, it may be necessary to underscore with
                            our actions and military posture outside of Laos' borders our
                            determination to see that a neutral Laos is preserved in fact as well as
                            in name.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">VI. Recommendations</p>
                        <p>1. At Paris, continue to link <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss>
                            withdrawal from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> withdrawal from Laos. At the
                            appropriate point, state that US withdrawals from <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> will be contingent upon <gloss target="#t_DRV1">DRV</gloss> compliance with the 1962 Accords.</p>
                        <p>2. With Souvanna, urge him to take the lead in both highlighting the Laos
                            problem and possibly in calling for a reconvening of the 1962 Geneva
                            conferees. At some point, we may wish to separate the Laos and Vietnam
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. With the Thais, continue to reassure them of our interest and
                            commitment to their country's independence. Discuss with them organizing
                            greater Asian support for Laotian neutrality.</p>
                        <p>4. With the Soviets, begin a dialogue to remind them of our
                            responsibilities in Laos and to suggest the consequences of an attempt
                            by Hanoi to take over Laos before or after a settlement in South
                            Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>5. With interested Asian Nations, try to focus their attention on Laos
                            (where they may be more sympathetic to us than on Vietnam), and try to
                            get them to organize an “Asian solution” to the Laos problem.</p>
                        <p>6. With respect to military actions during negotiations, continue
                            military operations at their present level but be prepared to intensify
                            air and ground operations, accompanied by increased Thai activities in
                            Laos, if Hanoi attempts to extend its domination.</p>

                                below.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Reftel proposes enlargement of Prairie Fire operating zone at Mu Gia
                            and Ban Karai passes. It has been examined here in considerable detail
                            and with some anguish. It causes problems of a significant nature which
                            have their roots in the very complex arrangements we have worked out for
                            Prairie Fire over the years.</p>
                        <p>2. Fundamental to these arrangements has been the necessity to coordinate
                            Prairie Fire operations on one side of the line and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> guerrilla operations on the other. This
                            coordination is important not only to avoid inadvertent fire fights
                            between these different units operating independently, but also because
                            the roles and missions of these units are basically different.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> units have two distinct roles
                            and never mix the two. They are either passive intelligence teams which
                            deliberately avoid contact with the enemy or else they are special
                            guerrilla teams which carry out pre-planned raids and ambushes. It is
                            our experience that these two types of operation can not be carried on
                            in the same zone. The guerrilla actions always produce a reaction which
                            would have the effect of sweeping intelligence teams out of their
                            operating zone. Hence, we pick the areas for intelligence operations
                            away from the areas where guerrillas operate.</p>
                        <p>4. Prairie Fire teams, on the other hand, combine both passive
                            intelligence and active military operations. Even when the primary
                            mission of the team is described as intelligence, we note that the
                            mission usually involves at least one fire fight. Therefore, we consider
                            them, on balance, to be essentially guerrilla rather than intelligence
                            units.</p>
                        <p>5. As you may be aware, there is currently a special U.S. Intelligence
                            Board action (involving <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>-State-Defense-<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> reps
                            in Washington) which is assigning intelligence priorities in the Lao
                            Panhandle. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Vientiane is under
                            activities to measure North Vietnamese movements in critical areas.
                            These involve certain points inside North Viet Nam and other points in
                            Laos near the Mu Gia and Ban Karai passes.</p>
                        <p>6. Despite much juggling of operating zones to accommodate commando hunt
                            bombing objectives, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> has just
                            completed a realignment <pb n="781" xml:id="pg_781" facs="0813"/>of its
                            intelligence teams in these critical areas to meet the Washington
                            objectives. These teams operate in those same areas in which Prairie
                            Fire has expressed an interest. For the reasons outlined above, it is
                            not possible to mix Prairie Fire operations into this terrain.</p>
                        <p>7. On the other hand, at Washington request, <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> Vientiane has also established intelligence teams
                            inside the Prairie Fire zone at the point where Route 1036 enters Laos.
                            This is a precaution against the possibility that the North Vietnamese
                            may decide to shift their pattern of truck traffic in order to take
                            maximum advantage of shelter in North Viet Nam rather than exposing it
                            to attack in Laos in the northern stretches of the Ho Chi Minh
                            Trail.</p>
                        <p>8. This move into Prairie Fire territory has been coordinated with <gloss target="#t_MACSOG1">MACSOG</gloss>, and causes little problem
                            because Prairie Fire has not operated in this area for some time. If
                            Prairie Fire currently has spare assets because it has terminated strata
                            and other operations in North Viet Nam, this general area, which has
                            been dormant for some time, would seem a logical place for them to be
                            put to work. Although we would have to clear the matter with Washington,
                            we would nevertheless be willing to entertain a request that the
                            coverage of this particular territory be turned back as a Prairie Fire,
                            rather than a <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss>, responsibility.</p>

                            area on a case by case basis. Ref B strongly recommended that authority
                            be obtained to employ <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss> assets without
                            restriction in the proposed areas around the Mu Gia and Ban Karai
                            passes.</p>
                        <p>2. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName>'s
                            objections as expressed in Refs D and F and our comments follow:</p>
                        <p>A. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stated that
                            operations conducted in the positive control area (<gloss target="#t_PCA1">PCA</gloss>) will have to be limited and, therefore
                            have optimal estimated effective returns for the risk involved.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stated he had
                            pulled <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> assets out of these areas to
                            permit greater latitude of air operations and did not intend to reverse
                            this procedure for Prairie Fire. Comment: Prairie Fire operations in
                            these areas will comply with <gloss target="#t_PCA1">PCA</gloss> rules.
                            Prairie Fire insertions and air operations in proposed areas can be
                            coordinated as they are now in the present <gloss target="#t_PFAO1">PFAO</gloss>. The interdiction effort we are making in Laos should
                            be the maximum we can devise and target selection is an absolutely vital
                            part of this program. The value of Prairie Fire teams is that they
                            afford a real time target acquisition, reporting and exploitation
                            capability which <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> teams do not
                            possess. The U.S. led Prairie Fire teams can move quickly to and from
                            areas, direct air strikes on targets on opportunity through secure voice
                            communications (<gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss>-77 and KY–38),
                            perform ground operations against selected targets, emplace mines and
                            sensors, conduct wiretap operations, seize and evacuate prisoners, and
                            report critical intelligence information. Another major advantage is
                            that both ground and air operations will be controlled by a single
                            headquarters. What is required immediately is U.S. led personnel on the
                            ground that can search beneath the jungle canopy, uncover truck parking
                            areas, locate portering points, identify road by-passes, pinpoint troop
                            concentrations and report these findings directly to the <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> in an understandable language using
                            familiar terminologies. This is the kind of ground-to-air communication
                            and coordination that is urgently required and essential to effective
                            interdiction operations.</p>
                        <p>B. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> expressed a
                            concern for the political sensitivity of additional U.S. personnel in
                            Laos, stating that this could result in jeopardizing our present
                            operational understandings if an unauthorized ground operation were
                            exposed. Comment: The proposed <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss> areas
                            are under <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> rather than <gloss target="#t_FAR1">FAR</gloss> control. The <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> has consistently denied its <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0815"/>use of Laos and it is highly unlikely that <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss> operations would be surfaced by the
                                <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>C. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SWH1">Sullivan</persName> stated that
                            he does not mix <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> road watch teams
                            (which conduct passive intelligence) and special guerrilla teams (which
                            carry out pre-planned raids and ambushes). Guerrilla actions cause the
                            enemy to react and sweep the intelligence teams from their zones. He
                            indicated that <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss> teams, while having an
                            intelligence mission, are primarily guerrilla and should not operate in
                            the same areas as <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> road watch teams.
                            Comment: Concur that <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> teams should not operate in the same
                            area. In view of the benefits to be gained by Prairie Fire operations, I
                            support Abe in strongest terms, the objective must be to gather the best
                            possible targeting information. The threat to his command requires it.
                            This is substantiated by the fact that the Lao Panhandle enemy logistics
                            activity since 1 Nov 68 has reflected a significant increase in
                            intensity. It is estimated that enemy vehicle movements southbound in
                            the Lao Panhandle have moved 300 short tons per day. The Arc Light and
                            TAC air efforts alone have not been able to stop this traffic. A maximum
                            effort is called for, of which the <gloss target="#t_PFAO1">PFAO</gloss>
                            expansion is an integral part.</p>
                        <p>3. An additional factor bearing on this request is the significant
                            increase in <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_VC1">VC</gloss> air defense activity in Laos. The annual dry-season
                            increase in NVN anti-aircraft capabilities in the Lao Panhandle is far
                            greater than that of the past years. This trend is expected to continue,
                            especially along primary supply routes. Communist air defenses in Laos
                            still rely for the most part on the 37mm AA gun but a considerable
                            increase in smaller-caliber automatic weapons and larger-caliber guns
                            has been noted. The longer we delay full exploitation of our
                            air-to-ground capability, including <gloss target="#t_PF1">PF</gloss>
                            initiated strikes, the more difficult it will become to penetrate these
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>4. Additional detailed supporting rationale is contained in Ref G.</p>
                        <p>5. Recommend that authority be obtained as expeditiously as possible, to
                            permit expansion of the <gloss target="#t_PFAO1">PFAO</gloss> as

                            materiel to <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>—can be accomplished in
                            several ways, e.g., truck kills, creating choke points. A major facet of
                            current operations, Commando Hunt (accounting for over 30% of the above
                            Air Force attack sorties), has as its objective impedance of flow into
                            and through the system, rather than killing trucks. The 7AF preliminary
                            estimate is that November operations impeded up to 75% of the logistics
                            throughput to <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>. A major contributor
                            to this effectiveness was the closure for a large portion of the month
                            of the two major choke points of Ban La Boy (south of Ban Karai Pass)
                            and Ban Pha Nop (south of Mu Gia Pass). Even if 7AF figures are off by
                            100%, they estimate there would still have been insufficient throughput
                            to enable major stockpiling in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. There may be fewer trucks operating in Laos this year than last.
                            Sightings have remained relatively constant, whereas both <gloss target="#t_FAC1">FAC</gloss> and reconnaissance sorties each have
                            increased about 50% (from a combined total of 1905 to 2812). Thus, there
                            probably has been more double-counting of trucks this year. 7AF
                            believes, because of their estimate on reduced throughput, that truck
                            sightings this year largely are limited to trucks shuttling within Laos.
                            Any reduction in truck operations could have several possible
                            explanations. It may be, as 7AF believes (and our intelligence tends to
                            confirm) that the choke points have effectively reduced the inflow of
                            trucks. Another possibility is that the NVN by choice are using Laos
                            less. With their newly achieved immunity, it seems logical they would
                            want to reduce their vulnerability by employing NVN routes to just north
                            of the <gloss target="#t_DMZ1">DMZ</gloss>, then end-running or crossing
                            it. There is at present, however, no road network to support such an
                            endeavor by them of any magnitude; nor does our intelligence indicate
                            any such effort at this time.</p>
                        <p>4. A very large percent of our recorded truck sightings and kills (almost
                            90%) in Laos accrue at night. Operations during the day concentrate on
                            lucrative truck parks that Task Force Alpha sensors uncover during the
                            night. The results of this effort are hard to assess in specific truck
                            kills because of limited <gloss target="#t_BDA1">BDA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>My own conclusions after reviewing the data are twofold. First, it is too
                            early after the bombing halt to make firm judgments about the nature,
                            extent and effectiveness of our interdiction operations in the new
                            environment. Looking solely at truck kills, we did not do so well. On
                            the other hand, if the 7AF estimate on the reduction in throughput is
                            borne out, our air operations should be judged successful. It will take
                            a little longer for us to sort these things out and adjust to the new
                            situation. It may develop that the NVN demeanor and reduced activity
                            will show we have too much air power in Laos to employ it effectively.
                            Alternatively, NVN activity may require all the air power we have, if
                            not in Laos, in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">
                                <pb n="786" xml:id="pg_786" facs="0818"/>SVN</gloss> along the
                            infiltration routes or, though we hope it proves unnecessary, in renewed
                            operations in the north.</p>
                        <p>My second point relates to the point in my note of last Friday about
                            prejudging the nature of the war during 1969.<note n="5" xml:id="d399fn5">Not further identified.</note> I recognize and
                            fully support the goal of holding the <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            70 budget to the lowest possible figure. Since, however, any planned
                            phasedown of operations in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> included
                            in the President's budget almost certainly will become public knowledge
                            once it reaches Congress, I believe we should carefully weigh the impact
                            of such revelations on the negotiations in Paris, on our <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> allies, and on the course of operations
                            in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss> itself.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I cannot resist pointing out that no more than four months ago,
                            an <gloss target="#t_SA1">SA</gloss> paper in their monthly <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss> Analysis Report announced that truck
                            kills were not a good measure of effectiveness, because what counts is
                            whether enough materiel gets through, and besides there is an almost
                            infinite truck reservoir in China and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (as there is). How quickly views change!</p>
                        <p>We will continue to look into this matter and keep you informed of any
                            significant developments that would provide a more firm basis for making
                            any force structure decisions.</p>

                            of 30 Oct 68—Contingency Planning for Enemy Actions in Laos (<gloss target="#t_S1">S</gloss>).<note n="2" xml:id="d400fn2">See <ref target="#d392fn4">footnote 4, Document 392</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The renewed enemy offensive at Ban Tha Teng increases [our] concern
                            over North Vietnamese Communist designs. The enemy's new aggressiveness
                            there further emphasizes that Laos represents two geographic <pb n="787" xml:id="pg_787" facs="0819"/>fingers, one reaching south to Cambodia
                            flanking northern South Vietnam; the other pressing against northern
                            Thailand.</p>
                        <p>2. The attacks at Tha Teng and the reported build-up against Attopeu and
                            Saravane could presage a dramatic change of Communist policy; all three
                            areas are west of the “de facto Geneva line” of the 1962 agreements.
                            These latest maneuvers could lead to the acquisition of new territory in
                            Laos, threatening Vientiane's existing control in the southern
                            panhandle. Additionally, the Bolovens Plateau is the key terrain for all
                            U.S. operations plans in the panhandle. It is equally as important to
                            the Communists.</p>
                        <p>3. Thus far, the main strategic value of Laos has been as a corridor
                            area. Communist forces are now increasingly active in areas which are of
                            relatively minor import to the <gloss target="#t_LOC1">LOC</gloss>/logistics system serving South Vietnam. In the event of
                            reduced <gloss target="#t_NVA1">NVA</gloss> participation in <gloss target="#t_SVN2">SVN</gloss>, Hanoi could be expected to turn its
                            attention westward.</p>
                        <p>4. The following are likely enemy objectives:</p>
                        <p>A. Seizure of the Bolovens Plateau.</p>
                        <p>B. Coercion of the Royal Lao Government into abandoning Saravane and
                            Attopeu.</p>
                        <p>C. Expansion of operations in order to convince the United States that
                            continued presence in Southeast Asia is futile.</p>
                        <p>D. Enhancement of Communist efforts against a primary free world
                            stronghold in <gloss target="#t_SEA1">SEA</gloss>—Thailand.</p>
                        <p>5. Current enemy actions in Laos could foretell an initial attempt toward
                            achievement of all of the foregoing objectives. As the enemy's
                            intentions become more clear, it may well be that, as pointed out in Ref
                            A, a complete reevaluation of U.S. position and strategy in Southeast
                            Asia will be required. Hopefully, such a reevaluation would result in a
                            favorable decision to implement the military actions outlined in Ref
                            A.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Useful additional point for you to make in Prairie Fire meeting
                            concerns marginality of effect which could be expected from <gloss target="#t_MACV1">MACV</gloss> proposals. As we read current record
                            of truck kills and interdiction effort on Ho Chi Minh Trail, air strikes
                            are destroying approximately fifteen per cent of throughput. Even
                            wildest Air Force claims do not exceed twenty per cent.</p>
                        <p>2. By inserting Prairie Fire teams under the trees in the two passes, it
                            might be possible to raise the level of destruction a few percentage
                            points, say to eighteen or nineteen per cent. Question has to be whether
                            these few percentage points are worth the certain entrapments of teams,
                            losses of lives and heavy propaganda risks.</p>
                        <p>3. Finally, it should be understood that neither of these areas can be
                            serviced from current launch bases. Mu Gia will require a base in
                            Thailand (probably <gloss target="#t_NKP1">NKP</gloss>) and Ban Karai a
                            forward site on the Bolovens Plateau. This makes this marginal effort a
                            major peninsular move.</p>
