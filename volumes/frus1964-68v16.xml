                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The series
                    documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of policies
                    and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were first promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. These regulations, with
                    minor modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>A new statutory charter for the preparation of the series was established by
                    Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991. Section
                    198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV to the Department of State's Basic
                    Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be a thorough, accurate,
                    and reliable record of major United States foreign policy decisions and
                    significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the series should
                    include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of major
                    foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg:
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded. The editor is convinced that this volume, which
                    was compiled in 1992–1993, meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly
                    standards of selection and editing.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Structure and Scope of the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>This volume is part of a subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in the
                    foreign policy of the 5 years (1964–1968) of the administration of <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B. Johnson</persName>. The subseries presents in 34
                    volumes a documentary record of major foreign policy decisions and actions of
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s administration. This
                    volume documents U.S. policy toward Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Principles of Document Selection for the Foreign
                    Relations Series</p>
                <p>In preparing each volume of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    the editors are guided by some general principles for the selection of
                    documents. Each editor, in consultation with the General Editor and other senior
                    editors, determines the particular issues and topics to be documented either in
                    detail, in brief, or in summary.</p>
                <p>The following general selection criteria are used in preparing volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. Individual compiler-editors
                    vary these criteria in accordance with the particular issues and the available
                    documentation. The editors also apply these selection criteria in accordance
                    with their own interpretation of the generally accepted standards of
                    scholarship. In selecting documentation for publication, the editors gave
                    priority to unpublished classified records, rather than previously published
                    records (which are accounted for in appropriate bibliographical notes).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Selection Criteria (in general order of priority):</hi></p>
                <p>1. Major foreign affairs commitments made on behalf of the United States to other
                    governments, including those that define or identify the principal foreign
                    affairs interests of the United States;</p>
                <p>2. Major foreign affairs issues, commitments, negotiations, and activities,
                    whether or not major decisions were made, and including dissenting or
                    alternative opinions to the process ultimately adopted;</p>
                <p>3. The decisions, discussions, actions, and considerations of the President, as
                    the official constitutionally responsible for the direction of foreign
                    policy;</p>
                <p>4. The discussions and actions of the National Security Council, the Cabinet, and
                    special Presidential policy groups, including the policy options brought before
                    these bodies or their individual members;</p>
                <p>5. The policy options adopted by or considered by the Secretary of State and the
                    most important actions taken to implement Presidential decisions or
                    policies;</p>
                <p>6. Diplomatic negotiations and conferences, official correspondence, and other
                    exchanges between U.S. representatives and those of other governments that
                    demonstrate the main lines of policy implementation on major issues;</p>
                <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0005"/>
                <p>7. Important elements of information that attended Presidential decisions and
                    policy recommendations of the Secretary of State;</p>
                <p>8. Major foreign affairs decisions, negotiations, and commitments undertaken on
                    behalf of the United States by government officials and representatives in other
                    agencies in the foreign affairs community or other branches of government made
                    without the involvement (or even knowledge) of the White House or the Department
                    of State;</p>
                <p>9. The main policy lines of intelligence activities if they constituted major
                    aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward a nation or region or if they provided key
                    information in the formulation of major U.S. policies, including relevant
                    National Intelligence Estimates and Special National Intelligence Estimates as
                    may be declassified;</p>
                <p>10. The role of the Congress in the preparation and execution of particular
                    foreign policies or foreign affairs actions;</p>
                <p>11. Economic aspects of foreign policy;</p>
                <p>12. The main policy lines of U.S. military and economic assistance as well as
                    other types of assistance;</p>
                <p>13. The political-military recommendations, decisions, and activities of the
                    military establishment and major regional military commands as they bear upon
                    the formulation or execution of major U.S. foreign policies;</p>
                <p>14. Diplomatic appointments that reflect major policies or affect policy
                    changes.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Sources for the Foreign Relations Series</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute requires that the published record in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation on major U.S. foreign policy decisions and
                    significant U.S. diplomatic activity. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the U.S. Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State Historian by providing full and complete access to records pertinent to
                    foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Many of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration. The declassification review and opening for public
                    review of all Department of State records no later than 30 years after the
                    events is mandated by the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute. The Department of State and
                    other record sources used in the volume are described in detail in the section
                    on Sources below.</p>

                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Focus of Research and Principles of Selection for Foreign
                    Relations, 1964–1968, Volume XVI</p>
                <p>The editor of the volume sought to present documentation illuminating
                    responsibility for major foreign policy decisions in the U.S. Government, with
                    emphasis on the President and his advisers. The documents include memoranda and
                    records of discussions that set forth policy issues and options and show
                    decisions or actions taken. The emphasis is on the development of U.S. policy
                    and on major aspects and repercussions of its execution rather than on the
                    details of policy execution.</p>
                <p>
                    <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon Johnson</persName>'s personal involvement in
                    the making of foreign policy decisions relating to Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey
                    was intermittent and tended to focus on Cyprus during the 1964 and 1967 crises
                    on the island republic. The editor sought to document his role as far as
                    possible. Although the foreign policy record of the <persName>Johnson</persName>
                    administration is voluminous, many internal discussions between
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> and his advisers apparently were not recorded.
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s involvement as well
                    as that of Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in the
                    policy process often had to be pieced together from a variety of sources.</p>
                <p>Major topics covered in this volume include: 1) U.S. efforts to maintain the
                    cohesion of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance by avoiding
                    outbreaks of violence on Cyprus that would provoke clashes between Greece and
                    Turkey; 2) attempts of U.S. policymakers to devise a compromise solution for
                    Cyprus that would meet the requirements of its major regional partners; 3) a
                    growing U.S. involvement in Greece's internal politics as a result of a major
                    constitutional crisis between political forces led by George and <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> on one side and a
                    conservative coalition under the leadership of King Constantine II on the other;
                    and 4) the U.S reaction to the Greek military coup of April 1967 and imposition
                    of a dictatorship in Greece. Coverage of bilateral U.S.-Turkish relations
                    focuses on the Cyprus issue.</p>
                <p>The editor included a selection of intelligence estimates and analyses seen by
                    high-level policymakers, especially those that were made available to President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time or, in
                    the case of conferences, in the order of individual meetings. Memoranda of
                    conversation are placed according to the time and date of the conversation,
                    rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations,
                        <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII" facs="0007"/>which are described in the
                    footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to accepted conventions
                    for the publication of historical documents in the limitations of modern
                    typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for each document
                    included in the volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are retained
                    as found in the source text, except that obvious typographical errors are
                    silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in the source text are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words or phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    source text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of each
                    volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount of material not
                    declassified has been noted by indicating the number of lines or pages of source
                    text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for declassification purposes
                    have been accounted for and are listed by headings, source notes, and number of
                    pages not declassified in their chronological place. The amount of material
                    omitted from this volume because it was unrelated to the subject of the volume,
                    however, has not been delineated. All brackets that appear in the source text
                    are so identified by footnotes.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the document's source, original
                    classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also provides
                    the background of important documents and policies and indicates whether the
                    President or his major policy advisers read the document. Every effort has been
                    made to determine if a document has been previously published, and, if so, this
                    information has been included in the source footnote.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>

                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute, reviews records, advises, and makes
                    recommendations concerning the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.
                    The Advisory Committee monitors the overall compilation and editorial process of
                    the series and advises on all aspects of the preparation and declassification of
                    the series. Although the Advisory Committee does not <pb n="VIII" xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0008"/>attempt to review the contents of individual
                    volumes in the series, it does monitor the overall process and makes
                    recommendations on particular problems that come to its attention.</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee reviewed the declassification review decisions for this
                    volume.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Information Response Branch of the Office of IRM Programs and Services,
                    Bureau of Administration, Department of State, conducted the declassification
                    review of the documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in
                    accordance with the standards set forth in Executive Order 12958 on Classified
                    National Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>Under Executive Order 12958, specific information may be exempt from automatic
                    declassification after 25 years if its release could be expected to:</p>
                <p>1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or reveal information
                    about the application of an intelligence source or method, or reveal the
                    identity of a human intelligence source when the unauthorized disclosure of that
                    source would clearly and demonstrably damage the national security interests of
                    the United States;</p>
                <p>2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of weapons of
                    mass destruction;</p>
                <p>3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or
                    activities;</p>
                <p>4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the art
                    technology within the U.S. weapon system;</p>
                <p>5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;</p>
                <p>6) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair relations
                    between the United States and a foreign government, or seriously and
                    demonstrably undermine ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;</p>
                <p>7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the current
                    ability of U.S. Government officials to protect the President, Vice President,
                    and other officials for whom protection services, in the interest of national
                    security, are authorized;</p>
                <p>8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair current
                    national security emergency preparedness plans; or</p>
                <p>9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments regarding specific documents of those governments.</p>
                <p>The final declassification review of this volume, which began in 1993 and was
                    completed in 1999, resulted in the decision to withhold <pb n="IX" xml:id="pg_IX" facs="0009"/>about .4 percent of the documentation proposed
                    for publication; 1 document was withheld in full. A determination to acknowledge
                    discussions in Washington about a proposed covert operation was made by a
                    High-Level Panel consisting of senior officials from the Department of State,
                    the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The Panel's
                    determination was followed by the release of associated documentation proposed
                    for publication.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this volume and as a result of the declassification review process
                    described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented here
                    provide an accurate account of U.S. policy toward Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey
                    during the 1964–1968 period.</p>

                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete access to all the
                    retired records and papers of the Department of State: the central files of the
                    Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”) of the Department at
                    the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the Department's Executive
                    Secretariat, which contain the records of international conferences and
                    high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders by the President
                    and Secretary of State, and memoranda of conversations between the President and
                    Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the files of overseas diplomatic
                    posts. When this volume was being compiled, the Department of State records
                    consulted were still under the custody of the Department, and the footnotes
                    citing Department of State files suggest that the Department is the repository.
                    By the time of publication, however, all the Department's indexed central files
                    for these years have been permanently transferred to the National Archives and
                    Records Administration (Archives II) at College Park, Maryland. Many of the
                    Department's decentralized office (or lot) files covering this period, which the
                    National Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, are in the process of
                    being transferred from the Department's custody to Archives II.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series also have full
                    access to the papers of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                    and other White House foreign policy records. Presidential papers maintained and
                    preserved at the Presidential libraries include some of the most significant
                    foreign affairs-related documentation from the Department of State and other
                    Federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p>In preparing this volume, the editor made extensive use of Presidential papers
                    and other White House records at the <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon B.
                        Johnson</persName> Library. The bulk of the foreign policy records at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library are in the country files and other
                    component parts of the National Security File. The editor also made extensive
                    use of the Papers of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Robert Komer</persName>, two officials who were
                    deeply involved in policy-making for the region in the first half of the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> administration.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the leadership of the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library, the
                    Department of State historians had full access to the audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations.
                    These audiotapes include substantial numbers of telephone conversations between
                    President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, the President's Special Assistant
                    for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy, and key members of Congress. The
                    editor of this volume selected for publication five audiotapes of President
                        <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s telephone conversations
                    dealing with Cyprus. <pb n="XVI" xml:id="pg_XVI" facs="0016"/>The editor
                    prepared transcripts of all or parts of these conversations. Although the
                    transcripts give the substance of the conversations, readers are urged to
                    consult the recordings for a full appreciation of those dimensions that cannot
                    be captured fully in a transcription, such as the speakers' inflections and
                    emphases that may convey nuances of meaning.</p>
                <p>Second in importance only to the White House records at the
                        <persName>Johnson</persName> Library were the records of the Department of
                    State. Because White House interest in the region tended to be limited to
                    periods of crisis, the Ambassadors in the three countries played a major role in
                    the formulation of policy. The volume includes a large selection of telegraphic
                    correspondence between the Embassies and the Department of State. Telegrams also
                    provide the most complete and accurate record of the two Ball missions to the
                    region in the spring of 1964, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                        Acheson</persName>'s mediation effort on Cyprus that took place in Geneva in
                    the summer of 1964, and the Cyrus Vance mediation of November–December 1967.
                    Finally, U.S. reactions during recurrent crises in Cyprus and at the time of the
                    Greek coup and the December 1967 counter coup of King Constantine are most
                    thoroughly documented in telegraphic exchanges.</p>
                <p>The Department's central files contain the cable traffic recording U.S.
                    diplomatic relations with Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey; memoranda of diplomatic
                    conversations; and memoranda proposing action or providing information. Some
                    important documents are found only in the Department's lot files. The Conference
                    Files maintained by the Executive Secretariat contain briefing materials as well
                    as records of conversations. Documentation on initiatives that were not approved
                    is often found only in desk or bureau files. The Ball Papers include summaries
                    of telephone conversations and other useful documentation. Greek and Cyprus Desk
                    Files include a large selection of correspondence, especially the so-called
                    “Official Informal” letters that passed between diplomats in the field and the
                    Department of State's Office of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian Affairs (<gloss target="#t_GTI1">GTI</gloss>), which provide critical insights into
                    policy-making.</p>
                <p>The Central Intelligence Agency provides the Department of State historians
                    access to intelligence documents from records in its custody and at the
                    Presidential libraries. This access is arranged and facilitated by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s History Staff, part of the Center for the
                    Study of Intelligence, pursuant to a May 1992 memorandum of understanding.</p>
                <p>This volume includes a number of intelligence records. Among the intelligence
                    records reviewed for the volume were those in country and intelligence files at
                    the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library, the files of the Directors of Central
                    Intelligence especially <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">John McCone</persName>,
                        <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> intelligence reports and summaries,
                    retired files of the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    containing National Intelligence Estimates, and the <gloss target="#t_INR1">INR</gloss> Historical Files.</p>
                <pb n="XVII" xml:id="pg_XVII" facs="0017"/>
                <p>Almost all of this documentation has been made available for use in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the consent of the
                    agencies mentioned, the assistance of their staffs, and especially the
                    cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>
                <p>The following list identifies the particular files and collections used in the
                    preparation of this volume. The declassification and transfer to the National
                    Archives of the Department of State records is in process, and many of those
                    records are already available for public review at the National Archives. The
                    declassification review of other records is going forward in accordance with the
                    provisions of Executive Order 12958, under which all records over 25 years old,
                    except file series exemptions requested by agencies and approved by the
                    President, should be reviewed for declassification by 2000.</p>

                <p>In compliance with the Foreign Relations of the United States statute to include
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series comprehensive
                    documentation on major foreign policy decisions and actions, the editors have
                    sought to present essential documents regarding major covert actions and
                    intelligence activities. In order to provide readers with some organizational
                    context on how covert actions and special intelligence operations in support of
                    U.S. foreign policy were planned and approved within the U.S. Government, the
                    following note is offered. It describes, on the basis of previously-declassified
                    documents, the changing and developing procedures during the Truman, Eisenhower,
                    Kennedy, and <persName>Johnson</persName> Presidencies.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Management of Covert Actions in the Truman Presidency</p>
                <p>The Truman administration's concern over Soviet “psychological warfare” prompted
                    the new National Security Council to authorize, in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4–A of December 1947, the launching of peacetime covert action
                    operations. <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4–A made the Director of Central
                    Intelligence responsible for psychological warfare, establishing at the same
                    time the principle that covert action was an exclusively Executive Branch
                    function. The Central Intelligence Agency (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>)
                    certainly was a natural choice but it was assigned this function at least in
                    part because the Agency controlled unvouchered funds, by which operations could
                    be funded with minimal risk of exposure in Washington.<note n="1" xml:id="actionsstatementfn1">

                    <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s early use of its new covert action mandate
                    dissatisfied officials at the Departments of State and Defense. The Department
                    of State, believing this role too important to be left to the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> alone and concerned that the military might
                    create a new rival covert action office in the Pentagon, pressed to reopen the
                    issue of where responsibility for covert action activities should reside.
                    Consequently, on June 18, 1948, a new <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                    directive, <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, superseded <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 4–A.</p>
                <p>
                    <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2 directed <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> to conduct “covert” rather than merely “psychological”
                    operations, defining them as all activities “which are conducted or sponsored by
                    this Government against hostile foreign <pb n="XXXII" xml:id="pg_XXXII" facs="0032"/>states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or
                    groups but which are so planned and executed that any US Government
                    responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if
                    uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for
                    them.”</p>
                <p>The type of clandestine activities enumerated under the new directive included:
                    “propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage,
                    demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including
                    assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee
                    liberations [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] groups, and support of indigenous
                    anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world. Such
                    operations should not include armed conflict by recognized military forces,

                <p>The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), newly established in the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> on September 1, 1948, in accordance with <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 10/2, assumed responsibility for organizing and
                    managing covert actions. OPC, which was to take its guidance from the Department
                    of State in peacetime and from the military in wartime, initially had direct
                    access to the State Department and to the military without having to proceed
                    through <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s administrative hierarchy, provided
                    the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was informed of all important
                    projects and decisions.<note n="3" xml:id="actionsstatementfn3">Memorandum of

                <p>During the Korean conflict the OPC grew quickly. Wartime commitments and other
                    missions soon made covert action the most expensive and bureaucratically
                    prominent of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s activities. Concerned about
                    this situation, DCI Walter Bedell Smith in early 1951 asked the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> for enhanced policy guidance and a ruling on
                    the proper “scope and magnitude” of <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                    operations. The White House responded with two initiatives. In April 1951
                    President Truman created the Psychological Strategy Board (PSB) under the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> to coordinate government-wide psychological

                <p>The Eisenhower administration began narrowing <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s latitude in 1954. In accordance with a series of National
                    Security Council directives, the responsibility of the Director of Central
                    Intelligence for the conduct of covert operations was further clarified.

                    conducting covert actions abroad. A definition of covert actions was set forth;
                    the DCI was made responsible for coordinating with designated representatives of
                    the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that covert

                    considered on a case-by-case basis by the 303 Committee and its predecessors

                    low-cost operations. The Final Report also cited a February 1967 <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> memorandum that included a description of the

                    forms of indirect aggression in friendly countries.” The Special Group (CI) was
                    to confine itself to establishing broad policies and give oversight to country
                    or regional interagency task forces. An annex to NSAM No. 124 assigned Thailand,

                    1962, entitled “United States Overseas Internal Defense Policy.” The policy
                    expressed in the report, which was approved by President Kennedy in NSAM No.
                    182, included the presumption that counter-insurgency programs (referred to as
                    “internal defense programs” in the report) should not be limited to military
                    measures but should also involve as necessary such additional dimensions as
                    economic development, police control, and effective local government.<note n="15" xml:id="actionsstatementfn15">”United States Overseas Internal

                <p>In the course of its existence until 1966, Special Group (CI) spurred the
                    establishment of extensive training courses on counter-insurgency throughout the
                    government; promoted the responsibility of inter-agency “country teams” in the
                    countries concerned to develop “Internal Defense Plans;” examined and reshaped
                    programs for advising, supplying, and training paramilitary and military forces
                    in developing countries; encouraged the redirection and expansion of government

                <p>On October 15, 1963, General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>,
                    signing as Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, addressed a
                    memorandum to members of the Special Group (CI) entitled “U.S. Support of
                    Foreign Paramilitary Forces,” which concluded that U.S. policy to support the
                    Honduran Civil Guard had resulted in the overthrow of the constitutional
                    government. <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> observed that the
                    Honduras experience suggested that U.S. programs in other countries should be
                    reviewed to determine whether similar potentially dangerous situations were
                    being fostered, and he recommended that “interagency working groups which
                    monitor internal defense plans” review these programs and report to the Special
                    Group (CI).<note n="17" xml:id="actionsstatementfn17">Memorandum from <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to Special Group (CI), October 15,

                    coordination, and supervision of overseas affairs.” In NSAM No. 341, March 2,
                    1966, President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> assigned to the
                    Secretary of State the “authority and responsibility to the full extent

                        <p>The Ambassador said that the outlook both for the London conference<note n="2" xml:id="d1fn2">Reference is to the January 15–February 5
                                meeting of representatives of the Government of Cyprus, Turkish
                                Cypriots, and representatives of the three guarantor powers: Greece,
                                Turkey, and the United Kingdom.</note> and the situation on the
                            island was very black. The Greeks and Turks in London were poles apart,
                            and the Cypriot Turks were very nervous about their position. If there
                            were a breakdown in London and a flare-up in Cyprus, very strong
                            measures would have to be taken. He asked the Secretary's opinion on the
                            relative merits of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> “peace-keeping”
                            mission and a force drawn from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries. He mentioned that the Greek Foreign Minister had suggested a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied he wasn't fully advised on the question and could
                            not give a final answer now, but he could see advantages in discussing
                            it in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which might produce some
                            pressure on the Greeks and Turks. If the three guarantor powers plus
                            Cyprus so requested, he could see some advantage in using troops from
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers. He thought it would
                            probably be best not to have any such force under the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> label, but it might be better to draw
                            on the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations rather than put the
                            matter to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary said he
                            could give no answer on the question of a U.S. contingent. He pointed
                            out we have some 17,000 troops in Turkey and if our troops were in
                            Cyprus shooting at Turks, we might run into some serious trouble in
                            Turkey, <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0040"/>where they might begin
                            shooting at us. He also mentioned our interest in the security of our
                            important installations on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued he hoped they could keep talking in London. The
                            Ambassador reiterated that the situation in the island was bad and the
                            talks deadlocked. If fighting broke out Turkey might take some
                            precipitate action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWC1">Burdett</persName>
                            said that <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>'s feeling was that the
                            gravity of the situation and the many complications of using troops from
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries made it desirable
                            that Cyprus be a first priority for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            troops. The Secretary observed that there should be a note of caution on
                            priorities in view of the serious and spreading situation in East
                            Africa. If the situation quickly went bad <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops were the only and best way; but otherwise troops
                            from some <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries acceptable to
                            both the Greeks and Turks might be used. He mentioned Norway as an
                            example.</p>

                                situation on Cyprus. He informed U.S. representatives that the
                                British Government wanted to internationalize the problem either
                                through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or U.N. intervention

                            concerned. And that he wanted us to agree with them on a <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0041"/>proposal to try and internationalize the

                            could.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: I think that the British are getting to where they might as well
                            not be British anymore if they can't handle Cyprus.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, I've, they're—we put it to them very strong as to whether
                            this was on the basis that they were spread too thin in which case we
                            might relieve some of their forces from, even from Germany. But the—what
                                <persName corresp="#p_GSDOLH1">Ormsby Gore</persName> says—and this
                            checks with our own advice—is that putting additional British forces in
                            is probably just going to make the situation worse rather than
                            better.</p>
                        <p>Now, I'm meeting with Bob McNamara at five o'clock.<note n="4" xml:id="d2fn4">See <ref target="#d3fn2">footnote 2, Document

                        <p> GWB: We'll have a recommendation—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: —and I would say off-hand that I would have <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>—try to get <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in there. And I think the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s out, but I'd tell the British that there might as well
                            not be a Britain anymore if they can't handle Cyprus.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Right. Well, this is—what we're taking a hard look at—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: And I'd let them relieve whatever they needed in Germany to put
                            there rather than <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But they won't
                            do it, then we go to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. I don't
                            agree that it's going to make it worse, because they can—I'm ashamed of
                            them, but go ahead and let's take <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, we'll have a recommendation for you. Bob and I are getting

                        <p>Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reviewed the
                            current situation in Cyprus and the British request that we send U.S.
                            troops as part of an allied force to Cyprus.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3">See <ref target="#d2fn3">footnote 3, Document 2</ref>.</note> The
                            discussion centered around the attached draft telegram<note n="4" xml:id="d3fn4">Not found.</note> as being the preferred course of
                            action because of disadvantages associated with taking the question to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or taking it to the North Atlantic
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reviewed for the
                            President the planning which had been done in the State and Defense
                            Departments since the British démarche. He recalled that the British had
                            been told of our great reluctance to consider the use of U.S. combat
                            troops, but that the British Prime Minister had again requested us to
                            participate in an allied force as the only way to alter a rapidly
                            deteriorating situation in Cyprus which the British were not prepared to
                            continue to deal with alone.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said an appeal to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been ruled out as the worst
                            possible alternative. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might set up
                            a peacekeeping force which would be beyond our control and in which the
                            Russians and the Yugoslavs would undoubtedly want to participate. A
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> solution was not possible
                            because Cyprus is not a member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            even though, <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0043"/>if the worst happened,
                            two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would be fighting each
                            other. The tripartite negotiations of the three guarantor powers, U.K.,
                            Greece and Turkey, have broken down in London. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> is in charge of a weak government
                            in Ankara and may have trouble keeping civilian control of the Turkish
                            military. In Athens, where there is a caretaker government, there may be
                            a military coup. The prospect of such a coup would be greatly increased
                            by serious fighting in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> recommended that we ask
                            the British government to send a ranking military officer to Washington
                            tomorrow in order to obtain more information about their proposed allied
                            intervention force. He said the group would postpone until tomorrow at
                            least making a recommendation on whether or not we should join the U.K.
                            in seeking to establish a military force composed of troops from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries. He suggested that the
                            President might want to talk to the leaders of Congress tomorrow. He
                            summarized the guidelines which would govern our participation in an
                            allied force as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The U.S. would make a token contribution—a battalion of 1200 men.</p>
                        <p>2. The bulk of the force would be British.</p>
                        <p>3. Two other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would make
                            token contributions equal to the U.S. contribution.</p>
                        <p>4. The force would not go into Cyprus until it was large enough to be
                            “adequate” to the need. We do not now know whether the British figure of
                            10,000 men would be adequate.</p>
                        <p>5. The military mission of the force would be specifically defined. The
                            British would command the force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> discussed whether General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> should go to
                            Ankara and later to Athens. He said the Turkish military may move in the
                            next two or three days. The Turks have promised us that they will
                            consult before they intervene in Cyprus. But if there were a massacre
                            involving a large number of Turkish Cypriots, the Turkish military might
                            jump off immediately. The civil government in Turkey is very weak and
                            the military may force its hand.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> may on his own
                            take the case to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council.
                            We doubt that any serious resolution could come out of the Security
                            Council unless major fighting broke out or unless the Turkish government
                            intervened militarily.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> has reported
                            that the British consider the Cyprus situation more serious and much
                            more important than the Malaysia crisis. They recall the agony of the
                            last time they attempted to keep peace in Cyprus. They have two major
                            bases in Cyprus which they intend to defend. If civil strife outside the
                            bases becomes too great for them to handle, their present plan is to
                            withdraw their troops within the bases and wait out the situation. If
                            major reenforcements of British troops were sent to Cyprus, the
                            Conservatives know that they would be <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0044"/>severely attacked by the Labor Party in an election
                            period. The British are also sensitive to the fact that they were the
                            colonial power prior to their withdrawal from Cyprus and that,
                            therefore, they are a hostage to the past.</p>
                        <p>The President said if the British had election problems, he had problems
                            with the U.S. citizens of Greek background.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that the Greek
                            Government had favored the intervention of allied forces.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the fact that our elections are coming and that
                            the prospect of sending U.S. troops into Cyprus is one to face only as a
                            last resort.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the
                            unfortunate part of the situation was that the only solution to the
                            problem in Cyprus was to force the Greek Cypriots to do something they
                            did not want to do, namely, not increase their control over the Turkish
                            Cypriots by revising the existing Constitution and agreements.</p>
                        <p>The President asked everyone to go slow on any plan to use U.S. troops in
                            Cyprus. He said there is nothing we can do which will not end up in our
                            losing. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> acknowledged
                            that there was no good solution to the problem. He said that if it were
                            necessary to reenforce the original U.S. complement, all participants
                            would contribute to the reenforcement in the same percentage. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that if we do
                            go in, the percentage of our participation is the extent of our share of
                            the operation. He thought that 6500 men would have to be put in by
                            others and he did not know where these troops were coming from. Our
                            share would be no more than 1200 men.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that if we do
                            put in our troops, we would provide our own supplies and our own
                            logistic backup. We would ask that each participant do the same.</p>
                        <p>The President said that perhaps we would have to go through a blood bath
                            in Cyprus before we could take any U.S. military action. He asked
                            whether it were not possible for someone else to go in, such as a
                            neutral or Nasser.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> responded by saying that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> wants a neutral
                            such as Nasser or a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group with
                            neutrals because he is convinced that the neutrals will favor him over
                            the Turks in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The President said General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> could tell the Turks not to go into Cyprus and
                            the same thing to the Greeks. We have been holding up numerous
                            situations around the world and we are not going to walk out, but we
                            don't expect others to walk out either. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> should tell <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> how we feel. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> also talk to the military
                            directly because <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> may not be
                            in full control of the Turkish military.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0045"/>
                        <p>The President said we should give no encouragement to the U.K. to think
                            that we would join in an allied force. He then asked what would happen
                            if we did not go in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that the
                            situation might blow up with the result that two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies would be fighting each other.
                            It was also possible that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would ask the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            to come in and a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping force
                            would have Communist elements in it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> pointed out
                            that the Greeks in Cyprus outnumber the Turks four to one. He repeated
                            his earlier statement that a political settlement would mean forcing the
                            Greeks to do something they did not now wish to do.</p>
                        <p>The President asked what else we could do—was a conference possible?
                            Could we get people discussing their problems around a table? Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that the London
                            tripartite conference had blown up. The U.S. had no status in that
                            conference because it was composed of the three guarantor powers. It is
                            difficult to talk to the Greeks and the Turks because of the weakness of
                            these governments. The views of the Greeks and the Turks are more
                            crystallized and farther apart as the result of the conference in London
                            than before.</p>
                        <p>The President said it would be necessary to shove him very hard to get
                            him to agree to send U.S. troops to Cyprus. We must do more in a
                            diplomatic way than we have so far.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that both the
                            Turkish and Greek Foreign Ministers were in London and it would be
                            possible for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> to
                            talk to them there.<note n="5" xml:id="d3fn5">

                        <p>At approximately 6:35 p.m., January 28, 1964, Acting Secretary of State
                            George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> with the outline of a
                            “plan” for Cyprus that would involve sending to Cyprus a contingent of
                            1,200 U.S. soldiers as part of a 10,000-man <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> peacekeeping force designed to facilitate mediation of
                            the crisis by separating the warring parties. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> indicated that the plan had the
                            approval of Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. The President expressed continued skepticism
                            about the utility of sending U.S. troops to the island:</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Why do we want to put something in?</p>
                        <p> GWB: I think that, the word we've had all through the day is that
                            there's danger of a blow up. That the situation.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: That's the danger. They're just trying to make us move and get into
                            something we can't get out of, I think.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, the point of this plan is that if we move in a very limited
                            liability manner.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: I'd like to move you or <persName corresp="#p_HWA1">Harriman</persName> or somebody—Bobby Kennedy, or Bob McNamara or
                            somebody—I'd like to move them over there and let them make an all out
                            diplomatic effort. Maybe put an airplane carrier or two there, but not.
                            That island's already overcrowded.</p>
                        <p>In response <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stressed that the
                            United States should avoid becoming the mediator in Cyprus: “Anyone who
                            settles this is going to come down hard on the Greeks.” The United
                            States should stay in the background. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then outlined a proposal for a Western European
                            mediator, a 3-month cease-fire to permit mediation to proceed, and the
                            inclusion of a 1,200 man U.S. contingent in the peacekeeping force.
                            After answering a number of questions regarding the activities of U.S.
                            officials, the President authorized further exploration of the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> plan.

                        <p> ALO 17. 1. I arrived in Athens at 1145 local, 29 January, where I was
                            met by General Pipilis, Chief of the Defense General Staff, and the
                            various service chiefs. After a short press conference at the airport
                            with a large number of press, I departed for a conference with Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> with the
                            understanding that General Pipilis was to accompany me. When we arrived
                            in the Prime Minister's office, Pipilis was summarily dismissed, and the
                            conference, which lasted about an hour, consisted only of the Prime
                            Minister with an interpreter and myself and my executive officer. As a
                            result of his dismissal from my conference with the Prime Minister,
                            General Pipilis later expressed the fear that the Prime Minister might
                            be pursuing a different line than the Defense Ministry and my executive
                            officer was specifically queried by him regarding content of the Prime
                            Minister's remarks.</p>
                        <p>2. After lunch with Defense Minister Papanikolopoulos and the Chiefs of
                            Staff, I had a two-hour discussion with them at the Defense Ministry,
                            followed by a one-hour conference with the Crown Prince substituting for
                            his father, who was ill. All parties concerned voiced views which were
                            substantially the same.</p>
                        <p>3. In opening all my conferences, I explained the purpose of my visit
                            along the same lines as I had the day before with the Turks,<note n="2" xml:id="d5fn2">

                                talks with Turkish officials in an unnumbered telegram to Secretary

                                29. (Ibid.)</note> highlighting, of course, the disastrous
                            consequences of a military clash over Cyprus between two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies.</p>
                        <p>4. The common thread which the Greeks pursued in all of our conversations
                            was that the Turks were determined to abrogate the 1955 treaty<note n="3" xml:id="d5fn3">Apparently a reference to the 1959 agreements
                                establishing an independent Cyprus; for texts, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents, 1959</hi>, pp.
                                765–775.</note> and that they would settle for nothing less than
                            full self-determination for Turkish Cypriots and partition of the island
                            of Cyprus. Furthermore, the Greeks maintained that the Turks were
                            pushing things to an explosive state by their large concentration of
                            forces at Iskenderun and by their continuing inflammatory remarks in the
                            state-controlled press and radio. As a consequence, Greek public opinion
                            has been <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0048"/>greatly aroused and has
                            now reached the fever pitch of 1940 when neither the King, nor the
                            government, nor anyone else, could hold the Greek people in check.</p>
                        <p>5. To reduce these tensions and to resolve the current crisis, the
                            Defense Minister listed the following requirements:</p>
                        <p>a. Dispersion of the heavy concentration of forces in southern Turkey,
                            or, failing that,</p>
                        <p>b. Introduction of an allied force to Cyprus of sufficient size to
                            maintain peace and security.</p>
                        <p>c. Stationing of the Sixth Fleet around Cyprus to police the waters and
                            prevent a Turkish invasion.</p>
                        <p>6. Of these requirements, the dispersal of Turkish forces at Iskenderun
                            is regarded by the Greeks as the most imperative and the most immediate
                            since they look upon this concentration as a Sword of Damocles which
                            could prevent any productive steps. If however, none of the requirements
                            is met, then the Greeks would be compelled to take prompt
                            counter-action. The precise nature of this counter-action was not
                            disclosed.</p>
                        <p>7. With regard to the allied force, Greece is quite willing to withdraw
                            its forces from Cyprus if the Turks will do likewise. In response to my
                            specific question as to whether they would object to leaving both
                            Turkish and Greek forces there if an allied force went in, the Defense
                            Minister responded that he would have no objection to this if it were
                            necessary. As to command of the allied force, the Defense Minister
                            stated that the question had not been thoroughly studied but that they
                            would prefer to see an American commander.</p>
                        <p>8. I informed the Greeks that I had been notified through appropriate
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Commanders of Turkish movement
                            of forces and that I was convinced that I would continue to be kept
                            informed. I stated that even though naval units of both Greece and
                            Turkey were not under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> command, I
                            had received notification of the movement of Turkish naval units from
                            the Black Sea to Iskenderun. With regard to the build-up of ground
                            forces, I stated that there was not any repositioning of additional
                            combat units in the Iskenderun area, but that any increase in combat
                            strength there related only to the build-up to 100 percent strength of
                            the 39th Division which was normally based at Iskenderun. I stressed the
                            importance of Greece following the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            procedures for reporting and consultation and was assured that such
                            procedures would be followed and that, in no case, would Greece take any
                            unilateral action without prior consultation.</p>
                        <p>9. In general, I did not find Greek officials as calm as the Turks.
                            Emotion is running high, aggravated by a sense of frustration stemming
                            from the all-too-obvious military advantages of the Turks in the Cyprus
                            area and the feeling among the military that they cannot look to their
                                <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0049"/>caretaker government for
                            decisive leadership. On the other hand, they gave every indication that
                            they sincerely hope to find a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem.
                            The disadvantages under which they labor are likely to militate against
                            any precipitate, unilateral moves by Greece.</p>
                        <p>10. I departed Athens at 1830 local and arrived in Paris at 0100 30 Jan.
                            En route I stopped at Naples for a conference with Admiral Russell to

                        <p>Their worry over getting relief supplies through can be alleviated more
                            rapidly by getting the international force on the island immediately
                            rather than haggling over terms of reference. We cannot understand their

                            place in Cyprus. There is nothing in the proposal in our view that
                            prejudices either Turkey's treaty rights or the position of the Vice

                            reference to “Government <pb n="13" xml:id="pg_13" facs="0051"/>of
                            Cyprus”, existence of which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> does not
                            recognize, should just refer to Archbishop Makarios and Dr Kucuk by name
                            (para numbered four of Embtel). I commented along following lines:</p>
                        <p>1) Revision of proposals made with Turkish interests in mind and
                            represents no derogation of them.</p>
                        <p>2) <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> may have problems re proposals but
                            so do we. Matter is urgent and if time lost discussing detailed points
                            whole effort could collapse, including our own steps to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>3) Purpose of presenting revised proposals was to obtain <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> acquiescence in order present them to
                            Cypriots. In so doing we of course expected <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would make comments and observations as Greeks had done
                            but I trusted these would not involve changes in document itself but
                            would rather be for information and clarification.</p>
                        <p>4) Point re general validity of treaty provisions represents no
                            substantive problem since it has been our view from beginning that
                            proposals do not affect such provisions. We have so stated repeatedly
                            and I could now say so again under authority of message from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5) Point re “Government of Cyprus” was quite another matter since,
                            regardless of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> reservations, we just
                            could not put ourselves in position of challenging legal status of GOC.
                            We recognize that GOC not functioning normally but that is practical,
                            not legal, consideration. Fact that proposals had been submitted to
                            Kucuk as well as <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was
                            illustrative this point.</p>
                        <p>At end, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> reply would cover number of points,
                            including proposed revisions of text but that point regarding general
                            application of treaty provisions was most important.</p>
                        <p>Referring to my previous warning re danger of delay involved in
                            redrafting, I asked whether these suggestions would be in the form of
                            requirements for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> acquiescence or as
                            expression of what they would want if possible arrange. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> replied that we would be given
                            paper and would be up to us what to do with it. I asked what this meant
                            in terms of submission of proposals to GOC. To be specific, could paper
                            go forward even if decided changes inadvisable? <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> replied “What else can you
                            do?”</p>
                        <p>This not too satisfactory but better than expected. At any rate your
                            message afforded timely opportunity to get crack at <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> and give him time do a little
                            thinking before seeing him this afternoon.</p>

                        <p>3824. Following is uncleared memcon of Under Sec <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s talk with Cypriot FonMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>:</p>
                        <p>1. Under Sec and Amb <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName> met
                            1730 today with <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> at
                            AmEmbassy. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> was
                            accompanied by Cyprus <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss> in London
                            Soteriades. Under Sec explained US concern with Cyprus problem prompted
                            primarily by our concern with peace. We believe establishment
                            peace-keeping force, coupled with mediator concept, offers best way to
                            proceed. US participation in force depends on working out acceptable
                            arrangements to avoid entangling problem in cold war and on willingness
                            of GOC to accept and request such force. Under Sec asked for GOC's frank
                            views re US participation.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> affirmed GOC reply
                            given earlier remains basic GOC view.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">In a
                                February 2 statement to the London conference, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> announced that the
                                Government of Cyprus accepted the idea of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> peacekeeping force in principle, but insisted that
                                it operate under the authority of the United Nations. Subsequently,
                                President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> outlined
                                further objections to a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force
                                under U.N. aegis. For text of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' February 4 statement, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1964</hi>, p. 557.</note> GOC has no objection in principle to
                            participation by any country. It is not the force that will provide
                            permanent peace. If it is necessary have such a force because <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> not prepared assume full responsibility,
                            GOC believes it should be under Security Council. GOC has no wish create
                            further complications. In its view, however, such force needed primarily
                            for external purposes. Once danger of intervention is removed,
                            atmosphere will automatically improve. Greeks will know no need exists
                            to prepare for invasion; Turks will know they cannot hope for
                            intervention. Influence and interference of outsiders primarily
                            responsible for present troubled situation. Turkey more to blame than
                            Greece. While primary purpose of such force should be to deter outside
                            aggression, internal peace-keeping obviously also desirable. Force
                            should assist GOC restore normal conditions.</p>
                        <p>3. If these are to be missions of force, it preferable force be under
                            Security Council. Cyprus is small country with bitter past experience.
                            If force under Security Council aegis, Cypriot public opinion will find
                            it much more palatable. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            stressed GOC not trying blackmail. It remains ready discuss question
                            before going to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Once agreement
                            reached on composition of force, GOC wonders why US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> should consider it dangerous go to
                            Security Council.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0053"/>
                        <p>4. Under Sec explained part of problem revolves about meaning of “under
                            Security Council.” We do not object to some connection with Security
                            Council. We are seeking work out with other objective and competent
                            countries establishment of force able to provide both power and a
                            psychological framework designed to restore calm while political
                            solution is being sought. Rather than inject question of composition of
                            force into cold war politics at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, we
                            believe composition should be pre-arranged before going to Security
                            Council. Formula by which link with Security Council is established is
                            important. We do not wish make force subject of Soviet veto. Also, it is
                            impractical to organize force if Security Council is going to be asked
                            finance it because of already existing controversy revolving about
                            Article 19. To get into this range of questions will merely delay its
                            organization. We think it possible agree with GOC on a force where each
                            participating govt pays its own way. We would also agree with GOC on
                            what nations should participate. Thereafter, we see no reason why matter
                            could not be brought to Security Council in manner where Soviet veto and
                            cold war confrontation are avoided.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> disclaimed GOC
                            responsibility for present situation. He then alluded to various other
                            factors which allegedly increased tension. Manner in which proposal
                            prepared and projected in Cyprus, with other nations and press
                            apparently apprised before GOC, increased suspicions. Under Sec noted
                            original idea was Greek. HMG had called Greek proposal to our attention.
                            In order to test its feasibility, we have explored it with other govts.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> insisted GOC equally
                            interested party and should have been consulted earlier. Greeks had told
                            GOC it was not their proposal, although GOC knows it was. With respect
                            to force itself, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said
                            once agreement is reached on composition, GOC wants to go to Security
                            Council. It would explain its desire is to place pre-arranged force
                            under Security Council control. He wondered if Soviets would in fact
                            veto such force since they appear to be trying assist GOC.</p>
                        <p>6. Under Sec pointed out “under Security Council” can embrace Security
                            Council “taking note,” “reporting,” etc. What did GOC have in mind?
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied Security
                            Council should authorize <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to have the
                            right to control the force within the scope of agreed terms of
                            reference. Security Council should be competent to take decisions with
                            respect to the force if called upon to do so by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>, GOC or the participating countries. The Security
                            Council might also have the mission of working out terms of reference
                            for the force. He envisaged a two-stage procedure. The Security Council
                            should first pass a resolution asking all states to refrain from
                            threatening independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of
                            Cyprus. GOC would inform Security Council that talks are also taking
                            place on the composition of a force about which it would report back to
                            Security Council once agreement is reached. Such procedure <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0054"/>would have a calming effect in Cyprus.
                            Security Council endorsement, in GOC's view, is a deterrent. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> added he was thinking of going
                            to New York on Wednesday or Thursday to initiate Security Council
                            action, although his trip might be postponed until Saturday. Under Sec
                            said we will have to examine <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s idea. Meanwhile, he hoped we might move
                            forward on composition and terms of reference of force.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> also suggested <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> might, even in absence any specific
                            proposal, go to Cyprus himself for a day. He need have no specific
                            mission, but would simply seek inform himself of situation. This too
                            would have calming effect. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said he had instructed Rossides to sound out
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> on this. Did we have any
                            objection?</p>
                        <p>Under Sec said he would want to consider this further with his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> experts. His initial impression was that
                            there should be no objection.</p>
                        <p>8. With respect to US participation, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> thought this would be inadvisable. GOC would
                            not object, but US participation would adversely affect the “popularity”
                            of the US in Cyprus and could give rise to public feelings against the
                            US. Under Sec pointed out that we must consider if any force can in fact
                            be organized on viable basis if US does not participate. If force could
                            be organized without us, we would prefer it. We have been inclined to
                            doubt that it can. Many nations who speak boldly of peace-keeping force
                            become less so when it comes to paying for it. Some states have said
                            they will join only if US does so. In any case, there is no intention of
                            taking any action without full agreement of GOC.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> contended that,
                            psychologically, if force had come in context of political settlement,
                            it might not have been viewed differently in Cyprus. Fact is, however,
                            that it developed while London talks were taking place, thereby
                            heightening Cypriot suspicions. He asked Under Sec if US has formed any
                            views re political settlement.</p>
                        <p>Under Sec replied that on basis our knowledge of Cyprus situation, we
                            have not felt able to contribute any useful suggestions at this time.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> then asked what
                            purpose of mediator would be? Under Sec pointed out it was not proposed
                            he try to put American ideas into effect. His task would be to sound out
                            all interested parties and seek to persuade them come to some mutually
                            agreeable settlement. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            was skeptical about mediator's prospects. He opined that if there were
                            some way to get Greece and Turkey out of picture, chances of success
                            would be greater. He recalled that ten years ago enosis might have been
                            better arrangement. Through no fault of Greek Cypriots, it could not be
                            worked out. Such “radical solution” probably not possible now.</p>
                        <p>10. Under Sec told <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> he
                            planned meet with <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> again
                            and, together with <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>, might
                            perhaps be able to hold second meeting with <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> later. During subsequent talk with <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName>, it became clear that further
                            discussions with Greeks desirable before saying anything <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0055"/>more to <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>. Under Sec then telephoned <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> to explain his inability meet
                            with him again today and his wish to reflect further on <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s observations. Under Sec said
                            he hoped be in Nicosia sometime Tuesday and suggested <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> might wish to consider meeting
                            him there. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> will probably
                            do so.</p>

                                view that the United States should not put troops in Cyprus and
                                should avoid taking a firm public position on the issue so that the
                                United Kingdom, Greece, or Turkey would not back off from their

                        <p>1. I am now even firmer in my view that the US should not put troops in
                            Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName> (who supports

                                would fail to win Cypriot acceptance and urged U.S. support of a
                                peacekeeping force under U.N. aegis with the participation of forces
                                from both Greece and Turkey. (Department of State, Central Files,

                            are all convinced <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> does
                            not want Americans. They fear US forces would be special target of hit
                            and run tactics of Greek Cypriots. According to <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName>, Pickard also agrees that US
                            troops would be singled out more than other Western powers because of
                            our position of leadership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>We explored possible ways that US military support might be provided
                            while minimizing exposure of US forces on assumption some form of US
                            involvement may be useful or even necessary to keep Turks from standing
                            down. This included possibility of putting US troops in <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0056"/>British bases on standby basis. However,
                            we concluded this not desirable since US unit would be thrown into
                            breach at such time as serious fighting broke out, which would be worse
                            than being in from beginning.</p>
                        <p>2. Today's discussion highlighted importance and delicacy of handling
                            Turks so as to minimize adverse repercussions on our relations and to
                            dampen any desire they may have to intervene in Cyprus unilaterally. As
                            a result, it is more than ever important that responsibility for our
                            non-participation be placed squarely on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' back. As Hare puts it, US failure to
                            participate in an international force would remove keystone to arch, so
                            far as Turks are concerned.</p>
                        <p>It seems increasingly likely that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will cooperate with us on this since opinion of
                            our Nicosia [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] is that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could not survive acceptance of US troops. He
                            believes Cypriot “fighters” would throw him out if he tried it.</p>
                        <p>3. What are the alternatives to plan as presently agreed by all but GOC?
                            We concluded best alternative we can probably hope to achieve is modest
                            international force under <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> com and made
                            up of Benelux, Scandinavian countries, Canada and possibly Ireland.</p>
                        <p>Force would be approved by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> but not put
                            under its control. While such force not as effective militarily as
                            original concept, it would provide political deterrent and help spread
                            responsibility as <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> desires. If
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> wants such a
                            force—and there is still real doubt that he wants any international
                            force at all—a prearranged deal along these lines might be feasible.
                            Hare is clear, however, that this fallback—while probably the best we
                            can hope for—would cause Turks great anguish.</p>
                        <p>4. If we are to keep the Turks from feeling we have sold them down the
                            river, we must make strongest effort to avoid any suggestion we are
                            weakening in our decision to contribute US contingent to international
                            force. Any leak or suggestion from any US source indicating such
                            weakening would be catastrophic.<note n="4" xml:id="d9fn4">In telegram

                            GOC was planning—before dealing with question of international force—to
                            seek Security Council confirmation of “territorial integrity and
                            independence of Cyprus”. This was confirmed by Greek FonMin this
                                afternoon<note n="5" xml:id="d9fn5">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reported on his meeting

                                in telegram 1199 from Athens, February 10. (Ibid.)</note> who added
                            information that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            planned to go personally to New York for that purpose but had agreed to
                            defer this junket until after Greek election next Sunday (February 16).
                            I described to FonMin how I am tentatively planning to deal with this
                            proposal when I meet <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.
                            However, I would <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0057"/>appreciate
                            suggestion of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and Department as to best tactic. I have in
                            mind saying following to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>:</p>
                        <p>a. We have been the major support of the United Nations from the
                            beginning while certain other nations that make great pretense of
                            interest in Cypriot situation have consistently sabotaged <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and failed to provide financial support
                            for its peacekeeping efforts.</p>
                        <p>b. We are practical nation and trust that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will take a hard look at the practical
                            consequences of his proposed action.</p>
                        <p>c. A move toward the Security Council on this issue will almost certainly
                            result in the interjection of cold war politics. It will provide the
                            forum for charges of genocide against Cypriots while speeches in
                            Security Council will only serve to inflame passions that are already
                            too high.</p>
                        <p>d. We must concentrate on first things first and that means getting
                            agreement on international force before involving Security Council.</p>
                        <p>Obviously this ploy may not work. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> apparently has naive idea that Security Council
                            is like General Assembly and filled with Afro-Asian pals. If he insists
                            on going ahead, however, we could probably not frontally oppose kind of
                            resolution Cypriots have in mind. We should seek to finesse it by
                            developing formulation we could support. In that event, each member of
                            Council would put its own interpretation on language. Net result might
                            be resolution putting Security Council on record that all parties
                            concerned must keep their shirts on and avoid action that would
                            exacerbate situation.</p>
                        <p>6. We also grappled briefly and inconclusively with nature of long-term
                            settlement. All were in full agreement we should not get into middle of
                            mediating process. If there is a solution it is certainly not in sight
                            in near future. Movement of population within federation seems offer
                            some possibility but has the great draw-back of being rational and
                            therefore not feasible. Best we can hope for in foreseeable future is to
                            help keep lid on boiling cauldron and thus prevent southern wing of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> from blowing up.</p>
                        <p>Tomorrow I go to Ankara to begin process of preparing Turks for turn down
                            by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and possible modest
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force alternative described
                            above.</p>

                        <p>1017. From Under Secretary. We met this morning first with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> and then went with
                            him for session with PM <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. In
                            both cases, I explained our interest in problem of Cyprus, our concern
                            over its dangers and our support for peacekeeping-mediator proposals. At
                            same time I made clear we and other non-guarantor powers could only
                            participate if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> agreed,
                            and I indicated considerable concern at what I understood to be his
                            rather negative attitude. Said I was going to Nicosia tomorrow and
                            intended to press hard for his agreement. They asked what could be done
                            if he refused, to which I replied that this would depend upon nature of
                            his refusal. We had no specific present plans in this regard.</p>
                        <p>I also discussed report that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> plans to appeal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> after Greek elections are over and seek resolution
                            warning against aggression or interference with independence and
                            territorial integrity of Cyprus. Assured them I intended try to dissuade
                            him from this and make point that there should be reference to Security
                            Council only after full agreement reached among parties concerned. Turks
                            agreed premature Security Council debate would be harmful and wished me
                            well in my efforts.</p>
                        <p>I emphasized that continuing tense situation on island and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' idea of rushing to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> made it imperative for us to get quick
                            decision and that I would work hard to this end. Was prepared stay over
                            day or two in Nicosia if satisfactory answer not forthcoming
                            tomorrow.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> asked about Greek position.
                            I said they supported peacekeeping plan but had told me they had little
                            influence on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> questioned latter statement, but
                            we said our own information from various sources confirmed it. He
                            commented some Greek moves had been displeasing to Turkey, but
                            government exercised restraint despite heavy pressures on it to act,
                            including severe criticism by Parliamentary opposition. I said we
                            appreciated this and told him Greek Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> had himself expressed
                            admiration for restraint displayed by <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>.</p>

                            would get, because <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            associates have “no scruples left”. <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> added, Turks have no confidence in guarantee
                            enforced solely by British, although British have enough troops on
                            island for purpose. Problem was British instructions to their troops.
                            They were instructed not to shoot but confine themselves to giving
                            advice which was not enough. Asked if British could not be induced to
                            act more effectively, I said I would talk to them about it.</p>
                        <p>They asked for our suggestions for proposed mediator, and I mentioned

                            time positions. Inonu said he was not familiar with first three names
                            but made no suggestions of his own. Expressed hope man chosen would have

                            State and Defense and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> from Under Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. In the last few days, we have succeeded in clearing our Cyprus
                            proposals with the British, Greek and Turkish Governments. This has
                            required a substantial output of persuasion.</p>
                        <p>2. I spent the day today largely with Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and his colleagues. I had two
                            long meetings—one this morning and one this afternoon.<note n="2" xml:id="d11fn2">Detailed reports of the morning discussions were
                                transmitted in telegrams 726 and 727 from Nicosia, February 12.

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> with an
                                “adjusted proposal.” The text of this proposal was transmitted in
                                circular telegram 1482, February 12. (Ibid.) The Embassy provided a
                                detailed report on the afternoon discussions in telegrams 728 and
                                731 from Nicosia, February 12. (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> presented <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> with the text of the Cypriot proposal

                                with Vice President Kuchuk in the interval between his two sessions

                                reported on this meeting in telegram 729 from Nicosia, February 12.

                        </p>
                        <p>3. While we were meeting, fighting was going on at various points in the
                            island yielding a number of dead and wounded, both Greek and Turk. This
                            is a daily occurrence. Cyprus is a battlefield. We travel about Nicosia
                            with police escorts, followed by RAF units with sub-machine guns. There
                            is a pervasive atmosphere of imminent crisis.</p>
                        <p>4. Our morning meeting consisted largely of my own long and hard-boiled
                            presentation. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> seemed
                            willing to consider our proposal. This afternoon the psychotic element
                            in the Cyprus drama fully emerged and the atmosphere chilled.</p>
                        <p>5. At the conclusion of lengthy technical discussions, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> indicated that in spite of my
                            most vigorous arguments he was going ahead with his foolish plan of
                            sending an expedition to ask the Security Council to try to undermine
                            the Treaties of Guarantee by seeking a resolution reaffirming the
                            territorial integrity and political independence of Cyprus. He indicated
                            quite casually that he would deal with the creation of an international
                            force at some later date.</p>
                        <p>6. In view of the fact that the murder rate is rising steadily and that
                            the tempo of fighting is increasing, such conduct by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is criminally foolhardy.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0061"/>
                        <p>7. In view of this, the British High Commissioner and I told off
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and his extremist
                            ministers in a manner unfamiliar to diplomatic discourse. In an exchange
                            which lasted 45 minutes or more, we painted a lurid picture of the
                            consequences that would entail from the folly he has proposed.</p>
                        <p>8. When the discussion got past the boiling point, I proposed that we
                            adjourn until Thursday morning, to which the Archbishop agreed.</p>
                        <p>9. I think we shook the Archbishop. Even his beard seemed pale. But the
                            big question is whether he is really in command of the situation. The
                            two ministers who led the discussion on the Cypriot side—<persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>—are fanatical and over the edge.
                            They reflect the death wish that seems endemic in this wretched island.
                            Both also have some Communist coloration in their backgrounds.</p>
                        <p>10. The question we face tonight is who is in charge? If the Archbishop
                            is as scared as I think he is, we may be able to salvage something
                            tomorrow morning. I plan to see him alone before the meeting. But if he
                            is a prisoner of his own folly—which seems likely—he will commit Cyprus
                            in the morning to a disaster course.</p>
                        <p>11. The issue that must be faced is the only simple question in this
                            complex situation. Is the Cypriot Government prepared to work with us
                            and other countries in organizing an international force immediately? Or
                            does it want to throw the issues into the United Nations in the hope of
                            attracting enough Soviet bloc and Afro-Asian support to embarrass the
                            Turks while the island continues to fall apart?</p>
                        <p>12. As of tonight, Cyprus is very near civil disintegration. I talked
                            with the Commander of the British Forces, General Young, this noon and
                            he felt despondent and frustrated: A battle occurred today in a town
                            that has heretofore been quiet; something on the order of 5,000 Turks
                            are encircled. There have been casualties on both sides. The pace is
                            accelerating and a general bloodbath just over the horizon.</p>
                        <p>13. Against this background, I told <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that if he did not proceed immediately to
                            organize an international peace force, he would condemn his country to
                            total anarchy. But I have little confidence that he is enough of a free
                            man to act rationally—even if he had the will to do so.</p>
                        <p>14. I have sent him word through covert channels that if he would agree
                            to the organization of an international force immediately, we and the
                            British would help him achieve one. We would call on the Commonwealth
                            countries and on some of the Western European neutrals. If he would
                            postpone throwing his problems into the Security Council until after
                            such a force had been agreed, order might be restored and the situation
                            salvaged. In that event, we would talk to the Turks and try to hold up
                            their hand while efforts were made to develop a formula for a general
                            settlement. Such a force cld not involve US troops.</p>
                        <pb n="24" xml:id="pg_24" facs="0062"/>
                        <p>15. I hope we can agree on something but I am not too sanguine.</p>
                        <p>16. The position of Turkey in this affair is a critical one. From my
                            talks in Ankara, I am persuaded that if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is enough of a fool to go to the Security
                            Council and try for a resolution designed to hamstring the Turks in
                            exercising their rights of intervention, without first dealing with the
                            internal situation through the organization of an international force,
                            he is likely to trigger an incisive Turkish reaction. The Turks may
                            move, and the Greeks will respond.</p>
                        <p>17. Our only hope, it seems to me, is to scare <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> sufficiently to compel him to
                            concentrate on the creation of an international force that will stop
                            carnage. If he does not do so—and I will know tomorrow—we have some hard
                            decisions to make. I have promised the Turks and Greeks to report on our
                            meetings here.</p>
                        <p>18. One possibility of preventing a Greco-Turkish war is to persuade both
                            governments to exercise the rights of unilateral intervention granted
                            them under the 1960 Treaties of Guarantee and move into Cyprus
                            peacefully and together in order to stop the destruction of the Greek
                            and Turkish communities. This obviously would not be feasible until
                            after the Greek elections which take place on Sunday.</p>
                        <p>19. For the moment, we have considerable influence with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, who has made clear to me his
                            gratitude for the US manifestations of interest in the Cyprus situation.
                            Hopefully we may be able to establish a relation of confidence with
                            whatever new government emerges from the Greek elections.</p>
                        <p>20. I have the impression that Britain, as the third guarantor power,
                            would be willing to associate itself with a peaceful joint intervention
                            by Greece and Turkey and would simultaneously increase present British
                            troop strength in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>21. To arrange a common action by Greece and Turkey would require
                            considerable diplomatic skill and the maximum use of our leverage. Yet I
                            am inclined tonight to think this may be about the only remaining hope
                            of preventing a major collision of two of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies—if, as I fear he will, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> turns out to be a prisoner or
                            a fool or both.</p>
                        <p>22. I am sending you this cable tonight not with the thought of immediate
                            instructions, since it is hard to make a definite plan until we know the
                            full results of tomorrow's meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. I must emphasize, however, that the atmosphere
                            at this end of the Mediterranean is supercharged and that an explosion
                            may be imminent. I shall try tomorrow to send you more considered
                            recommendations as to the options open to us and the immediate actions
                            we should take.</p>

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> reviewed the
                            situation in Cyprus. He pointed out that Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had seemed willing to see a
                            peace-keeping force composed not of troops from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> states (except for the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>), but from the Commonwealth and from nations like
                            Sweden. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> remarked that
                            the idea of such an alternative force was hopeful. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would see <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> again the morning of the
                            14th. Meanwhile, reports of heavy fighting in the southern part of the
                            island were disturbing, however, and Secretary Rusk stated that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> would proceed on the
                            14th to Ankara to counsel prudence to the Turkish government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> remarked that the
                            Cypriot government would surely bring the issue before the Security
                            Council and the Cypriot delegate, Rossides, would introduce a
                            resolution. If it were unreasonable, the British and the US could be
                            negative and would have the votes. If the resolution were reasonable and
                            two-sided, we could be reasonable about it.</p>
                        <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0064"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> remarked that the
                            best and most likely kind of resolution which would get a majority at
                            the Security Council was one of the “don't fight, talk” resolutions
                            which are customary in the Security Council under circumstances such as
                            now prevail in Cyprus. The US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            could back such a resolution in order to head off other ones of the sort
                            the Cypriot government would want. Namely, one to cast a shadow on the
                            Treaty of Guarantee.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DHSA1">Alec</persName> doubted that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> can control matters in Cyprus
                            any longer. He hoped that Canada would continue to be one of the states
                            making up the peace-keeping force.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> referred to the fact
                            that the Turks, Greeks and British have forces on the island by right;
                            this could be a concept which could be used to keep <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from calling in forces from
                            Egypt or the Soviet Bloc, for example, which have no right on the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DHSA1">Alec</persName> supposed that if the
                            Turkish army invaded Cyprus, the British government would call on it to
                            stop at a certain line. The British forces certainly would not fight a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ally.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that it would be important to have the Turkish
                            and Greek armies agree not to fight each other, should their governments
                            decide to send forces to occupy portions of Cyprus. It would also be
                            desirable that each side should protect the other's minority population.
                            He recalled that Queen Frederika of Greece had told him during her
                            recent visit to Washington that the Greek Army would move to Cyprus if
                            the Turkish Army did.<note n="2" xml:id="d12fn2"> Queen <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Frederika</persName> visited Washington on
                                January 27. Her comments on Cyprus were reported in a memorandum
                                from <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> to the President,
                                January 27. (<persName>Johnson</persName> Library National Security

                        </p>
                        <p>He then asked Sir Alec what motivates <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_DHSA1">Alec</persName> called <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> a stinker of the first water.
                            He wants a central government in Cyprus which would rob the Turkish
                            minority of its rights. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            seemed to rely on a Soviet promise that it will keep the Turks from
                            invading the island.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Harold Caccia</persName> stated that any
                            action of this sort by Russia against Turkey would bring <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> into action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> observed that this was a
                            matter of extreme danger. Before there would be a response to a Soviet
                            action affecting the Soviet-Turkish border the question would be in the
                            Security Council.</p>

                        <p>1031. For Read from Hainy. Following uncleared memo of conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. From Under
                            Secretary. Mr. Pickard and I called on the Archbishop this morning.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">Sir Cyril Pickard, Assistant Under Secretary
                                of State for the Commonwealth Relations Office, was Acting U.K. High
                                Commissioner for Cyprus. Pickard's report to his government on this
                                meeting was transmitted in telegram 748 from Nicosia, February 14.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I reiterated the concern of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for the situation in Cyprus not merely
                            because of the loss of life on the island but the threat to peace which
                            was posed. I expressed my disappointment that we had not been able to
                            arrive at an agreement on concrete measures but stated that my
                            government was not prepared to abandon efforts to contribute to an
                            alleviation of the dangers that threatened.</p>
                        <p>I said that I had been instructed to return to Washington today by way of
                            the capitals of Turkey and Greece. I would try to use what influence we
                            had to persuade the governments in Ankara and in Athens to exercise
                            restraint. Of course, the effectiveness of that would depend on the
                            absence of any incidents on the island. Before leaving I had been asked
                            to obtain the assurances of the Archbishop that he would make a public
                            declaration of the determination of his government to restore peace and
                            order and to take effective measures toward that end.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not intend to discuss further the question of the
                            application by the GOC to the Security Council but could only reiterate
                            my regret that they were pursuing this course before taking effective
                            steps to bring about an international force that could contribute toward
                            peace. I said also that the Archbishop and I had established, I thought,
                            a basis of personal friendship during the past three days and that I
                            felt it necessary to say to him that the debate in the Security Council
                            in the manner in which the issue was being presented by the GOC would
                            have a lamentable effect on the world's conception not merely of the
                            Government of Cyprus but of the leadership of the Archbishop.</p>
                        <p> Pickard then went on to say that he had also proposed to his government
                            that he should return to London via Ankara and Athens to discuss the
                            future of the British peace-keeping force on the island. He said that it
                            was impossible for the British forces to carry out their tasks in
                            present circumstances unless it was clear beyond all doubt that it was
                            the intention of the Government of Cyprus to restrain their forces and
                            avoid such attacks as have happened in Limassol.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0066"/>
                        <p>The Archbishop had previously given assurance that the government forces
                            would not retaliate even if attacked. In fact, however, an attack had
                            been carried out in Limassol with very little provocation from the
                            Turks. Peace could only be kept by the Cypriots themselves and no force
                            however it was composed could do the job keeping the peace unless it was
                            the intention of the Cypriots to find a peaceful basis of living
                            together.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop again reiterated his assurances about the peaceful
                            intentions of the Cypriot Government. He agreed, however, that the
                            present basis for peace-keeping was totally inadequate and that there
                            must be discussion of practical measures to restore the life of the
                            community on a normal basis. He undertook to proceed with such
                            discussions immediately on Pickard's return from London and to do his
                            utmost to establish a basis of confidence with the Turks which would
                            enable a return to normal conditions on the island.</p>
                        <p> Pickard stressed that this required compromise on the Greek side as well
                            as on the side of the Turks. There was no question of forcing the Turks
                            to comply with Greek requirements. What was required was an overall
                            negotiated agreement on practical measures for restoring life on the
                            island to normal. It was only on the basis of such a settlement that a
                            peace-keeping force would have any reality.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop accepted all this and undertook as a practical first step
                            himself to visit Limassol in order to give public expression to his
                            concern that the peace should be kept on both sides.</p>
                        <p>We left the meeting on the basis of a firm undertaking from the
                            Archbishop that he will get to work at once on practical ways of
                            reassuring and finding a basis for returning conditions to normality on
                            the island.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop also promised to make some form of public declaration
                            asserting his government's intention to keep the peace.</p>
                        <p>The Archbishop was undoubtedly sincere and on the face of it the proposal
                            of working out the details of practical measures for peacekeeping is a
                            sensible next step. It would, however, be a mistake to underestimate the
                            great difficulties of bringing any such discussions to a conclusion
                            acceptable to both sides.</p>
                        <p>I did not discuss the compromise plan at all with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and in view of Turkish and
                            British anxieties, I believe the less said regarding it the better for
                            the moment.</p>

                            Under Secretary said this exactly right course which can make major
                            contribution hold back Turks. Stated he had made clear to PriMin it
                            would disastrously prejudice chances defeating Cypriot <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> move if Turks took action giving credence
                            GOC claim Cyprus was in imminent danger Turk aggression, and that
                            request to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for release Turk <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> contingents on standby basis would be
                            exploited by GOC in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and make <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0068"/>efforts defeat GOC tactics
                            immensely more difficult. He had told PriMin emphatically US would never
                            support resolution questioning Treaty Guarantee and expressed confidence
                            that by working together we can defeat GOC ploy, and assured PriMin
                            closest consultation.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary asked if Turks could be told of plans for preemptive move
                            to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> on Saturday.</p>
                        <p>Secretary noted <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> and
                                <persName>Dean</persName> were with him and that Limassol casualties
                            not as great as first reported. Gave first reaction some of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> questions as follows:</p>
                        <p>See no prospect Russians would attempt intervene Cyprus but assume
                            Western powers including US would find way prevent. Noted other
                            possibility of Soviet pressure on Turkey in event Turkey moved
                            unilaterally under Treaty would raise gravest questions for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> generally and underscores necessity
                            finding answer Cyprus problem which would prevent that contingency.</p>
                        <p>Believe US and Turkey should act in closest harmony during period <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration and all parties, especially
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, should make maximum effort keep
                            situation calm.</p>
                        <p>Added that presumably British will shortly answer questions put to
                            British Ambassador since PriMin has returned London.</p>
                        <p>Re <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> tactics, Secretary stated we
                            contemplate British letter will go <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>

                        <p>Emphasized importance that Greeks not be informed of British letter

                        </p>
                        <p>Dear Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I have had a good talk with George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> about the impressions he gained on his trip and we
                            have given further thought to the explosive situation stemming from the
                            troubles in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reports he had a
                            particularly useful meeting with Rab <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Duncan
                                Sandys</persName> and I am glad to find that there is no difference
                            in our appraisals of the Cyprus crisis.<note n="2" xml:id="d15fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> reported on this meeting
                                in telegram 3969 from London, February 16. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I think you were wise to beat the Cypriots to the Security Council.<note n="3" xml:id="d15fn3">On February 15, following <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' formal rejection of the
                                U.S.-U.K. proposals for an international military force, the British
                                Government requested a Security Council meeting to discuss Cyprus.
                                See <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1964,</hi> pp. 561–562.</note> It seems very likely that we
                            should be able to prevent the use of the Council to scrap the guarantee
                            treaty. I hope we can also obtain a satisfactory resolution for the
                            creation of an international force. However, the Council may well be
                            heading into a mean and protracted debate, and I fear that an
                            international force will not be landed in Cyprus quickly.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, there is the increasing nervousness of the Turks. In more than
                            three hours of conversation with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> came away convinced, as you know, that the Turks
                            are poised to intervene and that they will certainly move if a further
                            nasty incident like Limassol should occur. In that event, we would be in
                            for deep trouble since the Greeks have made it clear that they will not
                            stand down.</p>
                        <p>I conclude from all this that we cannot safely depend merely on the
                            results of the Security Council action. Even an international force may
                            not secure order in Cyprus. As your own people on the Island have
                            pointed out quite perceptively no peacekeeping force will be able to
                            maintain order unless something can be done to change the attitude of
                            the two communities—and the encouragement each is getting from the
                            mainland. Yet Turkish passions will not subside, even with a force in
                            being, if the killing continues.</p>
                        <p>For that reason, I would strongly urge you to give serious thought to
                            convening the guarantor powers under Article IV of the Treaty for a
                            summit <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0070"/>conference within the next
                            few days. There are clear advantages in acting promptly. First, we need
                            immediate insurance against a unilateral Turkish move. Second, we have,
                            at long last, a Greek Government with a solid majority. Papandreou is
                            rumored in the press this morning as possibly intending to get together
                            with the Turks as his first order of business. This may well be the
                            psychological moment for an effort to break the impasse.</p>
                        <p>I should think that the subject matter of such a summit meeting could
                            well be the security problem in Cyprus and support for the international
                            force in the United Nations. At the same time, I think you might use
                            such a meeting to develop standby contingency arrangements against the
                            possibility that the Turks may be stimulated by events into a unilateral
                            move.</p>
                        <p>Such arrangements could take the form of a pledge from each of the
                            guarantor powers that, if one party felt compelled to move, it would
                            confer with the other two powers to make arrangements by which the move
                            would be made on a tripartite basis. Military representatives of the
                            three countries could work out plans for some kind of a combined
                            operation—perhaps along the lines suggested in a paper which George
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> gave to Rab <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> and Duncan Sandys in

                        </p>
                        <p>If such a meeting were to be held, it might be useful to ask the United
                            States to send observers in order that we could add our influence to
                            yours in injecting some rationality into the present situation. If you
                            thought this a good idea, I would be glad to send George <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and perhaps General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Maxwell Taylor</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Of course, it is important that whatever the guarantor powers do as a
                            group should reinforce rather than cut across the current effort in New
                            York to establish the basis for an international peacekeeping force.
                            Both the draft resolution you expect to put into the Security Council
                            and the ideas floated by U Thant include the provision that the
                            guarantor powers should reach agreement, along with the Government of
                            Cyprus, on details of a peacekeeping plan. I have no doubt that a
                            meeting of guarantor powers could be fitted into the track now being
                            pursued in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>With my strong feeling that time is of the essence, I am at your disposal
                            to help in any possible way to avoid the fearful consequences of a

                        <p>I have sent you separately my congratulations on your landslide victory

                                February 19, the Embassy commented that the main characteristic of
                                the new Papandreou government was its “moderate nature,” noting that
                                Papandreou had placed conservatives in key positions. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 15–1 GREECE)</note> We are particularly
                            happy that a government can now be formed soonest with a clear majority,
                            because of the grave crisis which confronts the Western Alliance over
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Truly, this is a time which requires the closest collaboration of all the
                            allies concerned if we are to surmount the crisis. The US, because of
                            its deep commitment to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            alliance, will do whatever it can to help. Nor are we pressing for any
                            specific long-range solution. On the contrary, as we have repeatedly
                            sought to make clear, the United States has no position on terms of any
                            final settlement. What we all need immediately is the reestablishment of
                            law and order so that the parties can proceed to the search for
                            solutions acceptable to all.</p>
                        <p>And let me assure you that we are neither favoring Turkey at the expense
                            of Greece nor vice versa. Our interest is—as it has been since 1947—that
                            of supporting the security and well-being of two close <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. As we see it, the common need
                            of Greece, Turkey, the US, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to
                            stick together is paramount.</p>
                        <p>It will take the highest statesmanship on all sides, but especially in
                            Athens and Ankara, to prevent a wholly unnecessary debacle—and one which
                            threatens the very security of both Greece and Turkey—from being
                            precipitated by the Cypriot extremists of both sides.</p>
                        <p>For this reason I am grateful that you won by a majority that gives you
                            the necessary freedom of action, because we count heavily on the wise
                            heads of you and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> to help
                            find some way of stopping the drift toward communal tragedy. I have seen
                            with interest reports that you may have been considering a new effort in
                            partnership with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, and while
                            I do not know the details of what you may have in mind, I do want to say
                            that in principle nothing could be more helpful than joint action by <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0072"/>the leaders of Greece and Turkey
                            in the spirit which I am sure you have in mind.</p>
                        <p>In this critical period it is important that our representatives keep in
                            close touch with each other, in Nicosia and New York as well as Athens
                            and Washington. We recognize the special responsibilities which Greece,
                            Turkey, and the United Kingdom must continue to bear, but you may count
                            on us as well.<note n="3" xml:id="d16fn3">In a February 27 response,

                        <p>1272. Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>1. I called on PriMin last night. I found him looking tired but mentally
                            alert. After I extended our congratulations on his great political
                            victory, we immediately got down to discussion Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>2. I recalled to him that our only interest was reestablishment law and
                            order so that parties concerned could work out political solution in
                            atmosphere of calm. For our part, we had no pre-conceived ideas of what
                            ultimate solution should be—this was matter for parties concerned.
                            Papandreou indicated he understood and appreciated our position, but
                            said that many considered we were supporting Turks. He smilingly added
                            that if the US fully supported the “right”, we would have to take
                            sides—Greece's—for London-Zurich Accords had created impossible <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0073"/>situation. I suggested one of
                            reasons for public misunderstanding was irresponsible and wholly
                            misleading articles in Greek press which led the public to believe that
                            US either had ulterior motives or was supporting Turkey versus Greece. I
                            pointed out that Paraskevopoulos caretaker govt had either been
                            unwilling or unable tell facts to public.</p>
                        <p>3. While on the subject of our support of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> position, I said that it was obvious we could not
                            accept the view—apparently advanced by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>—that the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            could amend or nullify treaties. This could only be accomplished through
                            negotiation of the interested parties. Papandreou nodded assent. I
                            stressed that, even though we took above position on treaty, we had been
                            using very strong pressure on <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> not to
                            exercise “right of intervention.”</p>
                        <p>4. I then went on to say that, during these past days, the situation on
                            the island had deteriorated and was extremely dangerous. Not only was
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> apparently acting
                            on very bad advice, but individual guerrilla bands were growing in
                            strength and independence. Consequently it was of transcending
                            importance that peacekeeping force be organized and despatched quickly
                            and, meanwhile, that every effort be made to prevent further violence on
                            the island. In view great danger confronting us all, I added that it was
                            indeed fortunate that Papandreou had achieved his overwhelming electoral
                            victory, for this put him in key position to play constructive and
                            decisive role on Cyprus question; his election could well prove turning
                            point in history as he was probably only man who could move problem
                            toward solution.</p>
                        <p>5. After we agreed on need for peace force and also on fact this only
                            temporary expedient, I said it seemed to me only hope for any solution,
                            long or short term, was agreement between Greece and Turkey—certainly no
                            permanent solution could be found without their agreement. Meanwhile,
                            what could Papandreou do to get <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in hand and also control Greek-Cypriot
                            irregular leaders? This was essential and extremely urgent.</p>
                        <p>6. Papandreou said first that he already moved to gain control over Greek
                            Cypriots as he had told me he would do if elected. He repeated his
                            statement to me of last week (Embtel 1205)<note n="2" xml:id="d17fn2">Dated February 11. (Ibid.)</note> that it was inadmissible for
                            Greece's future to be decided by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and stated firmly that he intended to enforce
                            discipline on Greek Cypriots. To achieve this, he had been in touch with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and had also just
                            that afternoon met with General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and a “representative” of Cypriot Interior
                            Minister Georgatzis; he expected Georgatzis to arrive during the night.
                            He also said he was contacting <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sampson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LV1">Lyssarides</persName> and the Commander of the Greek forces in
                            Cyprus, Col. Petridies. He said he would demand that Greek <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0074"/>Cypriots undertake no violence against
                            Turk Cypriots unless attacked first. He stressed importance <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> holding Turk Cypriots in check.
                            Otherwise, he seemed confident that he could exert the necessary control
                            over the Greek Cypriots to create an atmosphere leading to
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>7. The PriMin agreed completely that first step was to bring about peace
                            and calm atmosphere in which negotiations could take place. However, he
                            said long-term solution requires removal of Greek and Turkish forces
                            from Cyprus; their presence there, facing one another was unnatural and
                            created constant tension. Their place should be taken by an
                            international force, he continued, that would stay as long as needed.
                            Long term solution would require “international” guarantee rather than
                            present impossible system. He did not spell out “international” but
                            seemed to have in mind a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee of
                            some sort (I don't think he would rule out <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>) which would give “complete” guarantees to Turk
                            Cypriots for protection of their minority rights (he repeated word
                            “complete” several times).</p>
                        <p>8. Papandreou said he thought time had come when <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> could play constructive role in
                            Cyprus; he observed that as <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' prestige was going down, <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>' was going up. However, he
                            emphasized that he did not want to play one off against the other, and
                            that it was essential that they cooperate or the Communists would gain.
                            He apparently had not thought through how <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>' appearance on scene would affect British or
                            Turks. He seemed to be toying with idea that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> would pull all irregular
                            elements together and ensure discipline, leaving <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as President—for the moment
                            at least. This is all in “feeling out” stage and I doubt that Papandreou
                            sees clear path ahead as yet.</p>
                        <p>9. I stressed again that it was vital that there be understanding between
                            Greece and Turkey. He agreed and said that if he were to meet <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, he would tell him that it is
                            insane to consider war between Greece and Turkey; however, he added that
                            if Turks “open door to insane asylum, then he would have to accompany
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> inside.” I did not press
                            him on meeting with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, since I
                            thought it would be counter-productive to do so at that particular
                            moment. However, I have very definite impression he would go along with
                            meeting if we can set proper stage. President's letter to Brit PriMin
                            may show the way, but this should be researched by Brits.</p>
                        <p>10. Papandreou expressed optimism about outcome of talks at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; he said info he had received during
                            afternoon sounded promising. He strongly favors giving U Thant proposals
                            a good try.</p>
                        <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I was impressed by speed with which
                            Papandreou has started action aimed at gaining control of Greek Cypriots
                            as he had told me he would in our meeting last week. He seemed fully
                            cognizant of dangers involved in Cyprus crisis and said several times he
                            wanted to move Cyprus from the “danger” status to the “problem” status.
                            Whether <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0075"/>he can really gain
                            control of Greeks on island remains to be seen, but he apparently is
                            confident that he can and is going to make real college try. Meanwhile,
                            I urge that we restate to Turks importance controlling their brethren on
                            island in order prevent incidents such as those mentioned in Nicosia's

                        <p>Dept gratified at constructive dialogue which you have conducted with
                            Papandreou since election. We are anxious have you continue full and
                            frank exchange with him on all aspects of Cyprus problem both to
                            establish mutual confidence and to create positive atmosphere for
                            eventual Greco-Turkish (or tripartite) meeting. This connection, we wish
                            give him our appraisal of current situation in New York, as follows:</p>
                        <p>As we read situation at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, there has been
                            substantial agreement among all concerned on same basic elements
                            accepted in earlier US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> proposal, to
                            wit, need for international peacekeeping force and need for mediator.
                            However, in our judgment, prospects are extremely remote that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> session will result in any kind of action
                            giving reality to either of these two concepts. Reason for this
                            perfectly clear: <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            remains <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0076"/>obdurate in opposing any
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution which does not have
                            effect of negating Treaty of Guarantee. He presumably has Soviet veto in
                            his pocket and we assume will not hesitate to use it. We and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, on the other hand, are equally
                            determined that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> shall not be exploited
                            to nullify Treaty of Guarantee, and most members of Council agree this
                            should not be the case. We are not seeking get <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> reaffirm Treaty of Guarantee; however, we cannot agree
                            to type of resolution sought by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> which by completely ignoring Treaty and by
                            giving an international force mandate that appears to be directed
                            against Turkish intervention has effect of negating Treaty.</p>
                        <p>We hope <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is under no illusion about
                            futility of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' efforts
                            get kind of action from Council he wants. (We assume Bitsios has so
                            reported to Athens.) Only way we can see to prevent total impasse at
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> relents in his position. We hope <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> doing what it can get him adopt more
                            flexible attitude toward <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution.
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> President <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> (Brazil) is now consulting
                            with non-permanent <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> members in hope of
                            working out a formula which both sides can accept. We wish them well in
                            this endeavor, but looking at problem realistically, we are convinced
                            Bernardes will fare no better than U Thant has unless <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> prepared abandon his
                            objective of getting <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to vitiate
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Our present assessment is that efforts to get an acceptable resolution in
                            Council may run for another two or three days. But we deeply concerned
                            that if <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> produces nothing, as we
                            anticipate, vacuum may be created in which there will be further
                            violence in Cyprus and renewed temptation for Turks to move in. We would
                            be interested in any thoughts Papandreou has on possible lines of
                            approach to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. We glad he
                            planned to see Turkish Ambassador and would be interested to learn
                            whether he did so and what came of meeting. If US, as friend of both
                            sides, can in any way facilitate Greek-Turkish dialogue, we shall be
                            most happy to do so.</p>
                        <p>With future course of events in Cyprus murky in face of almost certain
                            Council inaction, we would warmly welcome any thoughts Papandreou has on
                            steps that might be taken now to avoid a dangerous vacuum when deadlock
                            reached in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p> FYI: We think an early Papandreou-<persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> meeting would be best next step. This could be
                            without prejudice to later participation of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (and US) if this proves desirable. We believe such
                            meeting could provide vehicle for keeping lid on situation in Cyprus and
                            convincing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept
                            international peacekeeping force along lines of <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> Plan.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">This plan, which was rejected, proposed establishment of an
                                international peacekeeping force and provided for a mediator under

                                1964.</note> Possible outcome of such meeting could be to: (a)
                            address an appeal to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to
                            take all possible measures to maintain law and order; (b) <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0077"/>urge him to accept international force
                            along lines of Thant Plan; and (c) reassure <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, as in Allied Plan, that rights of intervention
                            under Treaty of Guarantee would be suspended for period during which
                            international force operating and while mutually-agreed mediator was
                            seeking political solution. We also believe that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' willingness accept
                            international peacekeeping force along lines of Thant Plan would be
                            decisively influenced if the Greeks and Turks could make clear to him
                            that alternative to such an international peacekeeping force would be
                            tripartite military intervention under Treaty of Guarantee. Confronted
                            with choice between international force along lines of <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> Plan and tripartite military

                            context of an exchange of views on where we are in New York, and to have

                                a memorandum of their conversation is ibid.</note> of your plan to
                            approach the Greek and Turkish Governments tomorrow to urge a meeting
                            between Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. I
                            told him that we would ask our Ambassadors in the two capitals to
                            coordinate with yours in order to give whatever reinforcement seemed
                            useful.</p>
                        <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0078"/>
                        <p>While I see great virtue in a bilateral meeting, I am not at all sanguine
                            it can be achieved at this point. Our own tentative soundings have
                            indicated that it will be difficult for either Papandreou or <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> to move without at least some
                            third party invitation and a juridical excuse for conferring.</p>
                        <p>I would strongly urge, therefore, that if the answer is negative—as I
                            fear it will be—you consider going back promptly with a request for
                            tripartite consultation under Article 4 of the Treaty of Guaranty. As I
                            read this Article, consultation is not merely a privilege, but an
                            obligation of the parties—if there is reason to believe that the state
                            of affairs under the constitution has been altered. In order to bring
                            the Greeks along it might well be necessary to suggest that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Kutchuck be invited to
                            participate in the consultation.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, we might propose to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that the Turks themselves extend the invitation
                            for tripartite consultation. This would have, however, two
                            disadvantages. First, based on my conversations with <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>, I doubt that the Turks would be
                            prepared to call for a tripartite consultation unless it were clearly
                            understood that this was a prelude to tripartite intervention. Second,
                            the Greeks might be less responsive to a Turkish request for
                            consultation than to an invitation from your Government.</p>
                        <p>I feel more than ever that some move of this kind is imperative. It seems
                            evident that the Greek Cypriot game is to try to keep the United Nations
                            proceedings going. This is a forum where they can draw support from
                            their Communist friends. It provides them with insulation against a
                            Turkish move while eroding Turkish intervention rights.</p>
                        <p>Bernardes, the President of the Security Council, is trying to work out a
                            compromise resolution before Thursday afternoon. If the Cypriots
                            continue to dig in, however, I think it may become apparent by then that
                            no resolution can be forthcoming. The Cypriots are exploiting to the
                            maximum Soviet and Czech support. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> has played the Council skillfully, and there
                            is developing evidence of softness on the part of the Ivory Coast and
                            Morocco. The increasing pro-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> line being pursued by Bitsios is having its
                            effect on the Council members.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, in Cyprus <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is
                            moving with his characteristic Byzantine deviousness. The regularizing
                            of 5,000 irregulars looks to us as an effort to lay a basis for a
                            request that your troops be withdrawn. There is plenty of evidence that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> does not want a
                            peace-keeping force of any kind. By asking the withdrawal of British
                            forces, he would probably discourage countries from contributing
                            components even if the Security Council should produce a satisfactory
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> can keep the matter
                            going in New York, he probably feels that he can deal with the Turkish
                            Cypriots without much fear of Turkish intervention—particularly with his
                            exaggerated belief in the nature of Soviet assistance.</p>
                        <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0079"/>
                        <p>Against this background, we see his call for the disarmament of the
                            population as laying the basis for a move to disarm the Turkish
                            Cypriots. In this connection we have good report that Papadoupulos made
                            speech on the 24th to the Patriotic Front Deputies saying GOC has
                            decided definitely to rely fully on Soviet support having lost hope in
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>All these events in Nicosia have certainly not been lost on Ankara, which
                            is presumably feeling an increasing claustrophobia. I do not think we
                            can count on <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> holding the
                            line, once it becomes clear that an international force is not on. And,
                            if the Turks sense the erosion of their treaty rights to intervene, they
                            may feel compelled to move before it is too late.</p>
                        <p>All of these considerations seem to me to urge a tripartite meeting if
                            Bernardes is not successful and if we cannot secure the promise of an
                            immediate bilateral Greek-Turkish dialogue. Such a meeting would seem to
                            offer several opportunities:</p>
                        <p>(a) To convince <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that the
                            Turks mean business and that he is playing too risky a game;</p>
                        <p>(b) To press <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept
                            and support an international peace-keeping force along the lines of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> plan; and</p>
                        <p>(c) To undertake contingency planning for a possible tripartite
                            intervention as an alternative to unilateral Turkish move.</p>
                        <p>I do not think I am being alarmist in feeling a deep sense of urgency. I
                            cannot believe that the arms build-up in Cyprus can continue much longer
                            without grave danger of an explosion.</p>
                        <p>I think it very likely that if the Security Council fades out and the
                            Cypriots prove unable to secure an emergency General Assembly meeting
                            the present superficial calm will give way to a bloodbath. <hi rend="italic">End verbatim text.</hi><note n="3" xml:id="d19fn3">In telegram 4189 from London, February 27,

                        <p>1302. 1. I think we have reached a stage which warrants reevaluation of
                            some aspects of our policy and tactics dealing with the Cyprus question.
                            Our main concern has been to prevent a situation from developing which
                            would embroil two of our allies, thus precipitating <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> disaster. To this end, our basic
                            drive thus far has been to gain time and keep the Turks from making a
                            military move on Cyprus which the Greeks would inevitably feel bound to
                            counter. We have consequently worked for measures which would
                            effectively suppress violence on the island and thus deprive the Turks
                            of the provocation which might trigger off a legally justified
                            intervention on their part. In order to avoid antagonizing either of
                            these two allies of the US, we have studiously avoided taking a position
                            as to the form or the shape of a final settlement of the Cyprus problem.
                            We have said many times that the solution is a matter for the parties
                            concerned. This was probably the proper stand for us to take at first,
                            but is it right and is it good enough to meet the situation which faces
                            us today?</p>
                        <p>2. It must no doubt be difficult for the more sophisticated to believe
                            that the US has been willing to accept an important role in the efforts
                            to bring peace to the island without also attempting to form a
                            considered judgment as to how the matter ought to be settled on a
                            long-term basis. In our conversations, PriMin Papandreou has been
                            probing for a US position and obviously does not believe that we do not
                            have one. In fact (as has become increasingly clear during <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate) our studious avoidance to take a
                            position is in itself a position—one that is inevitably interpreted as
                            favoring the existing set of arrangements rather than acknowledging the
                            pace of events and the impetus to change the agreements which have been
                            established and theoretically govern Cyprus. Moreover, while continuing
                            to adhere to this noncommittal attitude of neutrality on the question of
                            a long-term solution, we have been supporting—in effect if not in
                            words—the Turkish insistence that the Treaty of Guarantee affords the
                            Turks a legal cover for intervention. We are thus inevitably taken to be
                            supporting not only the Treaty of Guarantee but the other aspects of the
                            London and Zurich Agreements as well—in short, the status quo.</p>
                        <p>3. It has already been vividly and painfully demonstrated that the
                            present arrangements for Cyprus do not work and will in due course <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0081"/>have to be changed. In Cyprus, in
                            Greece, and at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, the pressure for
                            “self-determination” is increasingly strong. I do not see how the US can
                            ultimately escape agreeing to the application of more self-determination
                            for Cyprus than is presently permitted in the existing arrangements
                            without laying itself open to the charge of moral inconsistency. Only
                            last Saturday the communiqué issued after President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s meeting with Pres. Lopez
                            Mateos reaffirmed “support of the principle of self-determination of all
                            peoples and of its corollary, non-intervention. They agreed … to promote
                            the acceptance of such principles, not only with words but with deeds,
                            in the Americas and throughout the world.”<note n="2" xml:id="d20fn2">For full text of the statement, see <hi rend="italic">Public Papers

                        <p>4. Much more will be heard in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> halls and
                            out, from the Soviet and Afro-Asian blocs, and indeed from the Greeks,
                            on the necessity for applying the principle of self-determination to
                            Cyprus. Will it not then become increasingly embarrassing for us to
                            avoid taking stand? In the end our strategy of neutrality (generally
                            interpreted as support of the existing arrangements) will not only hurt
                            us in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but spread the wrong
                            impression about US policy around the world. Here in Greece, adherence
                            to this strategy over a long period of time, with the resulting vocal
                            reactions in the press, among the public and in government circles, may
                            do serious and lasting damage to US-Greek relations that will have
                            repercussions more far-reaching than Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>5. Since it seems to me that we will inevitably be driven to conceding in
                            the end that the present arrangements cannot be made to work, would it
                            not be well to make a virtue of necessity by saying at once that, in our
                            opinion, the agreements will, in due course, have to be altered by
                            negotiations between the interested parties? I believe that this would
                            clear the air considerably, put us in a less uncomfortable position to
                            deal with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, the Greeks
                            and the neutral and Soviet blocs—thus improving the chances for the
                            creation of a peace force—and give some negotiating substance to future
                            discussions between Greeks and Turks. While, in the recent past, the
                            cruelty of the Greek Cypriot irregulars toward the Turkish minority and
                            the deviousness of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> have
                            damaged the majority's case for control by it of the island's affairs,
                            the fact remains that the Greek Cypriot 82 percent majority has the
                            right to a preponderant voice in determining what the island's
                            government and policies ought to be.</p>
                        <p>6. Obviously, the Turks will hardly welcome this evolution in our
                            position. We can, I believe, relieve some if not all of their concern by
                            emphasizing that our position in favor of modifying the agreements is
                            rigidly conditioned on complete protection of the rights of the Turkish
                            Cypriot minority—rights which, however, cannot include a veto over <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0082"/>the 82 percent majority's right
                            to control its foreign affairs, defense and taxes. This guarantee of the
                            rights of the minority would, in the first stage, have to be insured by
                            the presence and appropriate authority of an international force. Such a
                            force would have to stay on the island long enough to make sure, for the
                            future, that the Government of Cyprus would not and could not use the
                            principle of self-determination as a means of destroying or oppressing
                            the Turkish minority.</p>
                        <p>7. While the course of action proposed may not curb overnight the
                            neutralist and leftward drift of the island's present government, I
                            believe that it would somewhat restore the position of the West in
                            Cyprus and make the island a less open target for Communist intrigue and
                            penetration. It would make it easier for the US to maneuver amidst
                            changing events. Our first step ought to be an acknowledgement that the
                            present arrangements have less chance than ever to become workable in
                            practice. (The setting up of the London conference and the subsequent
                            Anglo-American suggestions for appointing a mediator implied, in a
                            sense, that changes were needed.) Our main goal should continue to be
                            the elimination of communal strife through the dispatch of an
                            international force or in any other way that might appear practicable.
                            Looking further ahead, it may be that, in the end a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> guarantee or some other form of
                            association of the island with the West will become desirable and
                            feasible—for a Cyprus remaining a permanent apple of discord between
                            Greeks and Turks would continue to be a grave threat to Western and US
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>8. The foregoing observations and recommendations have been set down in
                            full awareness that</p>
                        <p>(a) A shift in our public position in the direction of self-determination
                            will be taken as a victory for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> (who bears such heavy responsibility for the
                            present impasse), and</p>
                        <p>(b) That if the Turkish minority were to continue to be permitted to
                            retain a degree of control over the island's affairs out of proportion
                            to its voting strength, it might help frustrate neutralist and leftist
                            tendencies on the island. (The Greeks, of course, argue forcefully that
                            continuation of present situation is driving Cyprus into Communist
                            arms.)</p>
                        <p>Although these considerations are important and must be weighed, I firmly
                            believe that the United States stands to lose less by modifying our
                            position along lines suggested.<note n="3" xml:id="d20fn3">Telegram 880

                            peaceful settlement, remarking that most people would rather talk things
                            out than fight. He expressed regret there had been misunderstanding of
                            U.S. attitude. Sent his regards and best wishes to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As in prior talk with Secretary, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> emphasized need for unitary state in Cyprus
                            “with everyone equal” and understanding that Greece and Turkey should
                            have nothing to do with Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>President commented that unfortunately neither Greek Cypriots nor Turkish
                            Cypriots seemed to think this way. Greek Cypriots thought of themselves
                            as Greek just as much as Turkish Cypriots thought of themselves as
                            Turkish. Feelings ran high on both sides not only on island but in
                            Greece and Turkey as well. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stuck to his position.</p>
                        <p>Conversation was amicable throughout.</p>

                        <p>2377. There are number important points which we believe need to be
                            pursued re establishment and operation of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force in Cyprus:</p>
                        <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>1) Three month period for which force established is absolute minimum
                            within which we can reasonably expect mediator to make any headway
                            toward permanent settlement. It therefore desirable that date at which
                            writ for force starts to run not begin prematurely. We note that
                            Cypriots themselves consider logical date for three-month period to
                            begin is date of placement of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops
                            in Cyprus rather than date res adopted. We hope Thant will bear this in
                            mind by formally designating establishment of force only when he has
                            sizable contingents (2,000 to 3,000 non-<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> troops) on the ground. If <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> has not yet turned over British units to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> control, as London's 4357<note n="2" xml:id="d23fn2">Dated March 6. (Ibid.)</note> would indicate, this
                            should give U Thant additional time to maneuver on effective date on
                            which <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force becomes operative.</p>
                        <p>2) Septel deals with question size <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            contribution to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3">In telegram 5722 to London, March 9, the Department
                                expressed concern about the size of the proposed British troop
                                contribution to the peacekeeping force. (Ibid.)</note> In
                            discussions with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_BR1">Bunche</persName>, you authorized draw on this
                            message to indicate our views on this subject.</p>
                        <p>3) We understand Sweden insists it not be only neutral country and hope
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> continuing press Irish and Finns
                            to contribute at least some troops. (We understand Brazil will probably
                            not contribute troops because of domestic considerations, and in view of
                            their extraordinarily high per diem requirements would not be disposed
                            to push them to participate.)</p>
                        <p>4) We concerned that as things are now going <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> will not be able muster minimum force of 10,000 men
                            unless <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> keeps all its present forces in
                            Cyprus and we assume they will be most reluctant if not totally
                            unwilling to do so. We find it difficult believe that Cypriots would not
                            accept Danish contingent if they can accept <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Canada. Since Danes apparently willing and eager
                            serve, we think <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> should at least urge
                            Cypriots reconsider question Danish participation.</p>
                        <p>5) Major problem which will confront force once it established is precise
                            terms of engagement under which it will operate. We note that Canadians,
                            Swedes, and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> concerned on this score.
                            It is unrealistic to expect that countries will put their troops into
                            field under <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s command until they
                            know more clearly than they are told in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res what ground rules are under which troops will be
                            used.</p>
                        <p>One of most difficult questions likely to be what <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force should do re armed irregulars and Greek Cypriot
                            police. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will
                            undoubtedly try use <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force to help
                            disarm Turkish Cypriots. Any such move, of course, would be totally
                            unacceptable in Ankara. Since dispute in case is between two communities
                            in Cyprus, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would need to operate in
                            even-handed fashion and can hardly lend itself to disarming one party to
                                <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0086"/>dispute while leaving other
                            in control of security force. Alternatively, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> might try use his augmented
                            police force to disarm Turkish Cypriots while <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force is on the ground, assuming latter will restrain
                            Turks from invading Cyprus. This would pose much more difficult problem
                            since <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would argue this
                            is exercise of sovereign powers of GOC. In fact, of course, Constitution
                            gives Turkish Cypriots veto power in field of security, and use of
                            police force clearly falls within this provision. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could refuse permit disarming of Turk Cypriots by police
                            since this would inevitably lead to violence between communities and
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res calls on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force to prevent recurrence fighting.</p>
                        <p>6) With a mandate of only 3 months and resolution directing force “to use
                            its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and as necessary
                            contribute to maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return
                            to normal conditions”, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s role would be
                            that of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> policeman. That is, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force should interpose itself between two
                            communities preventing hostilities, arranging cease-fires and taking any
                            other steps it finds necessary to maintain law and order. This will
                            involve certain amount initiative on part of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force and necessitate practical cooperation from both
                            communities.</p>
                        <p>7) We assume that—unlike Congo where use of force authorized in certain
                            specified circumstances—<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force in
                            Cyprus would use force only in self-defense.</p>
                        <p>8) There may also be danger that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will seek to exploit the phrase “return to
                            normal conditions” as meaning that Turkish Cypriots will have to be
                            moved back to domiciles where they were located before current fighting
                            began; he may argue that de facto partition has been created and must be
                            abolished if “normal conditions” are to prevail. We assume <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not lend itself to any effort at
                            forced population movement. Turk Cypriots deserted mixed villages in
                            fear for their lives and would resist any attempt send them back. For
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to do anything to abet such effort
                            would be widely regarded as pro-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> move.</p>
                        <p>Request <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> discuss foregoing questions
                            as appropriate with U Thant, <persName corresp="#p_BR1">Bunche</persName> and Rikhye, urging that they clarify <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> policy as soon as possible so that
                            potential contributors will know what to expect re utilization their
                            forces.</p>

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had always assumed that Turkish

                            restraint and then accepting resolution, only to find itself in steadily
                            deteriorating situation.</p>
                        <p>8. Throughout crisis <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> has been
                            very patient but this morning he said for first time that situation
                            approaching point where Turkey would be forced intervene unless
                            effective measures taken to bring it under control, and asked <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> so advise me.</p>
                        <p>I spent some time trying reassure <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> and at same time ferret out what had happened
                            since we talked on Saturday to generate so much heat. Among other things
                            I stressed danger of becoming overly exercised re reports from Cyprus
                            which had been notoriously inaccurate in past; observed that BBC and

                            having been helpful in effecting a cease-fire in Paphos area; said I

                            resolution and would be stretching things pretty far for GOC to attempt

                            less tense but there was certain note of finality on which conversation
                            closed that was disturbing. I hope I am not imagining things but
                            impression <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> seemed to be
                            trying convey was that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had gone long
                            way with us but was now finding situation very hard to bear and might
                            have to strike out on own unless present trend reversed both in New York
                            and in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>British Amb Allen immediately followed me and we compared notes
                            afterward. Apparently conversation covered same points including message
                            from <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, and, although
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> had begun on lower key,
                            he had ended on bitter note that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> now
                            in backwash of resolution it should not have approved and at loss defend
                            itself before Turkish people and Parliament. (Fact that High Military
                            Council opened semi-annual meeting here this morning and had Cyprus as
                            first item on agenda may have been another contributing factor.)</p>
                        <p> Allen and I carefully checked our memories on <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> message concerning possible intervention and
                            agreed it did not reflect indication of intention to intervene but
                            rather that intervention could become necessary unless something done to
                            avert present deterioration in New York and Cyprus and that it was
                            especially up to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US to see that

                        <p>Comment: It is possible that conversation which Barnes happened have

                                Barnes' talk with Bayramoglu was reported in telegram 1134.</note>
                            may cast some light on what troubling Turks, at least as far as we
                            concerned. After expressing similar unhappiness re resolution and other
                            developments, Bayramoglu wondered whether we still as interested in
                            Cyprus as before or whether now that resolution was passed, we would not
                            be inclined pull out. If, as possible, this may be doubt which <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> hesitated mention, it could
                            partially explain vigor of his approach, i.e., to try to keep us
                            interested while at same time seeking goad British to bear down harder
                            until peace force arrives.</p>
                        <p>In sum, this may not be crisis but no doubt that we have some very
                            restive Turks on our hands and that it would be helpful if we could do

                            even if they had to stage through some Near Eastern base or British

                            several lines simultaneously. Rapid formulation of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force was one route being vigorously
                            pursued. But seemed to us moment had now come for calling of summit
                            conference under Treaty of Guarantee, Greece, Turkey, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> (and possibly <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName>) previously agreed with <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> to be useful fall-back at some stage of

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GD1">Greenhill</persName> said as we knew London
                            had been thinking along same lines. He asked where we thought conference
                            should be held. Under Secretary said he remembered British suggestion
                            was to hold it in Geneva. Under Secretary and <persName corresp="#p_GD1">Greenhill</persName> agreed <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> would need to be invited, and <persName corresp="#p_GD1">Greenhill</persName> mentioned also representative

                            in Athens for funeral. British said their understanding was Archbishop
                            intended stay in Athens until Friday but British had offered fly him
                            back to Nicosia via RAF whenever he wished. <persName corresp="#p_GD1">Greenhill</persName>, as own idea, suggested <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> might go to Nicosia to help calm things
                            down. US reaction to this idea was inconclusive. Under Secretary said
                            regardless of what was done, summit meeting nevertheless was not in
                            conflict with any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> moves at this

                        <p>The President has decided that the U.S. will provide troop airlift free

                        <p>1015. During discussion this morning, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> reviewed recent political and military
                            developments. Makarios thought that peak of crisis had passed, that
                            worst difficulties were behind him and that, although further troubles
                            could be expected, situation would improve from now on. Discussion of
                            political and military situation revolved around three aspects:</p>
                        <p>1. Creation and establishment of <gloss target="#t_PKF1">PKF</gloss> in
                            Cyprus: <gloss target="#t_PKF1">PKF</gloss> was now settled. It would
                            become clear during next two weeks whether it would be successful or
                            not. <gloss target="#t_PKF1">PKF</gloss> cooperation with GOC and nature
                            of its terms of reference were essential to success.</p>
                        <p>2. Mediator: <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said name
                            of <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Sakari Severi Tuomioja</persName> had
                            been suggested. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> was
                            agreeable to GOC, Greece and Britain.<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">Secretary-General Thant announced <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s appointment on March 25. For text of the
                                statement, see U.N. Doc. S/5625 and Corr. 1.</note> He had not yet
                            heard whether he was acceptable to Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said he was “pessimistic mediation would soon
                            result in political settlement.” It depended on whether Turkish Cypriots
                            would be willing to return to their villages and not insist on some form
                            of partition or federation. Success or failure of Mediator would begin
                            to emerge within one month.</p>
                        <p>3. Return of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to their homes and jobs: Some
                            estimates were that there were now 6,000 displaced Greek Cypriots and
                            45,000 or 50,000 Turkish Cypriots and it was estimated former would
                            increase to 20,000 and latter to 80,000 within next month or so.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> thought these
                            estimates high, but nevertheless figures were substantial for Cyprus. It
                            was important all Cypriots, especially Turkish Cypriots, have confidence
                            in government and return to their homes and jobs. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> hoped those Turkish Cypriots
                            who did not wish to do so might go to Turkey.</p>
                        <p>He said GOC would assist all Cypriots, including Turkish Cypriots, in
                            various necessary ways to return to their homes and jobs. Cost of
                            rebuilding homes would be formidable. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> hoped international financial assistance would
                            be available. GOC had been losing one million pounds monthly in income
                            during recent troubles and he hoped it would soon be possible resume
                            development program.</p>
                        <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0093"/>
                        <p>I said attitude of GOC toward needy Cypriots, including Turkish Cypriots,
                            was most statesmanlike and would indicate to world GOC was ready to take
                            care of all of its people rather than only one segment.</p>
                        <p>I added I had been disappointed, following my return from US, to read
                            articles in Greek Cypriot press indicating US activities were being
                            curtailed and Greek Cypriots being let go for purpose of bringing
                            economic pressure on GOC. This type of analysis was wholly inaccurate. I
                            wished to assure him there had been no change in attitude of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> toward Cyprus and that we continued
                            ready to help Cyprus with its economic development as we could within
                            scope of our resources.</p>
                        <p>It had been necessary to suspend some programs such as Peace Corps and to
                            curtail others such as technical assistance for time being because
                            American staff could not function in many parts of Cyprus because of
                            present difficulties and because Greek Cypriot press continued to foment
                            anti-Americanism by charging that US was pro-Turkish. Fact of matter was
                            US was not only friendly to Turkey, but also to Greece and to Britain
                            and especially to Cyprus. I hoped <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would use his influence with press to explain
                            true American attitude and thus bring stop to this unfriendly criticism
                            which might have unsettling effect on friendly relations which had been
                            built up between US and Cyprus over years.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said he understood true
                            situation and realized US had always been friendly to Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> ducked issue of Greek Cypriot
                            press by saying American press (especially Christian Science Monitor)
                            seemed to be unfriendly to Cyprus. I commented it was not exactly fair
                            comparison. Greek Cypriot press might be expected to respond to
                            suggestions from him more readily than American press would respond to
                            suggestions from us.</p>

                                27, reported Turkish press reaction to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' refusal to permit Denktash to return to

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' appointment of
                                “temporary” ministers appeared to avoid violation of the Cypriot
                                Constitution. (Ibid., POL 15 CYP) Telegram 1039 from Nicosia, March
                                28, reported negative Turkish Cypriot reaction to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' actions. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Agree with Embassy Nicosia's conclusion reftel that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' action in appointing acting
                            ministers to replace Turks designed underscore Turk non-participation
                            and strengthen formal GOC control Turkish-allocated ministries. This
                            connection, Cyprus <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> PermRep Rossides
                            has informed <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> President that civil
                            servants who “deliberately refuse report to office” could not expect
                            “continue indefinitely be paid out of public funds”.</p>
                        <p>Timing these Greek-Cypriot tactics is interesting. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> apparently fully understands
                            that (1) Turk-Cypriots could strengthen their case and weaken his by
                            participation, (2) that such participation was not likely while security
                            forces were primarily GOC and British, and (3) that formal establishment
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> is strategic moment for
                            Kutchuk to insist on participation. He appears to have made moves re
                            Denktash and acting minister appointments to goad Turks into frittering
                            away energies in protests and legal arguments until opportunity has
                            passed. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' tactics will
                            probably succeed if Turk-Cypriots continue to sit on hands and feel
                            sorry for themselves.</p>
                        <p>If Kutchuk would return to his office because of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence, he could be serious embarrassment to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Even if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could insist successfully
                            that all measures of GOC taken during Kutchuk's absence are legal and
                            not subject to Vice-President's veto, he would have difficulty not
                            forwarding future bills or measures to Kutchuk as required by
                            constitution. His only effective alternatives would appear to be: (1) to
                            maintain that Kutchuk was rebel who tried to set up separate
                            Turk-Cypriot administration and therefore had lost authority in
                            government (difficult argument to sustain if GOC has, as it claims, been
                            sending invitations to Kutchuk and other Turk-Cypriot officials to
                            attend scheduled meetings) or (2) to maneuver Turk-Cypriots into holding
                            back from participation until too late.</p>
                        <p>He appears to be operating under second alternative. With each passing
                            day that his tactics perpetuate Turk-Cypriots boycott of government, <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0095"/>he increases general acceptance
                            GOC as presently constituted, strengthens his contention that
                            Turk-Cypriots are insurgents and weakens ability <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to remain neutral between two communities.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, British Embassy informs us <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has asked HMG to intercede with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and protest to UNSYG on

                                (Ibid.)</note> Department may recall that during 1959
                            Constitution-drafting period I was reporting from Nicosia that Rube
                            Goldberg contraption could work, but only given magnanimity on part of
                            Greeks and good will from all.</p>
                        <p>So much has happened since then to show that neither quality has many
                            exponents on this unhappy island that another attempt at a patchwork
                            solution can only breed further trouble. Situation obviously calls for
                            drastic action involving major effort by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies to support solution based on security needs of
                            area, but also recognizing generally accepted democratic principle of
                            majority rule.</p>
                        <p>Our own ideas as to once-for-all (para 5 Deptel 707) solution somewhat
                            like Alexander's approach to Gordian Knot, although without resultant
                            “partition” as in myth. Our recommendations will require considerable
                            selling to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> since we are proposing
                            recognize Greek Cypriot ascendancy and intransigence and their
                            insistence on a solution in accord with generally accepted standards of
                            self-determination based on majority rule. On this basis following
                            proposals submitted as outline of plan designed achieve over-all peace
                            and security in area.</p>
                        <p>1. Constitutional framework providing for one person-one vote majority
                            rule, with elections on basis of proportional representation.</p>
                        <p>2. Adequate safeguards for minorities (perhaps as with Swedes in
                            Finland).</p>
                        <p>3. Cyprus to be tied to Greece either by enosis or in some “associated”
                            status such as Puerto Rico. Greece would at minimum control foreign
                            policy and defense, perhaps leaving other facets of government to
                            Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>Would seem that only through some such device could <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> be convinced that security interests
                            being preserved and safeguarded. Do not see how independent Cyprus with
                            strong Communist Party organization could be accepted by Turks. Cyprus
                            could continue to be “used” in one way or another as shuttlecock in
                            Soviet-Western cold war in the area. Only as part of Greece and thereby
                            included in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> security system could
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> fears be mitigated. Part of such
                            concept could be transferring <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0097"/>of
                            Izmir joint Greek-Turkish headquarters to one of British bases (probably
                            Dhekelia) and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> giving up sovereignty
                            over all or most of area in favor of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base on sovereign “Greek” territory.</p>
                        <p>Whatever Mediator may propose that would be acceptable to Greek Cypriots
                            in their present ascendant position will require major selling effort
                            with Turks, and in this respect Greek Ambassador Delivanis correct in
                            his statement to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_WF1">Wilkins</persName> (Embtel 1070)<note n="3" xml:id="d29fn3">Telegram 1070 from Nicosia, April 5, reported that Delivanis
                                appeared to be taking a harder political line after his return from
                                consultations in Athens. (Ibid., POL 17 GR–CYP)</note> that US must
                            play major persuasive role—but this does not mean that efforts other
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners will not be
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>Further factor which Embassy considers essential to any lasting solution
                            is some form of assisted emigration for Turks who are convinced they can
                            no longer live with Greeks in Cyprus. This should involve setting up of
                            commission to handle transfer of properties on equitable basis as well
                            as other details of moves, including some provision for compensation for
                            damages. Agree with Department's observations para 3 Deptel re best
                            course of action for Mediator except with regards manner handling
                            proposals once formulated. Experience with Cyprus “solutions” which
                            presented publicly or leaked in some fashion not encouraging in past and
                            no reason believe one or other side would not act same way now,
                            particularly given existing inflamed and emotional situation.</p>
                        <p>At very least, believe proposals should be worked out and accepted by

                        <p>We must bear in mind how sensitive is Cypriot pride and how convinced

                        <p>6. Give us friendly government with which to negotiate satisfactory

                            could be interpreted as laying groundwork for Mediator's understanding
                            of GOC position.</p>
                        <p>For instance, they had not prepared any new draft Constitution, although
                            some thought had been devoted to this. She indicated her preoccupation
                            with certain difficulties involved in persuading Turkish Cypriots and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> accept Greek Cypriot line
                            regarding “adequate safeguards for minority.” She said it all very well
                            to spell out minority rights including free access to government jobs on
                            basis of merit, etc., etc., but when it came to describing method of

                            insuperable difficulties. What recourse would Turks have in event they
                            claimed discrimination? Constitutional Court had not proved effective

                            of problem was.</p>
                        <p>I agreed that under present circumstances of distrust and consequent lack
                            of confidence, it would be difficult persuade Turks that law would be
                            administered impartially, but suggested that there must be numerous
                            examples in other countries where experience of minority problems could
                            be drawn upon. In fact, experience of Swedish minority in Finland might
                            be instructive. I also took opportunity to play on old theme of
                            restoration of confidence in Turkish community by cessation of
                            harassment of Turks attempting to move in Nicosia area. I said I
                            recognized there was harassment on both sides, but with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> here, surely government could assume
                            posture of magnanimity and put onus for continuation of efforts keep two
                            communities apart on Turks. Mrs. Soulioti agreed that this might be
                            useful gambit, but that there had been a continued hardening of Greek
                            attitude towards Turkish community in view of unwillingness see <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> open Kyrenia Road and restore freedom of
                            access Iozablesia itself. I commented that I too had noted an
                            increasingly hard line in talking to Ministers and other leading members
                            of Greek Cypriot community.</p>
                        <p>This took form of maintaining that until such time as there was political
                            settlement satisfactory to Greeks or at least until Turkish community
                            here recognized fact that GOC was undisputed government, there was no
                            possibility of Turkish Ministers or even Turkish civil servants
                            returning to work. Mrs. Soulioti said that she did not go this far, but
                            that unless there was freedom of access for Greeks who have legitimate
                            business in present Turkish-controlled areas. (i.e., area north of
                            Nicosia and Kyrenia Road), she saw no reason why Turks should be allowed
                            come back to work in government in Greek area. (This strong attitude
                            reflects position taken by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in farewell conversation with Ambassador

                            pressure on Turk Army contingent all seemingly designed with some idea
                            of “unconditional surrender” and thereby complicating already almost

                        <p>1527. 1. I called on PriMin today at his home to introduce Anschuetz, new
                                <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Conversation devoted largely to Cyprus. I expressed our satisfaction
                            along lines of Dept's 1172<note n="2" xml:id="d31fn2">Telegram 1172,

                                settlement of the Cyprus issue. (Ibid.)</note> for Papandreou's
                            restrained reaction to recent Turkish moves (i.e. abrogation 1930 Treaty
                                etc.)<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">The 1930 Treaty of Friendship,

                            continued moderation on Greek side, particularly since events moving in
                            Greek favor. I said in order create conditions conducive to ultimate
                            settlement it essential that damage to Turkish prestige be held to
                            minimum and that his cooperation in restraining <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> this regard would be
                            essential. I pointed out that US had made conscious effort following
                            Cuban crisis to spare <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>
                            as much humiliation as possible.</p>
                        <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0101"/>
                        <p>2. PriMin agreed emphatically. He said that in his recent message to
                            Inonu—which he said was verbal one—he had stated that he recognized
                            Cyprus presented Turkish Govt with foreign and domestic political
                            problems (as it did for Greece), that it was difficult for either
                            country to retreat publicly from respective positions, but that two
                            countries must think of overall general interests in reaching final
                            settlement. Message emphasized importance to both countries of continued
                            Greek-Turkish friendship and that it was essential to resolve Cyprus
                            question in order that these relations could continue. Papandreou said
                            that Inonu had agreed but had commented that Cyprus treaties must be
                            honored.</p>
                        <p>3. I reiterated importance of preventing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from following line which would only provoke
                            Turks. In reply, PriMin said he agreed completely, and said that he now
                            has established “complete discipline” over <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He asserted he regretted <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' trip to Athens at present
                                time,<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">See <ref target="#d30fn4">footnote
                                    4, Document 30</ref>.</note> so soon after Makarios'
                            denunciation of alliance treaties, since it might be considered
                            “conspiracy” between two leaders. PriMin said his own prestige was now
                            at high point in Cyprus itself. In response to question he expressed
                            opinion that if vote for enosis were held in Cyprus now, it would be
                            unanimously supported by Cypriot public, whereas two months ago—before
                            his accession to power—Greece's position was such that majority would
                            have opposed enosis.</p>
                        <p>4. I said I hoped he would caution <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> about taking any action against Turkish unit on
                            island. He agreed, and said he had already forbidden <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to do such thing and would
                            reaffirm this warning when they met. Papandreou said he was holding
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> responsible for the
                            irregular Greek-Cypriot forces as well as the police. The PriMin said
                            his plan was for Greek unit to remain in its camp (to which it had
                            already retired) and then for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to
                            pressure the Turks to do same—in this way, he pointed out, Turks would
                            be isolated if they refused to follow suit.</p>
                        <p>5. PriMin in his frequent references to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> spoke disparagingly of Archbishop. He said
                            laughingly that while <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            was concerned with personal, temporal triumph, he preferred that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> be a sacrifice to
                            “the cause of Hellenism,” following which he would be prepared to accord
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> a hero's role in
                            Hellenic history. Papandreou continued that vis-à-vis himself <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had lost greatly in recent
                            weeks. When Anschuetz noted that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had met recently with Bishop of Kyrenia,<note n="5" xml:id="d31fn5"> Bishop Kyprianos, a strong proponent of
                                enosis.</note> PriMin said this was proof of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' present weak position, since
                            Bishop was <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' old rival,
                            and never in the past would he have consented to meet with him.</p>
                        <pb n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0102"/>
                        <p>Concerning role for Grivas, Papandreou said he preferred not to have
                            General go to island since he would rally support against <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and thus divide Cypriot
                            struggle. He said it was essential that unity be preserved.</p>
                        <p>6. PriMin then went on to discuss his policy for Cyprus. He said that in
                            order not provoke Turks he would not push for enosis at this point, or
                            even self-determination. Rather, he would press idea of “independence”
                            which he felt was principle that no one could oppose. The new character
                            of this independence would necessitate the abolishment of all recent
                            treaties which had been proved unworkable. However, the final settlement
                            should provide full and complete rights for minority, protected by
                            international guarantees. Self-determination and enosis would follow
                            naturally since independent state could take any action it wished. He
                            noted that Krishna Menon, in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, had
                            spoken against enosis, and that world opinion would be solidly behind
                            principle of independence but might balk at enosis with Greece as part
                            of settlement. By demanding complete independence rather than enosis or
                            self-determination defeat for Turks would be softened and victory for
                            Makarios would be more modest. PriMin seemed to feel enosis would be
                            even less palatable to Turks at present time than solution based on
                            “independence.”</p>
                        <p>7. Papandreou said he would cooperate with us in policy of “moderation”
                            re Cyprus question. However, he stressed again need for quick
                            settlement, since “time hurts.” He said he had told <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and he would repeat it, that
                            Greek Cypriots must avoid all provocation and that, even if a Greek is
                            killed, not to make reprisal but call upon <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He emphasized that policy of Greek Govt was “peace” and
                            he would make every effort to achieve that goal. PriMin said we must
                            give full support to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator in his
                            effort to find “democratic” solution.</p>
                        <p>8. PriMin then went on to stress importance for West of a quick end to
                            Cyprus question. He said it was unfortunate that Cypriot crisis had
                            occurred at all since it had given <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> opportunity to pose as champion of people
                            struggling for liberty, while US and Britain were cast in light of
                            opposing it. He continued that Communists had exploited this fact to
                            hilt, not only in Greece and Cyprus, but throughout world and had scored
                            point in world ideological battle. He noted that <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in particular had increased
                            his prestige by supporting the “peaceful way” against Chinese on one
                            hand while posing as champion of liberation movement on other. The
                            longer the Cyprus crisis remains unsettled the greater the gain to
                            international Communism.</p>
                        <p>9. At this point Papandreou noted newspaper report of a possible
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> visit to Cyprus.
                            He said he was going to tell <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> such a visit was completely out of
                            question.</p>
                        <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0103"/>
                        <p>10. PriMin said he was deeply pleased by fact Greek public opinion
                            undergoing change for better in recent weeks regarding Americans due to
                            report about change in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> policy towards
                            Cyprus. He said he understood perfectly difficulty of US position, which
                            was to steer impartial course between two trusted allies and he could
                            understand our reluctance to take sides. However, as between two friends
                            this policy could only be determined on basis essential merits of case
                            and justice of cause. In case of Cyprus it was impossible for 18 percent
                            of population in Cyprus to run country at expense of majority 82
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>11. PriMin said he was concerned about position Greek communities in
                            Turkey, but he did not think it fruitful to talk of exodus of Istanbul
                            Greeks. Concerning Patriarch, he said he personally would not mind
                            transfer of the Patriarchy to Mt. Athos, but that the Communists were
                            pushing for the expulsion of the Patriarch, so that Moscow could lay
                            claim to world leadership of Orthodoxy. This, he said, made him uneasy,
                            since religion was one of main stakes in world ideological battle
                            between Communists and democracy.</p>
                        <p>12. PriMin then launched attack against British policy in Cyprus. While
                            he understood US position, he could not understand British, which had
                            been “frantically” pro-Turkish. When I noted Turks were criticizing
                            British also, he said that was because Turks wanted even more support.
                            He referred in passing to newspaper reports that British had undermined
                            MacArthur position against Chinese in Korea and added that British
                            policy could not be trusted.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> PriMin was in great form and did most of
                            the talking in 75 minute session. His optimistic mood reflects the
                            feeling here that the Greek cause is winning out. We believe we must
                            take with a grain of salt his assertions about his control over
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> until we have more
                            proof of it than we have at the moment. He seemed acutely aware of the
                            domestic Turkish problem regarding Cyprus which I think explains
                            moderation of Greek responses up to present point. On other hand, it
                            seemed clear that he had done little thinking about ways to sweeten pill
                            for Turks if final settlement goes against Turk interests.</p>
                        <p>We have reservations about Papandreou's estimate of preference for
                            solution based on independent Cyprus rather than on union with Greece.
                            His policy seems designed more to satisfy Afro-Asian bloc and exigencies
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> tactics rather than to appease
                            Turks. We interpret his solution as meaning that under circumstances,
                            “independence” solution would be enforced by weight of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> opinion and thereby hopefully avoid
                            direct confrontation between Greece and Turkey which would be provoked
                            by solution based on self-determination or enosis.</p>

                        <p>1076. Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> gave
                            following response to Turk Ambassador's request for US views on Turk
                            Government's intention request SC consideration recent developments on
                            Cyprus:</p>
                        <p>1. Question of calling <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting
                            essentially <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> decision. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would not oppose meeting if <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> decides call <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. However, we do not see constructive results; in fact,
                            we see risk discussion might be turned against Turks and in particular
                            focus on position Turk contingent. In that event, we are not sure SC
                            action would be a good one, since SC might insist on Turk contingent's
                            returning to barracks.</p>
                        <p>2. We have considered whether there are ways in which we could limit SC
                            consideration to debate and airing of issue. We doubt <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration can be limited to this. Our
                            Embassy in Ankara indicates your Government has in mind a simple res
                            making it clear Makarios is offending party. We doubt such res could be
                            obtained. At best, res would be even-handed exhortation to both sides
                            and, more likely, res would seek to pressure GOT move its contingent to
                            barracks.</p>
                        <p>3. As result careful study and appraisal, we suggest following steps as
                            alternatives:</p>
                        <p>a. that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> send letter for circulation
                            to Members <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> stating its views and
                            reserving right to call meeting at later date;</p>
                        <p>b. that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> continue its informal
                            démarches with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> in New York and with
                            Gyani, with view to bringing end to incidents and pressing <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> take action to find ways give relief to
                            some localities where Turk-Cypriots find themselves in difficult
                            position;</p>
                        <p>c. in view indications that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            appreciates Turk concern over pullback to barracks, perhaps <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> should make counter-proposal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which might be suggestion that Turk
                            contingent move into encampment near road rather than into barracks;</p>
                        <p>d. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will increase our consultation
                            efforts both in New York and in Nicosia to be as helpful as possible. In
                            particular, USG prepared press <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> see
                            what further it can do with respect Turk localities and villages under
                            siege and to urge <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> have its force
                            interpret its mandate as vigorously as possible. In addition, we would
                            consider any other steps that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> might
                            develop.</p>
                        <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0105"/>
                        <p>4. We see certain encouraging signs, perhaps because we in position get
                            more accurate information than Turk Ambassador in Nicosia and perhaps
                            because of our close relations with <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName>. These include:</p>
                        <p>a. while it true <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> plans use joint
                            patrols employing Greek-Cypriot policemen in Greek quarters, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> also plans use Turk-Cypriot policemen in
                            Turk quarters;</p>
                        <p>b. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seeking increase number its forces
                            and to get them in place as well as develop a non-Cypriot police
                            contingent which should contribute further to stabilizing situation.
                            (specific mention was made of Austrian police increment);</p>
                        <p>c. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has stated its readiness to provide
                            adequate security for Turk members of Government so that Vice President
                            and Ministers can attend meetings, although we recognize impediments
                            Makarios has placed in this regard;</p>
                        <p>d. we understand your Government has now received confirmation that
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force, and not Cypriot police, has
                            taken over one road.</p>
                        <p>Menemencioglu responded he pleased hear about international police
                            contingent. Police force currently monopoly Greek-Cypriots. Constitution
                            provides for 2,000 police force, of which 600 should be Turk-Cypriots.
                            Turk-Cypriots no longer in force, and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had illegally increased size of police force by
                            5,000 without consultation with Vice President. Ambassador understood
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> had said he could
                            accept as legitimate police with appropriate authority only those
                            persons who had card identifying themselves as such issued by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Ambassador said it obvious
                            no Turk-Cypriots could obtain such a card from <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that, therefore, no
                            Turk-Cypriot could be recognized by <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> as policeman, even former 600 Turk policemen.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said he assumed <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not have told us they would use
                            Turk police unless they had plans to do so. (Would appreciate <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> and Nicosia comment on question
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> acceptance of cards issued by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as evidence member
                            of police force. If this is system envisaged, how can Turk-Cypriot
                            police obtain card?)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> said his Government
                            very unhappy and worried about <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' visit Athens. GOC seeking Greek assistance in
                            getting Turk contingent off island. In response Acting Secretary's
                            question, Ambassador said his Government views possibility Grivas return
                            Cyprus as serious. Ambassador continued he personally very unhappy with
                            Greek Government's actions. He said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            had at no time condemned <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' actions; in fact, Papandreou had encouraged
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> by saying Greeks
                            would stand with Cypriots to the end. No Greek has said anything against
                            the bloody actions of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.
                            It is Papandreou, he continued, who brought <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Grivas together. Situation would be grave
                            if Grivas went Cyprus since it would mean encouragement of military
                            action. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> should emulate <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> action following anti-Greek riots
                            Istanbul 1955 when <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> condemned these
                            riots, paid damages, passed parliamentary res against action, and had
                            Greek <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0106"/>flag, which torn down
                            during riots, raised with military honors by Cabinet Minister. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has not acted this way, and has instead
                            closely associated itself with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> with result that situation in Cyprus now out of
                            hand. In conclusion, Ambassador said emphatically that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should not do anything rash
                            about Turkish contingent.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador said he would convey <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> views
                            to his Government, which he was sure would be most appreciative. In
                            particular, GOT would appreciate our increased activity at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in Nicosia. He would also hope this
                            would include Athens. Acting Secretary said we have in mind further
                            consultations with Greek Government.</p>
                        <p>Acting Secretary stated that Belcher arriving Ankara Monday for two-day
                            visit. He believed Belcher should have opportunity discuss current
                            situation with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. (Ankara please
                            arrange appropriate meetings with Turk officials for Belcher.)</p>

                            mandate less broad than that of UNOC. March 4 Resolution calls upon

                            such numerical superiority. Clearly this is not intent of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res.</p>

                            fact that Greek Cypriot forces apparently continue move about at will in
                            their campaign against Turk Cypriots. These forces today estimated to
                            number 15,000, or more than twice planned strength of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>. (Rolz-Bennett assertion <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force now at 7,000 does not agree <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0108"/>with our figures which place
                            operational strength at less than 5,500.) We recognize impracticability
                            seeking disarm Greek Cypriot forces. We believe, however, that unless
                            they are soon disbanded or otherwise stopped from continuing their
                            campaign against Turk Cypriots, <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> will not be able successfully carry out its
                            mission. We believe <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>

                            about with impunity. We recognize number of recent incidents actually

                        <p>3. We note (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>'s 3719) that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is continuing his efforts bring Greek
                            and Turkish contingents under <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName>'s command and Eralp statement <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would accept this provided Turk
                            contingent not ordered to return to barracks. We see immediate problem
                            as need to move Turk contingent from Kyrenia road area making it
                            possible open this road to regular traffic. We understand <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> prepared assure <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> that road, which runs through Turk business and
                            residential areas, would be patrolled by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force and not Greek Cypriot police. We can appreciate
                            SYG's unwillingness publicly accept any conditions to placing contingent
                            under UN command. We feel might accomplish this through suggestion you
                            have already made, i.e., that contingent not be asked return to barracks
                            but be permitted encamp in location which would clear Kyrenia road
                            without forcing GOT lose face by appearing bow to UN request which
                            essentially same as that made by Makarios on March 29 prior to
                            repudiating Treaty of Alliance.</p>
                        <p>Dept feels it important that problem of Turk contingent be resolved
                            quickly. Ankara has put <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            on notice that any move against contingent would bring vigorous
                            response. Although <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> appears
                            understand serious consequences any incident involving contingent and

                            policy now to be that this essentially a Turk-Greek matter and that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> approach will be put all
                            possible pressure on <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. When I
                            protested that this likely drive the two nations farther apart rather
                            than facilitate mutually acceptable solution Cyprus, he replied that to
                            contrary due centuries of experience with Greeks, Turks regard this as
                            only method force Greeks collaborate. He likened Greece to house cat
                            which would defy man until forced in corner from which no escape where
                            man could pin it down and if necessary kill it. Current series of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> anti-Greek actions designed force
                            Greece into this corner. He protested that from the outset Turks had
                            tried to get the Greeks to solve the problem jointly with Turkey without
                            avail and present measures seem only solution. I remarked that Turkey's
                            much publicized preparations for amphibious operations had seemed to me
                            to have exactly the opposite effect and that in fact, the Greeks had
                            shown no indication of willingness cooperate but rather favor a
                            withdrawal even when they expressed greatest concern over reported
                            exchange of Turkish troops for border guards in Thrace. He replied that
                            Turkey would not move into northern Greece in any case as such an
                            operation would have no value for them. He said he felt that should the
                            Turks undertake a military operation, it might very possibly be against
                            one of the Greek islands. In further development of the theme that Turks
                            must have some sort of a face saving solution before too long and that
                            if the US does not take steps to assist in the realization of such a
                            solution, Turkey will do so herself, he said somewhat ominously “I tell
                            you that there will be action—maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe
                            next month, but there will be action”.</p>

                        <p>1. General response Turkish senior officers (notably Admiral Eyiceoglu,
                            J–2) (General Atalay, J–3) to queries War College students on Cyprus
                            situation was one of continuation Turk military feeling close affinity
                            US military, nor was there any indication this feeling would diminish
                            despite political developments. One gets the impression that all briefed
                            and reiterating same party line and that in fact, Turks desperately
                            seeking any measures reach solution to the problem without too much loss
                            of face and still hoping against hope US will be able assist. Sunalp's
                            remarks probably part of larger design scare us into doing something to
                            keep Turks from taking action inimical to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interests. We assessed earlier threats to conduct
                            amphibious operation on Cyprus as same technique and they may be trying

                            evening <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediation effort is at
                            “impasse” following his discussions at Ankara April 18–19 and his first
                            working meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            April 20.</p>
                        <p>Both Turkish Cypriots and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> have told
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> federation is only
                            acceptable solution. Federation they have now defined as division of
                            island into Turkish area in north and Greek area in south with
                            compulsory population exchange. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> lent me in confidence copy of memorandum from
                            Kutchuk setting forth “Principles of Federal Constitution of Republic of
                            Cyprus.” Text in next following telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d35fn2">Telegram 1134 from Nicosia, April 22. (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> said he received very
                            similar communication from <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> adamant that Turkish Cypriots are
                            “separate community” and not “minority.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> sounded out <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> views on enosis as lesser evil than
                            independent Cyprus ruled by Greek majority. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> refused contemplate enosis under any circumstances.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> argued continued presence of
                            Turkish troops on Cyprus essential for security of Turkey although there
                            no objection to presence of Greek troops also.</p>
                        <p>Visit to Ankara gave <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> more
                            vivid realization of Turkey's interest in Cyprus. He seems to have been
                            very much impressed by Turkish military strength and readiness to
                            intervene and twice commented that Greek Cypriots did not know what
                            great risks they were taking and that Turkish forces could sweep island
                            in two days. He also commented favorably on Inonu's political wisdom and
                            restraint.</p>
                        <p>Re possible “summit” meeting of Inonu and Papandreou, <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> said Inonu was not opposed in
                            principle but thought way would have to be prepared by meetings at lower
                            level. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> himself thought
                            such <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0112"/>meeting might eventually be
                            useful or even necessary, but felt he should first have more time to
                            explore possibilities of mediation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> discussed Turkish
                            federation proposal with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> showing latter copy of Kutchuk's memorandum.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> rejected Turkish
                            proposal out of hand, evidently arguing federation identical with
                            partition and insisting Turkish Cypriots had to be satisfied with normal
                            minority rights.</p>
                        <p>Present situation <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>
                            described as “total impasse,” with “no light at end of tunnel.” While he
                            admitted all concerned might be starting at beginning positions from
                            which they might retreat as mediation progressed, he appeared seriously
                            concerned about rigidity of Turks and Greek Cypriots and by their
                            apparent willingness to run risk of war not only on island but also
                            between Turkey and Greece. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> professed to be at loss to understand how there
                            could be such bitter animosity between nationalities who had every
                            interest in maintaining friendship and who have no basic ideological
                            differences. He added that pessimism would not, however, be consistent
                            with his role as Mediator. Citing as his motto for present situation
                            Finnish saying that “the pigs will come home with the frost,” he
                            expressed hope that decline of island's economy and increased
                            difficulties of living would gradually make Cypriots on either side more
                            tractable. He thought there might be moderate elements in both
                            communities whose voices are yet to be heard. He furthermore took note
                            of value of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> political
                            staff's efforts to restore some normality to intercommunal
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> confirmed that he will
                            go to Athens for talks with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> next
                            weekend. He thought he might find more divergence between Greek and
                            Greek Cypriot views than between Turk and Turkish Cypriot. He will also
                            go on to London and to Paris, where he will report to U Thant April
                            29.</p>
                        <p>He was expecting his political advisor Robin Miller (New Zealand) to
                            arrive last night.</p>
                        <p>At end of our conversation I asked Mediator whether there was anything we
                            could do to help. He replied “no, not yet” and then added wryly “except
                            to have your government keep persuading Greece and Turkey not to go to
                            war.”</p>

                        <p>2779. Our sense of the situation in Cyprus based on reliable intelligence
                            is:</p>
                        <p>(a) That the Greek Cypriots are undertaking the attack on St. Hilarion
                            Castle as a systematic operation designed to test the strength and will
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force. If this attack succeeds
                            it will almost certainly lead to a series of systematic attacks in order
                            to achieve a fait accompli to present to the Mediator.</p>
                        <p>(b) At same time there is a developing Gotterdammerung spirit among the
                            Turkish Cypriots that may at almost any moment result in a widespread
                            and suicidal violence which could quickly lead to civil war throughout
                            Island.</p>
                        <p>(c) We believe that events can rapidly get out of hand unless: First, the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force moves quickly and vigorously
                            to take all necessary steps to stop St. Hilarion action. Second, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> issues strong and unambiguous statement
                            calling on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to call off
                            Greek Cypriots. Third, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> sends strong
                            private appeal to Papandreou urging him exercise necessary restraint on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(d) The consequences of failure to act definitively would not only be
                            tragic and dangerous situation in Cyprus; it could discredit <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping for future and could well
                            lead to Turkish intervention with all frightful consequences which that
                            would entail.</p>
                        <p>We suggest you also make following additional concrete suggestions:</p>
                        <p>1. Urge <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to send instructions to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> to have <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force exercise greater initiative;</p>
                        <p>2. If <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Force needs more equipment to
                            increase mobility and cope with situation, it should seek such
                            assistance;</p>
                        <p>3. Reiterate strongly our interpretation of the mandate based on Security
                            Council Resolution of 4 March 1964; and</p>
                        <p>4. Make two suggestions contained in paragraph 6 and penultimate
                            paragraph of Nicosia's 1161, repeated <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 386.<note n="2" xml:id="d36fn2">Telegram 1161 from

                        <p>The President, after greeting <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> cordially, said with emphasis that he wished to
                            commend the Turks on how they had acted with such great restraint and
                            statesmanship in recent weeks. He knew what a trial the Cyprus crisis
                            was to Turkey and how lucky we all were to have so great a man as Inonu
                            at the helm during such a period. “So don't lose your heads now,” he
                            said to <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>. “It's always
                            darkest just before the dawn. Give the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            a little more time to work out a solution.” <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> agreed that Turkey had acted with “great
                            restraint” but “we must avoid that the bill should now be paid by
                            Turkey.” <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said he had told
                            his Prime Minister the previous night how very pleased he was with his
                            talks here and with the US attitude.</p>
                        <p>The President came back to the theme of how it was important to avoid a
                            shooting war over Cyprus. War, as he put it, solves nothing. Our<pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0115"/> experience has been that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> can finally work something out
                            which will be acceptable to all parties in situations like these. But if
                            people start shooting, the whole situation is changed. Other powers are
                            drawn in and a new and far graver problem is created.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> pointed out that so far
                            Turkey had refrained from exercising their undoubted right of action in
                            this case. Now that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was there, it
                            was “not possible for us to intervene any more.”</p>
                        <p>“Inonu is a hero”, the President said. We applaud him and his policies.
                            We will do anything we can to support the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in working out a peaceful solution. Let's try everything
                            to avoid a clash. Some solution can and must be found. The President
                            analogized to the problem of our railway settlement. It had taken five
                            years but we finally settled it last week. We salute Inonu and were
                            tremendously grateful that he had acted with such statesmanship at a
                            time when others did not display the same qualities. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> interjected that “our antagonist
                            took advantage of our moderation and is seeking to inflict humiliation
                            on us.” The President granted that they were bullies but world opinion
                            would know what they had done. He wished <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> to tell Inonu that the President was his friend;
                            he, the President, remembered extremely well his visit to Ankara and how
                            he and Inonu had been waylaid by the crowds.</p>
                        <p>Returning again to the importance of avoiding a shooting war, the
                            President commented that we are worried about some signs of Turkish
                            preparations, for example, the cancellation of leaves. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> explained that “we have to be
                            prepared.” The President replied that he should tell Inonu right away of
                            our admiration for him and how we count on his continued restraint.
                            “Tell Inonu”, he said, “I haven't got a better friend. And I'm proud of
                            your people. We are always going to be stout allies.” <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> again assured him that the Turks
                            would not intervene.</p>
                        <p>The President then told Messrs. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName>
                            to see what we could do with the Greeks and Cypriots. When Senator
                            Fulbright was in Athens we could send him to Papandreou and tell him how
                            concerned we were.<note n="2" xml:id="d37fn2">On May 2, President

                                “reinforcing” U.S. efforts to preserve peace in the Aegean region.
                                The President outlined his objectives in sending Fulbright in a May

                                7–8, The Hague and Copenhagen May 8–13. He reported to the President
                                on his trip on May 15. In telegram 1304 to Athens, May 2, the
                                Department of State informed the Embassy that in addition to “fact
                                finding,” Fulbright would seek in talks with Papandreou and Inonu,
                                “To move GOG to restrain Greek Cypriots more effectively and to
                                assure <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> that its policy of
                                restraint is appreciated and will prove fruitful. He will avoid any
                                impression that USG has preconceived plans for ultimate solution.”

                            we had just urged restraint on the Greek <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0116"/>Government the previous night. The President's view was
                            that we should be as tough as necessary. The Greeks must not humiliate
                            the Turks. We should go in and press <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as well. When Talbot commented that we had used
                            up most of our leverage with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, the President's reaction was that we should
                            use up whatever was left if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> expressed
                            his great appreciation for the President's words and assured him that
                            his message to Inonu would be sent immediately. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> mentioned that the Turks
                            had a second bit of good news while here—they had been assured by the
                            Department of State that the US would not support any solution which
                            would humiliate Turkey. The President fully agreed.</p>
                        <p>As Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> left,
                            the President gave him two medallions, one for the Prime Minister and

                            impressed by fact that very difficult situation in island was a matter
                            of great concern at highest levels USA. I said President himself was
                            kept <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0117"/>fully informed of
                            developments on day-to-day basis and that he had taken personal interest
                            in events in Cyprus. Said we were pledged to support <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts find solution and added that one
                            of most difficult events to place in proper perspective had been
                            fighting around St. Hilarion which appeared to have been deliberate use
                            of force to gain purely military objective during time when all govts
                            concerned had been pledged to carry out terms of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> res.</p>
                        <p>The President said he could appreciate fact that fighting at St. Hilarion
                            might not be fully explicable to people abroad but that in his view this
                            was defensible objective on part of his govt (Gen Pantelides, Comander
                            of Home Guard, had made similar presentation to me just before going in
                            see President). He claimed that Turks had been extending their positions
                            both to east and west of Castle and that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had appeared unwilling or powerless to stop them. He
                            added that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appeared to be acting as
                            “conciliatory commission” rather than peace-keeping force. He asked what
                            might be expected on the part of Greek Cypriots in face of this sort of
                            “provocation” which was not so easily identifiable as gun fire. Quiet
                            infiltration by Turks in effort to consolidate their hold on northern
                            range was more difficult pinpoint than outright hostility involving gun
                            fire. Having accomplished objective of rolling back Turkish forward
                            positions, he had issued the statement claiming Greeks had reached their
                            objective and they had no need to take the Castle itself.</p>
                        <p>He added that something had to be done about continued harassing
                            indiscriminate fire from Castle into Karmi village. Roll-back helped but
                            probably would not completely stop. (Comment: Turks were extending
                            positions and have been firing into Karmi but Greeks have accomplished
                            more than mere roll-back. They now command Turk airfield at Krini as
                            well as Aghirda and other villages on south slope.)</p>
                        <p>I said that everyone in Washington had been much relieved and encouraged
                            at recent statements by both himself and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> of renewed determination to cooperate with
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in creating a situation which
                            might be more conducive to finding of a political solution.</p>
                        <p>In discussing need to avoid further violence and take steps restore
                            confidence among Turk Cypriots I raised question of SecGen's
                                report.<note n="4" xml:id="d38fn4">For text of this report, dated
                                April 29, see U.N. Doc. S/5671. Annex I to the report is printed in

                            this was a very useful report and that his govt was ready to cooperate
                            in every possible way toward achievement of UNSYG's objectives. He did
                            say that there would be great difficulty with some of items mentioned,
                            in particular reintegration of police force and the opening of area
                            north of Nicosia. With regard to Kyrenia Road, I said I hoped that some
                            compromise might be worked out whereby his govt would not necessarily
                            insist on Greek Cypriot patrols but might as first step agree to merely
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> patrols. His Beatitude said he was
                            prepared <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80" facs="0118"/>cooperate on this point
                            but that he felt <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence would not be
                            sufficient to permit Greek community to use road. He pointed to fact
                            that the road through Kokkina area was presently being patrolled by
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> but there were many new Turkish
                            fortifications and Greeks were most reluctant to use it.</p>
                        <p>We discussed arrival of Gen Karayannis<note n="5" xml:id="d38fn5">Newly-appointed Commander of the Cypriot National Guard.</note> and
                            Archbishop indicated that there were two purposes in bringing him here.
                            First was establishment of discipline among various fighter elements in
                            hope of avoiding undirected and dangerous action by irresponsible
                            elements within armed groups. Second was to create disciplined,
                            well-trained and well equipped force which could meet at least for time
                            the external threat posed by possibility of Turkish invasion. He said
                            Karayannis was not needed for purpose of bringing Greek Cypriot force
                            efficiency up to enable it control Turkish Cypriots. They were already
                            in position to do so.</p>
                        <p>We discussed briefly question of General Grivas with me expressing
                            opinion that it was perhaps better that objective be accomplished
                            through Gen Karayannis because of predictably adverse Turkish reaction
                            to Grivas' return. The Archbishop agreed but added that in his own
                            opinion General would not have directed his energies against Turks but
                            on contrary would purposely have asserted restraining influence on those
                            elements in fighter group who were particularly anti-Turkish.</p>
                        <p> Archbishop said he had had very interesting talk with Mediator after his
                            return from Ankara confirming that he had received from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> written copy of Turkish
                            position as given in Ankara. He said that Turkish position was so far
                            from anything which could be considered by Greeks that he feared
                            Mediator's job would require much longer time than anyone had at first
                            expected. He was seeing him Monday or Tuesday when he returned from his
                            trip to Athens, Paris and London and he hoped there might be something
                            more encouraging to tell me when he next saw me. President reiterated
                            his oft-repeated pledge that he hoped work with Mediator <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> in spirit of cooperation and in
                            atmosphere of peace and tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>Conversation concluded with reference to my looking forward to an early
                            opportunity present credentials once signed copy arrived from
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>As usual, Archbishop was pleasant, witty and the soul of reason. However,
                            I have no reason be encouraged believe he will keep his word to the
                            letter, although I doubt we shall see more such direct actions as that
                            at St. Hilarion unless there is direct provocation.</p>

                        <p>1663. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>, who prior to my return last
                            night acting as Charge, called on FonMin Costopoulos yesterday evening
                            at latter's request. Pilavakis, Director Fourth Political Division
                            (including Cyprus affairs), was also present.</p>
                        <p>Conversation, which lasted almost three-quarters of an hour, was
                            dominated by highly emotional recapitulation by Costopoulos of
                            well-established <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> theses on Cyprus
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Costopoulos began by saying that he was speaking as friend and that he
                            would like to know what is real mission Senator Fulbright. It must be
                            clearly understood that Greece cannot be expected to make further
                            sacrifice with regard to Cyprus problem. Greece had received the visits
                            of <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SD2">Stikker</persName> and now Fulbright; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and the Canadian Minister for
                            External Affairs had only that morning requested to see Costopoulos at
                            The Hague—obviously in connection with Cyprus. There is no reason in
                            justice why Greece should be called upon to abandon the basic principles
                            of democracy in Cyprus because Turks are obstructing self-determination
                            and exerting unjustifiable pressures in other areas of Greek-Turkish
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> replied he was certain FonMin
                            appreciated personal stature as well as key position of Senator
                            Fulbright in conduct American foreign relations, that Fulbright was
                            coming principally reflect deep concern felt at highest levels of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> with regard possibility increasing
                            deterioration in Greek-Turkish relations and to inform himself at first
                            hand with regard to views of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. He
                            emphasized Senator Fulbright not coming to propose a solution and that
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> strongly supports role of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator in evolving political
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Costopoulos spoke with considerable heat and bitterness regarding recent
                            emergency session of <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> and Birgi's
                                attack<note n="2" xml:id="d39fn2">At a May 2 special meeting of the

                                May 2, reported on Birgi's statement and the Greek response.
                                (Ibid.)</note> during session. He said he wanted <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> clearly to understand Greek-Turkish
                            confrontation during forthcoming Ministerial Meeting would be
                            catastrophic and that precise consequences might be difficult to
                            anticipate. History of Greek-Turkish relations did not begin only in
                            December 1963, and in the event that this question became a matter of
                            debate in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0120"/>Meeting, Greeks would be forced
                            open long dossier of grievances against Turks. Costopoulos was
                            particularly bitter in his references to Stikker. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had been shocked hear <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> say that in event of a Greek-Turkish

                            allies to intervene and that foreign aid would likely be

                            had impression Stikker's activities were encouraging Turks pursue an

                            might not be an obligation for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies intervene, it was impossible to consider that the allies (by
                            inference the US) could stand aside indifferent to the moral obligation
                            support Greece in event of Turkish attack.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> said that he was confident <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> not encouraging Turks adopt more
                            aggressive attitude but that Stikker expressing personal point of view
                            based on his own responsibilities to the Alliance. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_SD2">Stikker</persName> was personally convinced that

                            intervention at moment of attacks on Saint Hilarion. US is well aware
                            that open debate during <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Ministerial Meeting might well not be constructive but that we do hope
                            that it might be possible during forthcoming meeting to create situation
                            where Greek-Turkish discussions on bilateral issues might be
                            contemplated. Visit is precisely in order to avoid intolerable
                            circumstances in which US would be placed in event of Greek-Turkish
                            hostilities that US bending every effort to encourage restraint on
                            respective parties and wholeheartedly supporting efforts of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator. US believed enhanced
                            effectiveness of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, the recent
                            statements of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and
                            Papandreou's recent intervention with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would produce circumstances in which more
                            rational atmosphere would prevail in Cyprus and make more rapid
                            rehabilitation of situation possible. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had been gravely concerned at moment of Greek-Cypriot
                            attacks in Kyrenia Road area that Turkish military intervention might
                            occur. Because of impossible situation which would have been created in
                            event of Greek-Turkish hostilities <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            had intervened with Papandreou and Inonu and President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had asked Senator Fulbright to
                            visit Athens and Ankara. Moreover, although <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> quite naturally separates Cyprus problem from other
                            Greek-Turkish bilateral problems, it is perfectly apparent that GOT
                            possesses capability of exercising tremendous pressures on Greek
                            interests in Istanbul and elsewhere. Consequently, we must proceed in
                            full recognition of tactical situation as it exists and in such a manner
                            as to limit damage to Greek interests, to Greek-Turkish relations and to

                        <p>Costopoulos alluded to recent <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> statement regarding Cyprus,<note n="4" xml:id="d39fn4">In a May 4 interview in <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, Chairman <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> supported <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' position.</note> pointing out Soviets are

                            prevent Communists and extreme leftist elements in Cyprus and in Greece
                            from monopolizing strong nationalist role and exploiting deep-seated
                            popular emotions on this issue. Costopoulos suggested that if Greece
                            were abandoned by all of her allies in her search for democratic

                            people to look with increasing favor on those who were prepared to
                            support them, i.e. USSR. He also observed that if the situation
                            deteriorated further it would not be British, concerning whose policies
                            all Greeks are cynical, but the Americans who would be held responsible
                            in public mind.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> called on me yesterday
                            evening and gave quite discouraging account of mediation efforts to
                            date.</p>
                        <p>In Ankara <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> had found
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> adamant on “federation” which
                            would separate Greek and Turkish communities. In Athens <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had said it would accept any solution
                            acceptable to other parties and had talked “nonsense” about “majority
                            rule” and “self-determination” while professing to reject enosis. In
                            London HMG had “no policy”, and this seemed to be position of USA as
                            well. Turkish Cypriots repeatedly refused discuss, even on hypothetical
                            basis, anything but their “federation” proposal. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had not yet furnished
                            promised written proposals re guarantees of Turkish Cypriot rights, but
                            would probably do so within week.</p>
                        <p>Since mediation getting nowhere, <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> said he plans proceed wrap up activities here,
                            at least for present. He intends, without waiting for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' proposals, to put to both
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> certain written questions re
                            measures to guarantee Turkish Cypriot rights. He believes Turkish
                            Cypriots may well not reply. He will give them two weeks and then will
                            submit his report to UNSYG. He is determined return to his post in
                            Stockholm, where he can “meditate in comfort”, in mid-June. There he
                            will remain available if developments warrant further intervention by
                            Mediator.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> had little to say about
                            contents of his report, probably because he has not yet finished putting
                            his thoughts in order. He did say that as international lawyer he
                            condemned repudiation of international agreements “whether by Russians,
                            Hitler, or <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>” and would
                            so state in report. He also seemed be pondering idea of recommending
                            proposal for solution which would proceed from Constitution of 1960 but
                            would give Greek Cypriots more in way of majority rule while assuring
                            greater protection of Turkish Cypriot rights and security by providing
                            for (1) quasi-federal system under which “five or six” areas with
                            predominantly Turkish population would have certain measure of autonomy
                            in communal matters, (2) long-term <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            observer role, and international participation in or supervision of
                            court system.</p>

                        <p>Since he had not yet decided whether he should do so, I urged Tuomioja
                            make concrete recommendation for solution in his report, as this would
                            at least provide impetus for further discussion of negotiated solution.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> said he saw
                            advantages of specific recommendation.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I believe <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> would give considerable weight to any proposal

                            lend its support, but I recognize complexity of our interests in this
                            area make it very difficult commit ourselves to such proposal in time to
                            influence mediation. Failing this, we can best assist Tuomioja by
                            redoubling our efforts to make clear to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> that one cannot in Cyprus, any more than in other
                            former colonial areas, successfully impose any solution—especially an
                            undemocratic one—on population which is prepared to fight, is assured of
                            assistance from outside, and believes it can mobilize world opinion on
                            own behalf in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Turkish position on
                            island is being steadily weakened, in comparison to growing Greek
                            Cypriot resources, as present situation continues, and Turkish
                            community's best hope is to cut its losses by reasonable compromise.
                            Continued smuggling of arms to Turkish Cypriot forces would seem at best
                            futile effort and one which can only lead to bloodier clashes as time
                            wears on with no solution.</p>
                        <p>I urgently recommend Secretary make these points in meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> May 11 and attempt

                            even less conducive to reaching political settlement and will probably
                            find Turkish position further eroded while that of Greeks strengthened

                        <p>Tosec 27. For Secretary from Acting Secretary. Disturbing developments in
                            the Cyprus situation lead me to think that you should probably have some
                            talks in The Hague with key <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Foreign Ministers, looking toward possible common action at the
                            appropriate point. In this telegram I shall try to sum up the situation
                            as I see it.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>, the Finnish Mediator,
                            while a reticent man, has given some vague foreshadowing of his
                            thinking. Proceeding from the Constitution of 1960, he is considering
                            proposals that would give the Greek Cypriots more in the way of majority
                            rule. In order to assure the Turk Cypriots of their rights and security,
                            he is toying with the idea of (a) a quasi-federal system under which
                            five or six areas with predominant Turkish populations would have a
                            certain autonomy in communal affairs and (b) a long-term <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observer and international participation
                            in or supervision of the court system.</p>
                        <p>2. While this represents progress over what appeared as his first
                            thoughts, I am confident that the Turks would not presently be prepared
                            to accept a solution along these lines.</p>
                        <p>3. While it is not entirely clear what his plans are (and there are
                            conflicting stories) Tuomioja has indicated to us that he intends to put
                            both to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> written questions regarding
                            measures to guarantee Turkish Cypriot rights. He will give the parties
                            about two weeks to respond. He believes Turkish Cypriots may not reply.
                            He intends then to submit his report to UNSYG. Thereafter he will return
                            to his post in Stockholm where he can “mediate in comfort” until
                            mid-June and remain unless developments warrant further intervention by
                            the Mediator.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s proposed course of
                            action could result in a gravely dangerous situation. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> might well make the heroic
                            gesture of agreeing to accept the Mediator's proposals. <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> would almost certainly reject
                            them. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would then go
                            into the Security Council and demand that they be given effect. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would almost certainly have to

                            vote against the proposals of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Mediator.</p>

                        <p>5. The Soviet Government would presumably seek to play a double game of
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> while at the
                            same time exploiting the growing disenchantment of the Turks. What the
                            Soviet Union is most afraid of is “enosis” which could lead to the
                            presence of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>6. Under the circumstances we have instructed Belcher to emphasize to
                            Tuomioja that he should not put in a non-agreed report. If he feels it
                            necessary to make a report in the near future, he should simply state
                            his inability to reach an agreed solution and indicate his determination
                            to continue the effort. <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> is also
                            making the same representations to the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>7. Even if <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> goes along
                            with this formula, we shall face serious problems in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. There are only six weeks to go until the
                            present resolution runs out. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will use the occasion of the further extension
                            of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> in June to try to put
                            further hamstringing conditions on the use of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force. We shall have great difficulty getting the
                            members contributing forces to agree to supply further financial support
                            and we shall be hard put to scratch around and find the necessary money.
                            Troops will be difficult to hold and replacements even more difficult to
                            find. A number of countries will wish to withdraw their units and there
                            is a danger that the SYG will have to reach farther out to less
                            desirable suppliers. We shall have difficulty holding Tuomioja to a
                            longer term than the initial three months.</p>
                        <p>8. All of this confusion is made to order for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, who has already shown a
                            notable ability to do mischief in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.
                            He may make an effort to get a special meeting of the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> called in order to achieve an even
                            better forum.</p>
                        <p>9. Meanwhile time is not running on our side. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is getting in a mood of greater moroseness and
                            despondency and the Turk-Cypriots are capable of a kind of
                            Gotterdammerung psychology that could lead to a blow-up all over the
                            Island.</p>
                        <p>10. There seems to me only one sensible procedure and that is for the
                            Greek and Turkish Governments to move into the situation and take charge
                            of it. From Papandreou's talk with Fulbright and from other sources
                            there are indications of an increasing Greek Government disenchantment
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. I find
                            Papandreou's repeated references to “enosis” a healthy sign. From the
                            point of view of all of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, we should
                            regard “enosis” as a useful component in any final solution since it
                            would mean that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> government would
                            have charge of the Island rather than the wolf in priest's clothing.
                            Obviously, “enosis” would be possible only if some provision were made
                            for those Turk-Cypriots to leave who wanted to leave. In order to make
                            this palatable to the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> there would
                            have to be some kind of territorial concessions by Greece.</p>
                        <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0126"/>
                        <p>11. I doubt that there is much efficacy in trying to get <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> and Costopoulos together in The
                            Hague. But I do think that you might wish to have talks with some of the
                            other Foreign Ministers in order to prepare their minds for possible
                            joint pressure on both Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> directed at persuading them to take matters in
                            their own hands and work out an agreed solution somewhere down the line.
                            Papandreou seems confident that he can bring off “enosis” by providing
                            some kind of a plebiscite on the Island. While a Greek Cyprus would be
                            hard for the Turks it would certainly be better for their interests than
                            Cuba off their shores.</p>
                        <p>12. I have talked with both <persName corresp="#p_GSDOLH1">Harlech</persName> and Charles Ritchie about these matters and have
                            told them that I would suggest to you that you have some conversations
                            in this spirit with some of the other Ministers. I think you will find
                            both <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName> and Paul Martin
                            prepared for this.</p>
                        <p>13. Meanwhile you might suggest to some of the other Foreign Ministers
                            that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s role is to be
                            that of quiet mediator and that they should make this clear to him.
                            Nothing could be worse for our purposes than a report by the Mediator
                            that would give the initiative to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and drive the Turks into a greater sense of
                            isolation and despondency.</p>

                        <p>Secto 12. For the Acting Secretary. In my talk with Costopoulos this
                                morning<note n="2" xml:id="d42fn2">Telegram 1136, February 2,
                                reported on Cypriot student demonstrations against “<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> intervention” in Cyprus.
                                (Ibid.)</note> he said that he planned to make a statement this
                            afternoon on Cyprus which would call for a stronger <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in keeping the peace in Cyprus. I
                            have not seen an advance copy of his statement but will relay it as soon
                            as one is available. I asked him what President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would think about such a
                            stronger <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role and he replied “it
                            doesn't matter what President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> thinks about it.” There may be many hookers in

                            made but it might provide some leverage for further strengthening of

                            would reassure the Turks. I leave it to you to follow up with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if the Greek statement offers a further
                            handle to take hold of.<note n="3" xml:id="d42fn3">In the statement,
                                Costopoulos stressed the desire of the Greek Government to
                                contribute to a solution of the Cyprus problem that would provide
                                “Cypriots of Turkish origin” with every protection of law. He also
                                stated that Greece would support any U.N. body that would provide
                                long-term guarantees of the rights of Turkish Cypriots. The text of
                                Costopoulos' statement was transmitted in Secto 21, May 12.
                                (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Costopoulos confirmed that Greece considers the Treaty of Guarantee to be
                            still in effect but insisted that Article IV does not authorize
                            unilateral Turkish intervention. He offered to have this point
                            adjudicated. From Turkish point of view I would suppose adjudication
                            would be interpreted as an attempt to throw doubt on Turkish rights
                            during protracted period. On the other hand, it is just possible that
                            some form of general adjudication as to the continuing validity and
                            interpretation of the treaties might provide a means to put certain
                            prestige factors on ice for a period if adjudication were to be applied
                            to issues of interest to both sides. This is a very long shot but I
                            mention it for Department's consideration.</p>
                        <p>Reporting officer's account of my talk with <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> will be sent separately.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Transmitted in Secto 19, May 12. (Ibid.) A
                                memorandum of the conversation regarding Cyprus is ibid., Conference
                                Files: Lot 66 D 110, CF 2397.</note> After that conversation
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> drew me aside and
                            affirmed Inonu's interest in talks with Greek Government although there
                            seemed to be a strong implication that such talks would have to be on
                            the basis of recognizing the validity of existing treaties. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> then expressed dismay over the
                            prospect of a greatly deteriorating situation in Cyprus at the end of
                            the period of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> responsibility and said
                            that Turkey may be forced to intervene. He asked me whether, in that
                            event, the US will support Turkey. I reminded him that the President had
                            referred to intervention as a “last resort” but that, in any event, a
                            direct answer to his question could only be given by the President. I
                            said that situation would constitute no solution and would be the very
                            catastrophe which all of us should now work to prevent. I added that it
                            might be necessary for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces to
                            remain beyond the period of their initial engagement in order to
                            forestall the deterioration he feared. I did not get the impression that
                            he was warning me of imminent military action by Turkey.</p>

                        <p>1517. At informal family lunch today with only the Inonus, Metin Tokers
                            and ourselves present, for which invitation only extended yesterday and
                            which obviously intended to afford occasion discuss Cyprus, Inonu was
                            model of courtesy and hospitality but burden of his remarks constituted
                            heavy fare indeed.</p>
                        <p>Inonu began by saying everything had been tried to no avail and future
                            dark. He was at wits end to know where turn. As far as he knew
                            conversation of <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> with
                                Secretary<note n="2" xml:id="d43fn2">See the last paragraph of <ref target="#d42">Document 42</ref>.</note> had not brought out
                            anything new and Greeks opposing discussion Cyprus in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. It was dismal business. He
                            had done his best explain situation as seen here but still wondered if
                            Washington really understood. At times we had seemed lose interest. I
                            said that, referring first to his last comment, I could say Washington
                            did understand matter but action must of necessity be suited to
                            circumstance. If we had been less active for a time it had been in order
                            give <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> opportunity function effectively
                            but when its performance seemed lagging we had not hesitated renew
                            efforts.</p>
                        <p>Regarding what to do next, I said had always been my conviction that
                            mistake to think of Cyprus as just thing in itself and that closer
                            consultation in past between Ankara and Athens might have spared us much
                            of present grief. I realized that consultation now more difficult but,
                            difficult or not, it seemed necessary step in seeking solution. Could
                            Inonu tell me if Erkin might be seeing Greek FonMin in Hague?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said he too had always
                            favored direct talks with Athens and there had been some hope under
                            previous Greek govts but Papandreou had now elected identify himself
                            completely with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.
                            Talking with one would be same as talking with other. Regarding
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>, no reason why he
                            shouldn't talk with Greek counterpart but Greek officials very high and
                            mighty these days and didn't know whether would be possible.</p>
                        <p>I said all this seemed be getting nowhere and asked if <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> as man of great experience could
                            not identify certain areas where effort might be made break through
                            present barriers.</p>
                        <p>It was at this point that <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            delivered what he apparently intended be punch-line of conversation by
                            saying that time for persuasion <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0129"/>now passed; no longer any role for “the old statesman,” as matter now
                            stand there are only two alternatives, either submit to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> or beat some sense into his
                            head by force.</p>
                        <p>At this point we were called to lunch but afterward I asked what Inonu
                            meant by using force to bring <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to see reason. He said he meant military force;
                            it wouldn't be necessary to invade all of island, merely occupy part of
                            it. This was something Makarios could understand.</p>
                        <p>I said needless point out this would probably result in Greek
                            intervention, clash between Greek and Turkish forces and possible
                            escalation of conflict to full-scale war between Greece and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> replied decision would be up
                            to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> prepared in either contingency.</p>
                        <p>I observed that, if only possible think of matter in terms of surrender
                            or war, obvious that Turkey's friends could support neither but I had
                            gained different impression in conversation with Fulbright in which I
                            had understood Inonu to have endorsed idea of strengthening peacekeeping
                            function in order establish security which would in turn permit quiet
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said this correct and he
                            still felt that way but doubted it would work. Must look facts in face.
                            Service which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might render would be
                            to make Turkish determination clear to Athens.</p>
                        <p>I said this still opened no path toward solution and in this connection
                            questioned accuracy of <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s
                            assumption in equating <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and Papandreou so completely. Information available to me did not
                            indicate that situation so monolithic but rather that there were various
                            aspects which might be exploited to advantage with Athens if
                            communication could just be established. Furthermore there seemed to be
                            certain change in pattern of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' behavior recently which might be more
                            hopefully interpreted. Addressing himself to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> first, Inonu said he too had
                            noted certain recent changes but now clear from bitter experience that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is crafty schemer
                            and that such changes merely for tactical deception.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Athens he was also dubious but, if it wished make contribution,
                            it could announce clearly its recognition of validity of existing
                            treaties. If this done and given several years time eventual solution
                            could be worked out. Such an announcement would completely clear
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>Adverting again to our attitude, <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said he had been greatly troubled by apparent
                            falling off of our interest following Ball Mission and also by
                            persistent reports that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> favoring
                            enosis as solution. This now cleared up but he still felt Washington not
                            fully aware of depth of Turkish despair in finding road out of Cyprus
                            imbroglio and its determination to use force if necessary. If I could
                            convey this depth of feeling <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0130"/>to
                            Washington and it, in turn, could convince Athens our conversation would
                            have served useful purpose.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comments:</hi> As is usually case, much of foregoing
                            repetitive and even punch-line re time for persuasion being passed and
                            preparedness intervene by force was reformulation of standard theme.
                            However, when this latter evaluated in terms of emphasis on strategic
                            importance of Cyprus during Fulbright talks and of insistence that GOT
                            could not allow Cyprus slip away as had other coastal islands,
                            regardless of whether Cyprus became unitary state or devolved to Greece,
                            there would seem to be strong indication that policy decision has been
                            reached or is in making in accord with which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will insist on some form of Turkish presence on Cyprus
                            or right of custodianship as essential ingredient in any solution
                            involving abrogation of present treaties. As of now this is still
                            somewhat dim shape emerging from mist but its outline has seemed to have
                            become increasingly clear of late. If this correct and if—if such policy
                            rigidly held, it is obvious that certain mixes which have been
                            tentatively considered to meet Turkish requirements would no longer fill
                            bill. Admittedly, this still somewhat “iffy” but trend seems
                            increasingly strong.</p>
                        <p>In so saying I am also mindful that Inonu may have correctly assumed that
                            his remarks would be promptly reported to Hague as background for
                            discussions there. Even so, I should still hesitate to discount them on
                            that score, given Inonu's reputation for multiple purpose action.<note n="3" xml:id="d43fn3">In telegram 1563 from Ankara, May 26, Hare

                        <p>1722. 1. In rereading recent telegrams on Cyprus I have observed that
                            whereas serious thought is being given by us to an eventual solution <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0131"/>involving enosis as preferable to
                            “unfettered independence”, this possibility has been linked at time with
                            the suggestion of some kind of territorial concession to Turkey by
                            Greece. As has been reported from here, I consider that question of
                            territorial concession is out of the picture not only for Papandreou
                            govt but for any other Greek Govt. All Greek politicians, govt and
                            opposition, stand as one on this issue. It is difficult to envisage
                            Greek politicians being brought to agree to what could be termed a
                            partition of Greece when all are so dead set against a partition of
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>2. On the other hand, Papandreou and some other influential Greeks have
                            expressed their awareness of the importance of trying to find something
                            which might avoid or at least minimize feeling of “humiliation” on part
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, but none of them have been very
                            helpful in pointing way. Unfortunately, so long as the Greeks are
                            convinced that “justice” is on their side and that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will support their view of justice, there
                            is precious little initiative to be expected from them to date. The only
                            proposals to this end which Papandreou has advanced have been (a) his
                            suggestion that enosis would meet Turkey's security worries by having
                            Cyprus become part of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; (b) that a
                            formula be devised for continued <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            presence on island to ensure minority rights; (c) that adequate
                            compensation be paid to all Cypriots who wish to leave island; and (d)
                            that GOT be helped financially.</p>
                        <p>3. This would doubtless be considered cold fare by the Turks, even if an
                            enosis solution should include establishment of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base in Cyprus, manned in part by
                            Turkish soldiers. The only other thing which I believe to be in the
                            realm of realism so far as the Greeks are concerned relates to Greek
                            interests in Istanbul. The sacrificing of those interests, which is in
                            fact already going on, might help salve Turkish feelings as well as
                            providing ways of life for such of the non-rural Turk-Cypriot population
                            as may leave Cyprus. The Greeks would, in first instance, certainly
                            oppose a population move, but this would not be the determinant,
                            particularly as <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> can throw the Greek
                            population out at any time. Moreover, I believe that many Greeks are
                            already reconciled to elimination of the Greek community.</p>
                        <p>4. The removal of the Patriarchate would present much more serious
                            problem, but should not be ruled out if, in fact, it would help assuage
                            the Turks for loss of position in Cyprus and lead to settlement without
                            more bloodshed. One important politician not in the government has
                            suggested to me the possibility of establishing the island of Patmos as
                            sovereign seat of the Patriarchate, with cession of island by Greece and
                            adequate international financing to create proper facilities. A few
                            Greeks are privately talking of these terms, but this is highly
                            unpopular concept for most. Any settlement involving removal of
                            Patriarchate would have <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0132"/>to be
                            most carefully and quietly developed and suggestions should definitely
                            not come from us.</p>
                        <p>5. I recognize that foregoing does not meet <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> desiderata and may not greatly advance prospects of a
                            Cyprus solution. However, I feel it important that the Department
                            appreciate that in our view concession of territory to Turkey would not
                            be acceptable as element in any solution. Furthermore, in view of
                            increasing tensions within Center Union and strong nationalist line on
                            Cyprus taken by extreme left, it is doubtful whether Papandreou could
                            make any meaningful concession to Turks at this juncture.</p>

                                fighting. (Ibid.) Telegram 1254, May 20, reported that the issue of
                                hostages “has been brought to head” by the announcement that 74 of
                                the 91 Turkish Cypriots taken hostage by Greek Cypriots were
                                unaccounted for. The telegram outlined efforts of U.N. officials to
                                secure the release of the hostages. (Ibid.)</note> Dept agrees with
                            Emb Nicosia that increased hostage taking by Greek Cypriots, and
                            particularly likelihood that sizeable number those taken recent days are
                            dead, has serious implications for efforts restore law and order on
                            Cyprus and establish conditions under which rational efforts resolve
                            basic political problem could be undertaken. We fear that when news
                            breaks, as it doubtless will soon, that sizeable number of Turk Cypriots
                            abducted have been killed, Turk Cypriot forces in Cyprus may respond by
                            abducting and shooting Greek Cypriots or otherwise lashing out with acts
                            of violence. Hostage taking and executions also fodder for militant
                            elements Turkey and could stimulate further <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> moves against Greek community Istanbul and lead to
                            renewed threat of intervention.</p>
                        <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0133"/>
                        <p>To try head off or blunt these ominous possibilities, we believe would be
                            desirable for <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> call in Rossides and
                            Bitsios and impress on them serious view which he takes of abductions.
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> could launch his démarche by
                            stressing that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolutions March 4 and
                            11 call on all <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member states,
                            including GOC, take no action likely to worsen situation in Cyprus and
                            requests GOC in line its responsibilities for maintaining law and order
                            in Cyprus to take “all additional measures necessary” stop violence and
                            bloodshed. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> could state forthrightly
                            that large scale abductions which have thus far gone unpunished reflect
                            clear failure GOC live up to its responsibilities under resolutions.</p>
                        <p>Since we could not be sure Rossides would faithfully reflect seriousness
                            of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> démarche, we believe it would be
                            extremely important that Thant impress on Bitsios grave implications of
                            hostage taking and probable killing of hostages. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> could emphasize to Bitsios that, given support for
                            Greek Cypriots by GOG, abductions and probable killings can only lead to
                            further deterioration in Greco-Turkish relations and play into hands
                            militant elements on all sides. We would hope Bitsios would get message
                            and that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would in turn drive home to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that abductions
                            must cease and that hostages still living must be released.</p>
                        <p>As Galo Plaza will presumably be returning Cyprus next few days,<note n="3" xml:id="d45fn3">On May 11, Secretary-General Thant informed
                                the Security Council that Galo Plaza was going to Cyprus as his

                            Nicosia 1254, that GOC has obligation to take whatever steps necessary
                            prevent further abductions. Message might refer to reports that some or
                            all those abducted have been executed, and ask that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> effect release of hostages
                            still in hands Greek Cypriots. In light <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> sensitivity foreign criticism and his vanity re
                            personal image, such message might infer that, unless <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> acts, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> may feel compelled make public statement condemning
                            abductions.</p>
                        <p>You requested suggest foregoing course either directly to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> or through Bunche and urge that <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> act upon it while Galo Plaza in New
                            York. Suggest you indicate we find abductions and potential trouble
                            stemming therefrom particularly disquieting since through efforts of
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> number and scale of
                            incidents has been significantly reduced and gratifying progress being

                            meetings with Rossides and Bitsios; in case of former to ensure that
                            Cyprus Rep does not attempt gloss over this serious matter, and with
                            Bitsios to put in perspective seriousness abduction problem for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping effort and work of mediator.
                            We have been impressed by Galo Plaza's quick grasp of Cyprus situation.

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_VJ1">Jack</persName>: </p>
                        <p>The Greek Cypriot leaders have made clear they intend to use the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a forum to press their case both in
                            the Security Council in June and in the General Assembly in the autumn,
                            by which time they expect <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s mediation efforts will have failed. They
                            expect to have adequate support not only to get the item on the agenda
                            but also to secure endorsement of the general principles they espouse:
                            an independent, unitary state; majority control; minority safeguards;
                            right of self-determination. If this is secured, they will proceed, with
                            or without Turkish Cypriot cooperation, to draw up a new constitution,
                            have it endorsed by plebiscite, and implement it.</p>
                        <p>The Cyprus problem would remain, but in an altered state. The Greek
                            Cypriots would have international moral endorsement of their efforts
                            along the above lines, and conversely, justification for continued
                            Turkish Cypriot legalistic opposition to these efforts would be thrown
                            into doubt, particularly if convincing security guarantees were
                            provided.</p>
                        <p>It appears inevitable that the GOC will seek General Assembly endorsement
                            of the above principles, which underlie our own system and which command
                            the obvious dedication of the overwhelming majority of the Cyprus
                            population. The vote on some such resolution will obviously pose a
                            difficult problem for the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. The
                            Soviet Union and East Europeans will have no such scruples as we and can
                            pose as the “true supporters of democracy” unless we can find some way
                            to appear <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0135"/>on the positive side of
                            the debate and the vote. While recognizing the very difficult problem
                            this may pose vis-à-vis Ankara, we believe it would be harmful to our
                            overall interests here and elsewhere for the US to oppose such a
                            resolution or abstain. To prepare for this likely eventuality, we
                            believe the United States should commence now to plan a policy evolution
                            which would permit positive endorsement rather than awkward abstention.
                            It might be well for us to coordinate such an effort with the British,
                            who will presumably be in a similar position at the General Assembly
                            because of the need to protect their Sovereign Base Areas.</p>
                        <p>I realize this will have to be undertaken with considerable finesse in
                            view of the assurances given <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> that the United States will exert maximum effort
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and among the parties concerned
                            to see that justice is done and that Turkey does not suffer humiliation.
                            The obvious problem here is the interpretation of what constitutes
                            “humiliation.” The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> can be expected
                            to interpret this as broadly as possible. For our part, I believe we
                            should from the first make clear that the key word is justice, and in
                            our view a just solution must accord with the political facts of the
                            situation in Cyprus. In this context, we should exert our maximum
                            efforts to see that the wording, specific details and manner of
                            presentation of any specific proposals are such as to avoid offense or
                            humiliation to the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Aside from the
                            proceedings at an early Security Council meeting, I have in mind of
                            course, the probability that Tuomioja will, as a minimum, make a report
                            of his views on settlement to U Thant. As suggested in my tel 1235 to
                            the Department,<note n="2" xml:id="d46fn2">Telegram 1235 from Nicosia,
                                May 14, reported Tuomoija's views of the likely contents of his
                                report to the Secretary-General. (Ibid.)</note> the use of his
                            report by SYG is something we would want to influence.</p>
                        <p>Aside from considerations of face, the principal fears of both the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and the Turkish Cypriot Community
                            appear to revolve around the question of security. To win even reluctant
                            Turkish acquiescence to a Cyprus solution, some promise of security must
                            be held out to Turkish Cypriots and Turks alike. Specific discussion of
                            ways to cope with Turkish Cypriot and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> security problems would demonstrate our appreciation of
                            their legitimate concern in this area and should at the same time lead
                            their thinking into more productive and realistic examination of
                            practical problems rather than the present immobilism of extreme and
                            adamant positions which ignore the political, economic and arithmetical
                            realities of this Island.</p>

                            unnoticed and believe best course would be to suggest SYG at least issue
                            strong statement condemning not only GOC and Turkish Cypriots for action
                            in attempting build up forces at this time, but also condemning those
                            nations which furnish arms.</p>
                        <p>In practical terms, however, we doubt he would get far with such an
                            “appeal”. (<persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> tells me he has
                            urged <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> go further, having placed arms
                            control question at top priority. He says Plaza agrees and will pre-sent
                            forceful case to U Thant.) In first place, smuggling can probably
                            continue largely undetected. Secondly, GOC is apt to argue that as legal
                            government it has authority and responsibility to secure arms needed for
                            national defense. We expect they may put this argument in connection
                            with demand that SC resolution not only instruct <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> to help GOC put down
                            “rebellion”, but also state <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            will be used to defend Cyprus in case Turkish “aggression” unless, of
                            course, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will give further guarantee
                            of no intervention while <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            here. When <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> does not comply, GOC will
                            probably cite lack of guarantee against Turkish intervention as
                            justification for continued arms acquisition.</p>
                        <p>Of course, arms acquired under this rubric can also be used against
                            Turkish Cypriots. Swedish Charge Bundy fears this is real purpose of
                            armaments and believes problem cannot be ignored by <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>In connection with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration of
                            arms problem, GOC is certain to raise question of Turkish clandestine
                            arms and personnel shipments through Mansoura-Kokkina area, west of
                            Morphou Bay area. Minister of Labour <persName corresp="#p_PT1">Papadopoulos</persName> told me yesterday that GOC was about to
                            insist <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss> do something to stop
                            smuggling or GOC would be forced to take action. Said both arms and men
                            coming in from Turkey in increasing numbers and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> unable or unwilling to stop. I pointed out <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts to stop it would mean clash with
                            Turkish Cypriot fighter groups and I doubted Swedish contingent would
                            take such action. (Swedish Charge later confirmed this.)
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> was insistent GOC could not permit
                            traffic to continue. He went on to say that Minister of Interior
                            Georkadjis had documentary evidence of complicity Turkish Ambassador in
                            smuggling arrangements and that this might be used in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> proceedings.</p>
                        <p>Despite these complicating factors, I do not see how we can sit idly by
                            and take no notice of GOC plans to exacerbate situation with extensive
                            arms purchases. Therefore, come what may, we should urge <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> to make representations GOC, as well as
                            to Greece and Turkey, to cooperate in stopping arms race on island.
                            Naturally, appeal should be addressed to other nations as well, and if
                            additional, usable information re UAR and Soviet implication in deals
                            can be developed, statement can be directed at them specifically.
                            (Eventually, of course, as equipment begins arrive, source will be
                            obvious.)</p>
                        <p>We might also consider utility of requesting <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> embargo on arms to island as in keeping with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution of March 4. This would
                            embarrass Greece and Turkey, but would at least dry up certain other
                            sources. In this connection, Israeli Ambassador says there is blanket
                            prohibition by his government.</p>
                        <p>Have also spoken to British HICOMer Bishop and Finnish Charge Kawin, both
                            of whom have sent strong reports their governments along foregoing
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>All this is something which can be discussed with Plaza in New York on
                            his return from Quito.<note n="3" xml:id="d47fn3">Topol 1822 to Paris,

                            <placeName>Nicosia</placeName>, <date when="1964-05-28T18:00:00">May 28,
                                1964, 6 p.m.</date>
                        </dateline>
                        <p>1282. During call on President made at my request, following observations
                            worth reporting:</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting. GOC will favor three months'
                            extension of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> and, despite
                            rumors to contrary appearing in press will request no changes in terms
                            of reference. (Min Labour told me later this latter point still not
                            finalized.) Possibly due to recent unfortunate incidents involving
                            individual British soldiers as well as considerable anti-British feeling
                            current on island, GOC may request reduction in number <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> soldiers in <gloss target="#t_PKF1">PKF</gloss>. President has hopes that by concentrating British
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops in Limassol and Larnaca
                            areas where situation much more [<hi rend="italic">worse</hi>?] than
                            elsewhere any further incidents can be avoided.</p>
                        <p>2. Arms procurement and conscription. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said reports of GOC plans to obtain arms
                            grossly exaggerated in press. Obviously GOC has no need for “heavy
                            bombers, etc.” He had need, however, for fast patrol vessels, but so far
                            was unable to obtain torpedo boats by purchase in West; therefore might
                            have to turn to Soviets. Pointed out that he had now five planes in Air
                            Force, including two helicopters. Said “all but one are yours, none are
                            from the Soviet.” (This confirmed in previous reports from Embassy and
                            ARMA.) We did not discuss possibility of jet fighters or
                            already-reported arrivals of light arms. With regard to conscription
                            bill, President said that bill basically designed to establish control
                            and discipline and would incorporate and break up various private groups
                            such as Lyssarides' and Sampson's under over-all control of General
                            Karayannis. Training program would include initially 16,000, but present
                            plans did not provide for eventual army of anything like that size.</p>
                        <p>Said they had considered expanding police force, but had rejected this as
                            being more expensive than creating small standing army. Said he had in
                            mind force of 3,000 to 5,000, but this might be somewhat larger, perhaps
                            as high as 8,000, and hoped that there would be no need for more in
                            order control situation here vis-à-vis Turkish Cypriots. When I
                            mentioned hostage problem and my encouragement at recent editorials
                            calling on Greek Cypriots to use restraint and not take vengeance on
                            innocent people, Archbishop said he had instigated press items and added
                            further strong condemnation such acts. Said he hoped conscription and
                            new armed forces would put stop to such irresponsibility. Noted also
                            that no further acts committed since his appeal. Added that<pb n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0139"/> Red Cross had now found another 30 of
                            those allegedly taken prior to May 11 incidents in Famagust. Said he had
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> to issue statement
                            on 30, but reply negative and he now would put matter on public record.
                            (We checking this out with <gloss target="#t_ICRC1">ICRC</gloss>
                            reps.)</p>
                        <p>3. Apparent growth of Soviet influence. I said we could understand GOC
                            looking with favor on Soviet offers of assistance when country
                            apparently in danger. However, I recalled that on previous occasion he
                            had said that basic orientation of GOC and majority of people of Cyprus
                            was and would remain with West.</p>
                        <p>Bearing this in mind, I said number of recent developments appeared to be
                            pointing in other direction: Aside from arms question, there had been
                            Aeroflot agreement, recently completed temporary air agreement with East
                            Germany, establishment here of Cuban Mission, and possibility that
                            Soviet petroleum products would be entering island through contract with
                            electricity authority. President said he considered these were minor
                            developments, and he could assure me that he would continue to act with
                            utmost caution re possible entanglements with USSR. (This obviously
                            means one thing to him and another to us.) With regard to Cuba, he gave
                            me same argument as FonMin (previously reported) and he described air
                            agreements as of little significance except that he was hopeful that
                            East German agreement might possibly involve development in tourism. He
                            said he was hopeful that contract for electricity authority would go to
                            already established private firm here, but he thought it would be
                            difficult to exclude low bidding firm simply on basis that their source
                            of supply was Soviet Union. (It was apparent that he was reluctant to
                            see electricity authority used as means to introduce sizable amounts of
                            Soviet petroleum products, but he was at loss to see just how this might
                            be prevented except perhaps through interpretation of bids based on
                            price, experience and service.)</p>
                        <p>4. Easing of tensions in Nicosia. President said that in discussions
                            yesterday with UNFICYP POLAD Flores re withdrawal of Greek and Turkish
                            Cypriot positions from demarcations along Green Line, he (Markarios) had
                            made radical proposal as follows: instead of 100-yard withdrawal by each
                            side, if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would take over several posts
                            which he had designated on map, Greek Cypriots would dismantle all their
                            positions. I said this was most encouraging development and expressed
                            hope it would work out. President said he did not see how Turks could
                            refuse <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> offer to take over their posts
                            as long as Greek side withdrew completely. (We shall follow this up with
                            Flores.)</p>
                        <p>Our meeting was in private, extremely cordial and it was agreed we should
                            meet at least every fortnight for general discussion.</p>

                        <p>885. We seem to detect just the beginnings of thinking in both Athens and
                            Ankara that a territorial quid pro quo might be an ingredient in an

                            for not having been sufficiently active and Turk cause lost unless two

                            situation on island very critical and Cabinet meeting at 8:30 (local
                            time) tonight to decide what to do. I asked if intervention might be
                            decided. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said that
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>I then said it was understandable but definite instructions warn most
                            seriously against intervention and I gave reasons, adding that I had
                            also been somewhat encouraged recently by reports from Athens indicating
                                <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0142"/>Papandreou was pondering

                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said he had heard nothing
                            of more encouraging nature from Athens but, if there was anything firm,
                            it could have important effect on decision of Cabinet tonight and he
                            would endeavor postpone meeting for an hour in order to afford
                            opportunity for us to communicate anything which we might have.</p>
                        <p>I then asked what <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> meant by
                            indicating agreement that we and British should have been more diligent.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said support in Athens
                            of Turkish demand for federation or “double enosis.” This essential and
                            such ideas as exchange of population or giving Turks “some small island”
                            out of question.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> also said he had thought
                            our attitude toward enosis had been clarified in Washington but he
                            alleged have information that American official sources in Nicosia were
                            in fact stating enosis was our approved policy.</p>
                        <p>Hope you or Athens can give me something urgently which I can convey to
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> in effort deter
                            precipitate action.</p>
                        <p>On leaving FonOff I by chance ran into Inonu and approached him in
                            similar manner but <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            apparently got wind that we were talking and joined us to say he had
                            explained situation to me and would fill in Inonu. I told him make sure
                            stress gravity our concern of intervention contemplated. He said he
                            would.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary apologized for taking up a matter over the telephone with
                            the Ambassador but since time was of the essence he was taking the
                            liberty to do so. He said that the President had asked him to call the
                            Ambassador most urgently and say that the President is gravely concerned
                            by a statement which the Foreign Minister made to our Ambassador to the
                            effect that a cabinet meeting was scheduled for approximately 8:30 p.m.
                            at which the question of intervention in Cyprus could be decided. We
                            have considered we have had a flat assurance through the Foreign
                            Minister such a step would not be taken and that there would be full
                            consultation with allies. We would find this a very, very grave
                            departure from our understandings and would have a serious effect on the
                            problem of our security commitments with our allies. The President asked
                            most urgently that we urge in the gravest terms that we have an
                            opportunity for consultations on these matters.</p>
                        <p>The Turkish Ambassador responded that it was very difficult for him to
                            get through quickly to Ankara and asked if the Secretary was also
                            sending a message to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName>. The Secretary replied in the affirmative, adding
                            that he was requesting the Ambassador to exert every effort as
                                well.<note n="2" xml:id="d51fn2">Telegram 1285 to Ankara, June 4,

                        <p>2. Required action for moment seems to me is for Turks to tell Kucuk
                            firmly not to attempt establish de facto partition. I must emphasize
                            that if Turks move to intervene on island, Greeks will react promptly

                        <p>1598. Have just completed three hour conversation with Inonu while
                            Cabinet waited. From start it was made clear that decision firm as far
                            as Inonu concerned. Only thing wanted from us was understanding attitude
                            on grounds that purpose was to move into only part of island as only way
                            to reduce problem to manageable proportions. We would see and agree once
                            operation carried out. Argument was tough and sometimes got on very
                            sensitive ground with Inonu holding ground firmly and saying not only
                            Cyprus but our relationship could hinge on agreement with Turkish
                            decision. When Inonu made another move to join Cabinet I said was
                            certain what I had been told would be great disappointment to President
                            who has stressed importance of consultation and was only being given
                            opportunity to agree or disagree on single proposition. This could
                            hardly be called consultation.</p>

                            as planned would cause great let down and results could be disastrous.
                            Why hadn't we put questions which could be answered? What would I
                            suggest?</p>
                        <p>I said what we needed was time make our views known. <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> asked how much time. I said
                            twenty-four hours in belief that request for longer delay would be
                            refused. Inonu agreed, saying would be difficult call off plans at this
                            stage but that he would do so. He must however stress importance of
                            strict secrecy. This I assured. Longer tel follows<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2">Telegram 1599 from Ankara, June 5. (Ibid.)</note>

                            following message from President:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I am gravely concerned by the information which I have had through
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> from you and your
                            Foreign Minister that the Turkish Government is contemplating a decision
                            to intervene by military force to occupy a portion of Cyprus. I wish to
                            emphasize, in the fullest friendship and frankness, that I do not
                            consider that such a course of action by Turkey, fraught with such
                            far-reaching consequences, is consistent with the commitment of your
                            Government to consult fully in advance with us. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> has indicated that you have
                            postponed your decision for a few hours in order to obtain my views. I
                            put to you personally whether you really believe that it is appropriate
                            for your <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0146"/>Government, in effect,
                            to present an ultimatum to an ally who has demonstrated such staunch
                            support over the years as has the United States for Turkey. I must,
                            therefore, first urge you to accept the responsibility for complete
                            consultation with the United States before any such action is taken.</p>
                        <p>It is my impression that you believe that such intervention by Turkey is
                            permissible under the provisions of the Treaty of Guarantee of 1960. I
                            must call your attention, however, to our understanding that the
                            proposed intervention by Turkey would be for the purpose of supporting
                            an attempt by Turkish Cypriot leaders to partition the Island, a
                            solution which is specifically excluded by the Treaty of Guarantee.
                            Further, that Treaty requires consultation among the Guarantor Powers.
                            It is the view of the United States that the possibilities of such
                            consultation have by no means been exhausted in this situation and that,
                            therefore, the reservation of the right to take unilateral action is not
                            yet applicable.</p>
                        <p>I must call to your attention, also, Mr. Prime Minister, the obligations
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. There can be no question in
                            your mind that a Turkish intervention in Cyprus would lead to a military
                            engagement between Turkish and Greek forces. Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> declared at the recent
                            meeting of the Ministerial Council of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in The Hague that war between Turkey and Greece must
                            be considered as ‘literally unthinkable.’<note n="2" xml:id="d54fn2">For
                                text of the May 12 statement, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, June 1, 1964, pp. 850–852.</note>
                            Adhesion to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, in its very essence,
                            means that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries will not wage
                            war on each other. Germany and France have buried centuries of animosity
                            and hostility in becoming <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies;
                            nothing less can be expected from Greece and Turkey. Furthermore, a
                            military intervention in Cyprus by Turkey could lead to a direct
                            involvement by the Soviet Union. I hope you will understand that your
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies have not had a chance
                            to consider whether they have an obligation to protect Turkey against
                            the Soviet Union if Turkey takes a step which results in Soviet
                            intervention without the full consent and understanding of its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies.</p>
                        <p>Further, Mr. Prime Minister, I am concerned about the obligations of
                            Turkey as a member of the United Nations. The United Nations has
                            provided forces on the Island to keep the peace. Their task has been
                            difficult but, during the past several weeks, they have been
                            progressively successful in reducing the incidents of violence on that
                            Island. The United Nations Mediator has not yet completed his work. I
                            have no doubt that the general membership of the United Nations would
                            react in the strongest terms to unilateral action by Turkey which would
                            defy the efforts of the United Nations and destroy any prospect that the
                            United Nations <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0147"/>could assist in
                            obtaining a reasonable and peaceful settlement of this difficult
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>I wish also, Mr. Prime Minister, to call your attention to the bilateral
                            agreement between the United States and Turkey in the field of military
                            assistance. Under Article IV of the Agreement with Turkey of July
                                1947,<note n="3" xml:id="d54fn3">For text of the agreement on
                                economic and technical cooperation, signed in Ankara on July 12,
                                1947, and entered into force the same day, see 61 Stat. 2953.</note>
                            your Government is required to obtain United States consent for the use
                            of military assistance for purposes other than those for which such
                            assistance was furnished. Your Government has on several occasions
                            acknowledged to the United States that you fully understand this
                            condition. I must tell you in all candor that the United States cannot
                            agree to the use of any United States supplied military equipment for a
                            Turkish intervention in Cyprus under present circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Moving to the practical results of the contemplated Turkish move, I feel
                            obligated to call to your attention in the most friendly fashion the
                            fact that such a Turkish move could lead to the slaughter of tens of
                            thousands of Turkish Cypriots on the Island of Cyprus. Such an action on
                            your part would unleash the furies and there is no way by which military
                            action on your part could be sufficiently effective to prevent wholesale
                            destruction of many of those whom you are trying to protect. The
                            presence of United Nations forces could not prevent such a
                            catastrophe.</p>
                        <p>You may consider that what I have said is much too severe and that we are
                            disregardful of Turkish interests in the Cyprus situation. I should like
                            to assure you that this is not the case. We have exerted ourselves both
                            publicly and privately to assure the safety of Turkish Cypriots and to
                            insist that a final solution of the Cyprus problem should rest upon the
                            consent of the parties most directly concerned. It is possible that you
                            feel in Ankara that the United States has not been sufficiently active
                            in your behalf. But surely you know that our policy has caused the
                            liveliest resentments in Athens (where demonstrations have been aimed
                            against us) and has led to a basic alienation between the United States
                            and Archbishop Makarios. As I said to your Foreign Minister in our
                            conversation just a few weeks ago,<note n="4" xml:id="d54fn4">See <ref target="#d37">Document 37</ref>.</note> we value very highly our
                            relations with Turkey. We have considered you as a great ally with
                            fundamental common interests. Your security and prosperity have been a
                            deep concern of the American people and we have expressed that concern
                            in the most practical terms. You and we have fought together to resist
                            the ambitions of the communist world revolution. This solidarity has
                            meant a great deal to us and I would hope that it means a great deal to
                            your Government and to your people. We have no intention of lending any
                            support to any solution of Cyprus which endangers the Turkish Cypriot
                            community. We have not been able to find a final solution because this
                            is, admittedly, one of the <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0148"/>most
                            complex problems on earth. But I wish to assure you that we have been
                            deeply concerned about the interests of Turkey and of the Turkish
                            Cypriots and will remain so.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. Prime Minister I must tell you that you have posed the
                            gravest issues of war and peace. These are issues which go far beyond
                            the bilateral relations between Turkey and the United States. They not
                            only will certainly involve war between Turkey and Greece but could
                            involve wider hostilities because of the unpredictable consequences
                            which a unilateral intervention in Cyprus could produce. You have your
                            responsibilities as Chief of the Government of Turkey; I also have mine
                            as President of the United States. I must, therefore, inform you in the
                            deepest friendship that unless I can have your assurance that you will
                            not take such action without further and fullest consultation I cannot
                            accept your injunction to Ambassador Hare of secrecy and must
                            immediately ask for emergency meetings of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council and of the United Nations Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>I wish it were possible for us to have a personal discussion of this
                            situation. Unfortunately, because of the special circumstances of our
                            present Constitutional position, I am not able to leave the United
                            States. If you could come here for a full discussion I would welcome it.
                            I do feel that you and I carry a very heavy responsibility for the
                            general peace and for the possibilities of a sane and peaceful
                            resolution of the Cyprus problem. I ask you, therefore, to delay any
                            decisions which you and your colleagues might have in mind until you and
                            I have had the fullest and frankest consultation.</p>

                            impasse is not yet clear, but in either case we should seize resulting
                            situation as opportunity to be exploited to fullest in effort achieve
                            lasting settlement.</p>

                            essential we keep eye on political, economic and demographic facts of
                            life and avoid being drawn into quid pro quo with Turks which would
                            involve our support of a Turk Cypriot solution in exchange for their
                            agreement not to intervene.</p>
                        <p>June 5 exercise in Ankara may have been designed in part to take
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> off hook politically and
                            shift blame for Turkish inaction to us. In itself, this is not bad. We
                            can accept that onus, but we must be wary of dangers of going beyond
                            this possibly becoming involved in support of an unrealistic plan for
                            federation or in giving some general assurance of support which could be
                            interpreted as guaranteeing Turkish satisfaction in Cyprus.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has called for us to become
                            substantively involved. In so doing we must play it straight with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, pulling no punches in our analysis
                            that the facts clearly require an essentially Greek solution, that
                            partition or federation is anathema to 80 percent of population and
                            therefore politically and practically infeasible, and that the prime
                            problem will be to devise arrangements to give maximum protection to
                            Turk Cypriot and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> security interests.
                            This is moment to grasp nettle and tell GOT plainly we believe security
                            interests would best be insured by association of Cyprus with Greece—a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ally, a more mature and
                            responsible state, and one whose interests are in no way served by
                            perpetuation of difficulties with Turkey.</p>
                        <p>We can no longer remain on sidelines, expressing hope for solution
                            satisfactory to both sides. There is no such solution. Unitary,
                            Greek-run <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0151"/>state, closely
                            associated with Greece (perhaps with defense, foreign affairs and
                            guarantees of minority rights left in hands of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>) would offer following palpable advantages:</p>
                        <p>1. It should be acceptable to majority of Cyprus population.</p>
                        <p>2. It would allow us at least in Security Council and elsewhere to
                            displace solution as defender of justice on Cyprus (c.f. my letter to
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>), thus stemming
                            dangerous slide to the left here.</p>
                        <p>3. It would provide best guarantee available for security both of Turk
                            Cypriots and Turkey, bringing island within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> sphere and removing motive for further equivocating
                            GOC role re East and West which has so encouraged growth of Communist
                            influence on island.</p>
                        <p>4. It should contribute to improvement of Greek-Turkish relations, as
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would have every reason to
                            assure Turk Cypriot rights and reestablishment law and order on Cyprus.
                            Partition, federation or hermaphrodite London-Zurich type solution would
                            only guarantee continuing trouble on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Would seem that situation resulting from most recent crisis gives
                            opportunity for new initiative in effort end once and for all this
                            problem so fraught with danger to US and our allies, not to mention
                            people of Cyprus.</p>

                                Embassy to urge the Greek Government to relieve pressures in the
                                region through action with the Greek Cypriots and gestures toward
                                Turkey. (Ibid.) Telegram 1456 to Athens, June 5, instructed the
                                Embassy to urge Papandreou to press <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> for some concessions toward the Turkish
                                Cypriot community in order to reduce tensions. (Ibid.) Telegram
                                1464, June 6, instructed the Embassy to reiterate that the United
                                States had less leverage with Turkey after restraining it and urge
                                that Greece take concrete actions to lower levels of tension.
                                (Ibid.)</note> I started by saying the events were causing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to play more active role in Cyprus
                            matter, observing that Turks wanted this and I understood <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> and Greeks also did, provided
                            this done within framework <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. We wanted
                            to be helpful but needed help from parties themselves—and particularly
                            Greeks and we must work closely together in finding way out of morass. I
                            then made entirely clear how deeply concerned we were about recent
                            developments, and stressed once more deadly seriousness situation to
                            Greeks as well as to Cyprus and West. I recognized that, for political
                            reasons, Papandreou felt himself in difficult position to oppose
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> publicly at this
                            time, but pointed out that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>'s open
                            support of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> coupled with
                            such things as its failure publicly to protest at time of Saint Hilarion
                            and in connection with hostages following Famagusta had left bad
                            impression and that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> seemed justified
                            in assuming <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> calling
                            tune and Greece willingly following. It was therefore most important
                            that something be done which would indicate an atmosphere of
                            reasonableness on part of Greek Govt. I mentioned possibility of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> influencing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to have talks with Kucuk,
                            delay in introducing conscription, and suspend reported importation
                            heavy armaments.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> expressed great
                            appreciation for what <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had done. When
                            I said this wasn't the point, he replied that Greece would like to do
                            something to help, but Turks made it very difficult. Latest Turkish
                            threats were justification for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' worries and his actions. However, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> assured me Greeks had urged
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to talk with
                            Kucuk—not under conditions set by Kucuk but just to have general
                            discussion. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had
                            refused, saying it would serve no purpose with Kucuk and Turk Cypriots
                            in present frame of mind.</p>
                        <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0153"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> then referred to
                            alleged heavy armaments imports and assured me that as of present time
                            no deals had been made and the main thing Cypriots wanted was torpedo
                            boats (“possibly three”). He believed Cypriots would stop at that and we
                            could pass this on confidentially, but he added he could not guarantee
                            what <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> might do in
                            future. He shied away from conscription issue. He then referred to an
                            earlier conversation and said Cuba not setting up establishment in
                            Nicosia.</p>
                        <p>3. Concerning the current Turkish threat, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> was of two minds. I believe he understands
                            seriousness of situation, but he also harbors theories re <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> motivations which have somewhat
                            offsetting effect. In first place, he believes—as do many Greeks—threat
                            was timed for Senatorial elections—“it would not be first time they have
                            done this.”</p>
                        <p>But in his opinion, even more important motivation was probably related
                            to Turks' “spoiled child” complex in which they seek to obtain
                            concessions from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to support <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> in return for latter's better behavior.
                            I acknowledge that these might be factors in matter, but that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be making frightful error in
                            judgment if it underestimated Turkish feelings and deadly reality of
                            Greece's danger. It was only President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s very strong message and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s statesmanship that had saved
                            terrible catastrophe so far. I spoke of Inonou's internal problems and
                            repeated need to find some way of preventing Turkish humiliations. I
                            also strongly urged that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> caution
                            press against playing “bluff” theme it has used in past. He said he
                            agreed with what I had said: his govt has been trying to influence
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> along reasonable
                            lines but there was not much it could effectively do in
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> reverted to my
                            remark about internal political considerations curtailing Papanderou's
                            freedom of action re Cyprus. He said this was entirely true but was only
                            part of story. More important was fact that if <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> did not go along publicly with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, then game might well be lost
                            to the Soviets who were smartly supporting nationalistic aspirations,
                            both here and in Cyprus. Situation was becoming more and more dangerous
                            and only choice was between “a Mediterranean Cuba and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>” (i.e. enosis). There was no hope of
                            handling the Communist threat through partition or federation. This
                            would only aggravate matters and play into hands of Communists. It was
                            much better for Turkey's security interests, as well as for Greece and
                            Cyprus, to have Cyprus part of Greece with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base and with “Greek Govt monarch rather than someone
                            like Lysarrides or worse in control.” Latter was only realistic
                            alternative to enosis.<note n="3" xml:id="d57fn3">In telegram 1845 from
                                Athens, June 8, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName>
                                reported that based on his talk with <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> and others he believed that a limited
                                possibility of a Greek-Turkish accord based on enosis and a strictly
                                controlled Turkish base on Cyprus existed. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0154"/>
                        <p>5. I said it would be very difficult for <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Turks to swallow such a proposal and pressed
                            again for some other Greek suggestions. He acknowledged problem, but
                            repeated there was only one sensible and effective solution in Western
                            interests. It was useless to expect Greece to cede territory to Turkey
                            to achieve this end. He did volunteer, however, that a population
                            movement might be possible, although he asserted that movement of Greek
                            population and of Patriarchate from Istanbul would cause extreme agonies
                            for Greek people and it was possible that no govt could approve it.</p>
                        <p>6. I again asked about possibility of talks between Greeks and Turks to
                            which <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> replied that
                            talks between Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            or between him and <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> should
                            not be held without proper preparation. On his return from The Hague, he
                            had suggested to Papandreou that Greek and Turk Ambassadors meet in some
                            unspecified spot for discussions but Papandreou had turned this down at
                            the time. I obtained impression that there was possibility of making
                            some headway on this front and I shall continue probing.<note n="4" xml:id="d57fn4">In telegram 1851, June 10, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> reported that the Greeks
                                were ready to begin secret Ambassadorial-level discussions with
                                Turkey. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. It came out during talk that Greeks believe that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> leaning toward Greek concept
                            of satisfactory solution. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> had received report that <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> opposed to <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> filing report of his own views
                            with Security Council. He asked if this was <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position. I replied in the affirmative, saying that I
                            understood <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s job that of
                            a mediator and that if he could not find agreed solution, he should keep
                            on trying and should not come out with a personal opinion favoring one
                            extreme or the other; this could only serve to cause trouble at this
                            juncture.</p>
                        <p>8. At end, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said that
                            Greece had been informed during day (Sunday) that Kucuk was about to
                            assert sovereignty over certain areas of Cyprus in expectation that
                            Turkey (and possibly Pakistan and Iran) would support his action by some
                            sort of recognition. His intelligence was that this would take place
                            during <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s absence in the
                            States—probably in next couple of days. I said we had heard rumors about
                            possible Kucuk action few days ago and this had given rise to some of
                            our concern. I hoped new rumors were just old ones catching up.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said that Greek
                            Cypriots would have to react forcefully against Turkish Cypriots if
                            Kucuk took such action. I strongly urged that in any such event <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> should use every possible influence to
                            have <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> refer matter to
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> without resorting to force. He
                            agreed and was to talk to <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> about it.</p>

                                Ambassador to stress U.S. concern regarding plans for British troop
                                reductions in Cyprus. (Ibid.)</note> In as much as Under Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> did not have opportunity
                            raise subject of reftel with British during his crowded visit to London,
                            Jernegan, <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> and Eilts raised
                            it today with Dodson (Counselor, Central Dept) and <persName corresp="#p_WC1">Wood</persName> of FonOff. We stressed that while
                            appreciating great difficulties under which British soldiers are
                            laboring in Cyprus, US is convinced that British element in <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss> is key to success of peacekeeping
                            effort. Any suggestion therefore of reduction of size British component
                            creates greatest misgivings in US. We believe 7,000 man <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss> needed to carry out mission and are
                            concerned that <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss> troop strength is
                            slipping below this minimum level.</p>
                        <p> Dodson said HMG is operating on premise that <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss> is essential to peace of Eastern Mediterranean and
                            acknowledged that British element is major factor therein. Same time HMG
                            has been concerned about treatment meted out to British troops by
                            Cypriots and at suggestion that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> may attempt blackball further British military
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss>. In this
                            connection, he cited Georgatizis statement following arrest of RAF
                            Airman Marley that latter's activities called into question further
                            utility of British element in <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss>,
                            and more recent comment of <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss> that GOC has not yet decided
                            whether British should remain in <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss>. Dodson pointed out HMG would not wish public rebuff by
                            GOC re British participation.</p>
                        <p> Dodson said British element is now some 1800 strong. He claimed
                            reduction of British element has in past been geared into availability
                            other units from elsewhere. He said HMG has now taken policy decision
                            that it is willing to continue in <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss>, but for tactical reasons connected with its
                            unwillingness incur GOC rebuff, has told <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> continuation <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            participation depends entirely on him. By playing reluctant, HMG
                            believes <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> more likely make clear
                            importance British element to success of <gloss target="#t_UNPKF1">UNPKF</gloss>. Re numbers, Dodson claimed <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> came up with suggestion only
                            1200 British troops needed, e.g. one infantry battalion, two armored
                            scout car squadrons and supporting troops. This estimate based on
                                <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName>'s apparent belief
                            additional Irish or Danish troops will become available. HMG now
                            awaiting word from <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> re his wishes on
                            British participation.</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0156"/>
                        <p>We stressed to Dodson that Dept has no information to suggest GOC might
                            seek to blackball British participation. We reiterated great importance
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> attaches to such British
                            participation. We recalled two British troop reductions had taken place
                            without our being consulted. We emphasized our strong hope that before
                            any further reductions are decided upon, HMG consult with us. We also
                            emphasized any further British reductions should be phased into
                            availability other units and noted our impression <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> not likely obtain any substantial
                            increase in other national contingents.</p>
                        <p> Dodson claimed British troop reductions arranged by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> military officer (Bailey) working with
                            Rikhye in New York and seemed to assume matter should have been
                            discussed with us there. He took note our point, however, and we are
                            hopeful British now appreciate more fully great importance we attach to
                            matter and will in future keep in closer touch with us on this one.</p>

                        <p> LBJ: How'd you get along?</p>
                        <p> DR: Alright with <persName corresp="#p_Fulbright1">Fulbright</persName>,
                            Hickenlooper, and Dirksen.<note n="2" xml:id="d59fn2">According to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s Appointment Book,
                                he met at 4:45 p.m. with the three Senators at the New Senate Office
                                Building. (Ibid.) There was no indication of the topic of the
                                meeting.</note> I was not able to get a hold of Halleck, who is out
                            of town, and Bill Bundy was up with the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
                            And I will check with them. I haven't been able to reach them this
                            afternoon.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Alright.</p>
                        <p> DR: But, uh, but the others were alright. They had no problem.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Uh-huh, alright, now—</p>
                        <p> DR: Now, I've got a call in for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                                Ball</persName>. Mr. President, I think the problem here is that we
                            need to get him back to be sure that we are all on the same track here
                            and to see where we are going. That's my concern about that. If he goes
                            to Athens at this point, it could stimulate a good deal of excitement
                            without putting one foot forward. I don't think <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> is in a position yet to begin to
                            move toward a solution to this thing. And, uh, we, our talks in London
                            have not produced, ah enough agreement between us and the British about
                            how we proceed here.<note n="3" xml:id="d59fn3">See <ref target="#d58">Document 58</ref>.</note> I just think that since he now is not
                            planning to stop off in London but he was planning to come right on
                            back, that we've got to let him do it even though by the weekend we
                            might want to send him out to the area.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Alright. Now what's the, if you can't produce it while he is over
                            there, how is he going to produce it here?</p>
                        <p> DR: Well, I think that …</p>
                        <p> LBJ: With the British?</p>
                        <p> DR: I think, the point is that we—that you and he and I and our people
                            working on this should come to a final conclusion on what we ought to
                            shoot for. And there is not a conclusion on that at the moment, and the
                            conclusion that they have been talking about in London is something that
                            will almost guarantee the Turks would intervene and this is what
                            concerns me.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Uh-huh.</p>
                        <p> DR: We're not giving the Turks enough of a break here in the kind of
                            solution that they have been talking about—in London.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Well, is it necessary for him to get back here to do that? Is he an
                            integral part of our—?</p>
                        <p> DR: Oh, I think that it would be extremely helpful to me because he is
                            our most experienced man on this problem.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Uh-huh.</p>
                        <p> DR: And he could take a real leadership on it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0158"/> LBJ: I think it's a lot bigger
                            problem to send him after he gets back over there than let him go while
                            he's there, don't you?</p>
                        <p> DR: Uh-huh, well—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: It looks like it's just a routine thing, if he's there now. He's
                            been touring all over the continent.<note n="4" xml:id="d59fn4">See <ref target="#d56fn1">footnote 1, Document 56</ref>.</note> But
                            ah—</p>
                        <p> DR: There's another piece of information on this. The Greek Cypriot
                            Prime Minister<note n="5" xml:id="d59fn5">Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>.</note> has just arrived
                            in New York to ask for a Security Council meeting on this subject, so
                            that is likely to take the play away from other matters here for a brief
                            time.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Uh-huh. Well, is that good?</p>
                        <p> DR: Ah, I think so, sir. I—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Looks like we need some time to get some solutions, don't we?</p>
                        <p> DR: I think we do need some time here. This is one of the most—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: I'll defer to your judgment. If I were Secretary of State, I'd send
                            him to Greece and say, “Now, Mr. Prime Minister, here is what happened.
                            We were notified that they were going in and invade that night. We
                            prevailed on them not to do it. We don't think that things are going as
                            they ought to there and we are very concerned about what's going to
                            happen so we—our people are concerned. And we appeal to you to exercise
                            whatever influence you've got with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to try to let the United Nations work this
                            thing out for you instead of shooting at them and arresting them and
                            capturing them and running off with them. And we just think that if you
                            don't take some leadership here and move in, as we had to move in with
                            Turkey, that this is going to be a very bloody bath.” And now I don't
                            know what other specific proposals other than urging him to do that, but
                            it seems to me, then that would give us something to say to the Turks
                            that we've made an appeal to them and personally sent our man. Now if
                            you think that he ought to come back before he does that, why—</p>
                        <p> DR: I think that if you said that to the Greek Ambassador when he brings
                            you that message,<note n="6" xml:id="d59fn6">See <ref target="#d62">Document 62</ref>.</note> that would be, that would have the
                            greatest weight and influence in Athens. But let me talk to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> and get his judgment on
                            this point.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Alright. Ok. That's good. And I don't think, though, that Inonu is
                            going to think that's much—for me to talk to this little ambassador
                            here.</p>
                        <p> DR: Uh-huh.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: I think that if he thinks that this man has crossed the waters and
                            gone to Athens and put the heat on them just like we put the heat on the
                                <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0159"/>Turks, that he'll think we
                            are sincere and genuine and we're really working at it and not going to
                            sleep on it.</p>
                        <p> DR: Yes. Now there is a press report out of Ankara that <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> is replying and conditionally
                            accepting your invitation.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Uh-huh.</p>
                        <p> DR: I don't know what that kind of press leak means, but if he were to
                            come here in the next few days, I think that would be an important
                            step.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Well, I look at it the other way. I think that the last thing we
                            want him to do is let me be the peacemaker and later wind up on my lap.
                            I think we ought to carry it right to Ankara and Athens. Now that's my
                            country-boy approach to it.</p>
                        <p> DR: Alright.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: And I think that we got in trouble the other night when we
                            suggested to him that if he—I couldn't come over there, but I'd be glad
                            to see him but we were absolutely desperate and I let that go.<note n="7" xml:id="d59fn7">See <ref target="#d54">Document

                        <p> DR: Right.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: But when I got home and thought about it a little bit, I thought,
                            “Now what in the hell is <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Lyndon
                                Johnson</persName> doing inviting this big mess right in his lap?”
                            Bad enough for <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> to go
                            to them and see him without the President calling him over here. Because
                            I have no solution. I can't propose anything. He'll come over here
                            looking for heaven and he'll find hell.</p>
                        <p> DR: Well, his message—if it's a conditional message—will probably have
                            that kind of thing in it and would be the basis for deferring until we
                            get some further feeling out of it.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Well, my feeling is—and I don't want to be arbitrary and I won't be
                            a bit disappointed if he comes on—but I think you ought to let him
                            know—</p>
                        <p> DR: Yeah.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: —that I think that, in the light of this strong message I sent to
                            the Turks—</p>
                        <p> DR: Right.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: —that I need to follow through with the Greeks, and the easiest and
                            simplest and least-noticed way to do it is while he's there to spend two
                            hours doing it.</p>
                        <p> DR: Right.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Then I wouldn't hesitate the slightest to say to them, “Now, we're
                            going on and appeal to the Turks to hold this thing in abeyance,” and he
                            can go tell the Turks what he'd done—</p>

                            would have at least kept faith and made an effort and followed through
                            on what I told them in this wire instead of saying we went off and went
                            to sleep.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>The Honorable <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Henry Labouisse</persName>,
                            Ambassador of the United States in Athens has imparted to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">S. Costopoulos</persName>, the Greek Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, the concern of the American Government in view of
                            information about an imminent Turkish landing in Cyprus. He also
                            informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> of the
                            action taken by the American Government with the Government of Turkey,
                            in order to avert the landing.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Government wishes to express its warm thanks for this
                            appropriate and wise initiative of the President of the United States,
                            which agrees with the tradition of the American Nation as well as with
                            the mission of the United States as leader of the Free World.</p>
                        <p>We do not know if the above step has been decisively effective.
                            Information is reaching us that Turkey persists in the policy of landing
                            and is preparing for it; and that, in order to justify the landing, she
                            is staging the proclamation, by the very small Turkish minority of
                            Cyprus, of a federative or an independent State.<note n="2" xml:id="d60fn2">In telegram 1848 from Athens, June 9, 5 p.m., the
                                Embassy reported that a “revived atmosphere of crisis gripped
                                Athens” as a result of renewed reports of Turkish preparations for
                                an invasion of Cyprus. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 23–8

                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>The Greek Government has repeatedly declared and reasserts today that its
                            policy is peace; but, in case of aggression, it will be defense.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Government most assuredly regards a Turkish landing in Cyprus
                            as an aggression; because the resolution of the Security Council of the
                            4th of March would thus be violated and also because such an action aims
                            at the strangulation of the rights of the great Greek majority of the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>This will be one of the consequences of an eventual Turkish landing: a
                            Greek-Turkish conflict and the dissolution of the Southeastern flank of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. But this will not be the only
                            consequence. Communism will become omnipotent within the island of
                            Cyprus; and, we unfortunately fear, within Greece, where, with our
                            policies, we have reduced it to 12%. Besides, it is inevitable and human
                            that the Greeks of Cyprus, threatened by a Turkish invasion tolerated by
                            the Allies, should seek help wherever they can find it. And it is known,
                            under the present circumstance, whence this help will be offered. An
                            objective assessment of the future, unfortunately leads to the certain
                            forecast that, under these conditions, Cyprus will end into another Cuba
                            and that the Greek Government will no longer be in a position to
                            exercise any restraining influence.</p>
                        <p>We feel that a critical hour has struck and we regard it our duty to
                            define responsibilities before the Greek nation, before the Free World
                            to which we belong, as well as before History. And this is the meaning
                            of the present message.</p>

                            on Cyprus as crucial test of US attitudes, influence and abilities.
                            After events of June 5, all parties consider we are now deeply involved
                            and look for us to take positive position in New York. It is common
                            belief our policy on Cyprus has changed, but SC will be regarded as acid
                            test of this belief.</p>
                        <p>Reading the political temper in Cyprus, we believe either emergency or
                            scheduled <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting may prove major
                            watershed in Greek Cypriot attitudes. As we have reported with
                            increasing frequency, Communists have been going all out to enmesh Greek
                            Cypriots by espousing principles of freedom and democracy, offering
                            assistance and promising support. Having a favorably conditioned
                            audience, the Communists have up to this point made extensive progress
                            with most elements of Greek Cypriot society. Their accomplishments have
                            been impressive and give cause for serious concern, but thus far we
                            estimate them to be generally shallow in nature. The fickle, politically
                            immature Greek Cypriots could quickly change their view of their “real
                            friends”, if given the occasion.</p>
                        <p>The show down which now appears to be at hand, would threaten to give
                            Communist accomplishments in Cyprus a deeper, more lasting character
                            where permanent damage might be done to the orientation of the Greek
                            Cypriot leadership as well as many other elements of the society.</p>
                        <p>Given this ticklish situation, the problem for the US will be how to
                            handle itself on policy without alienating the Greek Cypriots and giving
                            the Soviets the opening for which they hope. In this circumstance
                            perhaps it would be best to let troop contributing countries carry the
                            ball on sensitive terms of reference issue (assuming discussion this
                            issue cannot be avoided) where US involvement in substance would
                            probably range us among opponents of GOC.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, one point where US might be able to make major
                            productive contribution to work of <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, a
                            contribution which relates to principal concern of Greek Cypriots about
                            threat of Turkish military <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0163"/>intervention. If US could produce as its contribution a Turkish
                            commitment not to intervene in Cyprus for the duration of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> involvement, this would be major
                            accomplishment which should go far toward re-establishing our damaged
                            position here.</p>

                        <p>After the President greeted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> cordially, the Ambassador said he understood that
                            the President had already taken action on the letter now being formally
                            delivered. However, <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> had no
                            report as yet on the <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            conversation in Athens.<note n="2" xml:id="d62fn2">See <ref target="#d64">Document 64</ref>.</note> The President then
                            carefully read Prime Minister Papandreou's letter.<note n="3" xml:id="d62fn3">
                                <ref target="#d60">Document 60</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The President made clear our position on the Cyprus crisis. Outside
                            powers could not solve it. The Greeks and Turks must settle it
                            themselves. He believed the Prime Minister of Greece should get together
                            with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, or have
                            some representative talk with the Turks. We had told Turkey that there
                            could not be war but we didn't know how long this would stick. Moreover,
                            we were “disappointed” that the Greek Government had not taken the
                            initiative to meet and talk with the Turks. It was much more dangerous
                            not to get together than to <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0164"/>get
                            together. As we saw it, there were two requirements for a solution: (a)
                            whatever was done must be permanent; (b) the solution could not be
                            humiliating to either side. It was much more dangerous not to have a
                            solution. War could help nobody. Therefore, the President continued, he
                            had told <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> to urge Papandreou
                            to take the initiative in getting together somehow with the Turks. The
                            US people were becoming quite worried over the Cyprus problem; they
                            couldn't understand why “two of our close allies were growling at each
                            other.” As for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he
                            didn't seem to care. He thought he had the Greeks supporting him.
                            Meanwhile, the Soviets were meddling and fully expected to win in the
                            end. So we thought the Greeks must show some statesmanship and get
                            moving toward agreement.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the theme of American public attitudes. Some
                            Americans were already wondering if they should go to Europe and to the
                            Eastern Mediterranean now. There was no reason why Turkey and Greece
                            couldn't agree to talk about their problem. It would be dangerous if
                            they did not. To repeat, this solution should be permanent and not
                            humiliating to either side. We had gone to the aid of Greece and Turkey
                            in the Truman Doctrine. We had helped through the years, and wanted to
                            help now. But Greece and Turkey must grasp the problem. We had stopped
                            the Turks from moving, but we couldn't drop the matter there. We wanted
                            to see them at the conference table. Greece should take the
                            initiative.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked what response his government had given to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. The President replied that they
                            seemed to be considering our démarche. But he urged a Greek initiative.
                            Action was what was needed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> explained that the chief
                            need as his government saw it was to stop the constant threats of
                            invasion. The President interrupted him, saying we had stopped it
                            already but couldn't stop it always. We had acted vigorously when
                            trouble was imminent, but we might not be able to stop the Turks
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> agreed there
                            were still dangers ahead. His government had disturbing reports in the
                            last day or so, including reported overflights of Rhodes. The President
                            replied, “If I can't get you to talk, I can't keep the Turks from
                            moving.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> again sought to explain
                            the Greek position. He reported that the whole trouble lay in the
                            continuing Turkish threat to invade Cyprus. The President interjected:
                            “Or in your support of what <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is doing—or in arms imports.” The Ambassador
                            replied that otherwise <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            would have felt isolated. There were two dangers: The Greek-Turkish
                            tensions and the risk of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> drifting to “the other side.” Both are the
                            consequence of the Turkish threats. If only the US could secure Turkish
                            agreement not to invade, then tensions would be reduced and there would
                            be no need for arms imports to Cyprus, etc. etc. The <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0165"/>President emphasized that we could not
                            get the threat called off until the Greeks had agreed to talk. This
                            called for statesmanship. Papandreou was a statesman. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> should tell his Prime Minister
                            to call <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> today and arrange a
                            meeting. We had done everything we could. Our troubles around the world
                            these days were not our own; our troubles turned out to be mostly
                            disputes between our allies. Certainly Greece and Turkey would not be
                            justified in destroying <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> over this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> asked if the President
                            thought it impossible to get the Turks not to invade. The President
                            said: “Nothing is impossible if people will act.” But Papandreou must
                            act in this case if we were to have peace and not war. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> tried to point out again that
                            Turkish agreement not to invade was the key to the situation. The
                            President said bluntly that we could not get the Turks to turn off until
                            there was some basis on which to argue with them. He noted that the
                            Greek Government was apparently willing to have secret talks (this
                            surprised <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> who was
                            obviously unaware of this. So Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KRW1">Komer</persName> confirmed that the Foreign Minister had said
                            secret talks were possible). <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> then asked whether any US proposals had been
                            mentioned by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. The President
                            said that we were not going to make proposals ourselves at this point.
                            Any US proposals would be seized upon by one side or the other and used
                            to blame us. We want the Greeks and Turks to start making proposals to
                            each other. This should be a matter between the two of them. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> added: “And the Cypriots.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> said that “talks are
                            difficult under the threat of invasion.” The President immediately came
                            back: “Of course they're difficult. But it's more difficult to talk
                            after an invasion. Get together and work something out. If not, all
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will become involved.”</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador contended that the Greeks from the beginning had sought to
                            keep the dispute damped down and avoid actions which increased the
                            threat of hostilities. He gave examples of proposals advanced to the
                            British, cooperating with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, etc. In
                            contrast, he said, the Turks have done everything to spread the dispute,
                            as by their treatment of the Greeks in Istanbul. The President said he
                            thought Papandreou should appoint someone and talk with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> immediately. Talk was far better
                            than the way of the jungle. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> attempted to return to the theme of calling the
                            Turks off. The President interrupted him again saying: “I have only a
                            temporary hold-off. What we want is for your Prime Minister to sit down
                            with the Turkish Prime Minister and work out an agreement. Our people
                            are getting terribly worried.” <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> said that temporary cessation of the invasion
                            threat won't solve the problem: it won't keep <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from building up arms
                            supplies. The President responded that nothing would. The President
                            said: “The Turks are the only ones I have gotten to do anything till
                            now. All I want is for the Greek Prime Minister to sit down and talk.
                            This is not so difficult.” He pointed out that by just this means he had
                            gotten the railroad strike settled in ten <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0166"/>days. But Greece always wants Turkey to do something to
                            ease tensions and Turkey always wants Greece to do something. What was
                            the Greek program for settling the crisis?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> described the desire for a
                            fully independent state with self-determination and guarantees of
                            minority rights. He noted this was a “compromise” position (i.e. not
                            enosis). He asked what the President thought of this approach. The
                            President said that we couldn't negotiate for the Turks. All we wanted
                            was for Greece to get together with them. It wasn't up to us to say what
                            agreement should be reached. “We stopped an invasion the other night.
                            Now we want a conference. Let's start discussing this thing.” He again
                            mentioned the problem of American tourists going to the threatened area.
                            It was easier to talk than to fight. The President told the Ambassador:
                            “You will only be admired for saying ‘let's talk’.” It was a matter of
                            the Biblical injunction, “Come let us reason together.” <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> said he would so report to his
                            government.</p>
                        <p>The President then changed tactics and pointed out the strong American
                            affection for Greece. The President himself would like to travel there
                            again soon with his family. But there could not be a war. We had turned
                            off the Turks. Now we want talks. As Speaker Rayburn had said, “It's
                            always better to talk than fight.” <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> tried once more to press the theme that the US or
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council should get the
                            Turks to call off their invasion threats. The President said, “Let's see
                            what you can do for us and we will see what we can do for you.”
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> sought to inquire
                            whether this meant the President would get Turkey to agree permanently
                            not to invade. The President carefully avoided any such commitment. He
                            said: “I made a positive request of the Turks and they said that even
                            though they didn't agree they would comply. I now make a positive
                            request to you to talk. If you comply, we will then make some
                            suggestions to the Turks. That's better than fighting.” The President
                            did not tell him what these suggestions would be, but promised that if
                            Papandreou would try to bring Greece and Turkey together, we would help
                            all we could to move things along to an agreement. Otherwise we'd have a
                            disaster.</p>
                        <p>The President asked <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> to tell
                            his Prime Minister of the President's deep sense of friendship for him
                            and for Greece. The President was counting heavily on Papandreou. We did
                            not want the US people to get the idea that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was “using” the Greeks. “Greece must avoid at
                            all costs humiliating its ally Turkey. Even in the Cuban missile crisis,
                            we always left the enemy a way out. With an ally it was even more
                            important to leave a way out.”</p>
                        <p>The President observed that negotiating with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was impossible. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> wasn't interested in the security of the West.
                            But Greece, Turkey, and the US were. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> interjected that Greece could not negotiate
                            without <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. The President
                            indicated understanding that the <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0167"/>Cypriots would have to be consulted at some point but the important
                            thing was Greek-Turkish agreement. Greece talked about its
                            responsibil-ities to the Greek Cypriots. Didn't the Greeks see that the
                            fate of 100,000 Turkish Cypriots was a matter of honor for <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> too?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> assured the
                            President that he would promptly inform his Government.</p>

                            highlights:</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stressed that
                            principal reason he decided for time being not call urgent <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg was his awareness Pres
                                <persName>Johnson</persName>'s efforts with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> which he did not wish upset as he hopeful it would
                            produce something. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>
                            emphasized seriousness present situation stressing <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> concern with Cypriot arms imports,
                            conscription, disappearance hostages, ties with SovBloc. Situation
                            deteriorating and there need work actively for solution agreeable to all
                            parties before situation deteriorates further. Said he hoped GOC had
                            given thought to this as obvious that in any solution no party will get
                            everything it wants.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> responding to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> mention of GOC
                            moves cited provocative <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> acts
                            (including use <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> soldiers for smuggling)
                            leading to GOC arms and conscription decisions and defended these as
                            right and duty of GOC. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>
                            said situation difficult to control. Was worse than in March and GOC had
                            not exercised restraint he had hoped, or avoided provocations as he
                            hoped. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stressed GOC had
                            avoided number of moves and <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> provided chapter and verse on Turk contingent,
                            “rebels” at Hilarion, obstruction on Kyrenia Road.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> stressed need create
                            feeling of confidence among Turk Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied “ If <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wants them have confidence they'll have it. Their
                            unease ordered by Ankara. Everything calm where <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> not stirring them up.” Turk Cypriot discontent is
                            manufactured as result longstanding <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0168"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> partition plan of which GOC amassing
                            more and more evidence. Denied arms imports and conscription designed
                            have any effect on Turk Cypriots stating they reaction to: (1) invasion
                            threats; (2) need to discipline Greek Cypriot forces. In response
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> question, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said regular GOC army would
                            disarm irregular Greek Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> again stressed
                            seriousness of situation mentioning <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            fear of new “Cuba.” <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said
                            this new idea but <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName>
                            emphasized Greek Cypriot Communists few and without arms and
                            nationalists in control. Nationalists got main outside support from
                            SovBloc as result Western lack of sympathy.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> state of negots with Sovs and
                            Czechs on arms. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>,
                            hesitating somewhat, denied there were such negots. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> noted GOC would abandon arms
                            acquisition if <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> guaranteed territorial
                            integrity. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> defended
                            acquisition of arms “from US or anywhere,” not necessarily from Sovs and
                            Czechs.</p>
                        <p>6. In reply <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> query on
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said 1) not abandon idea urgent mtg; 2)
                            planned in regular mtg raise question Turk threat, exit of Turk
                            contingent along with Greek.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> stressed <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> feeling that they have been pushed back
                            steadily from Zurich agreements and cannot tolerate this, particularly
                            in view of method by which this done. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> noted initial method was negots.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> emphasized US
                            effectiveness in restraining <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            diminishing because of GOC moves, urged <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> “bend over backwards avoid provocations”,
                            saying would be wise not take any actions which would exacerbate Turk
                            feelings and plan quiet <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg instead to
                            extend <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> on basis <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> report and then might be possible move
                            forward toward solution. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            countered asking how fact recent <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            preparations can be hidden and mentioned expanding <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mandate to include <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee against attack. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> remarked this unlikely.</p>
                        <p>9. Referring ideas in press for population exchange, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stressed Turk Cypriots wanted
                            return to villages but cannot because of Turk Cypriot terrorists'
                            threats. With choice, only 20 per cent would leave Cyprus, he said.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> suggested offering
                            reassurances in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to Turk Cypriots to
                            improve atmosphere but <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            responded that this would be admitting <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> threats justified.</p>
                        <p>10. Referring again <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> threats,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said “We not
                            importing planes and tanks to fight Turk Cypriots.” Went on describe
                            Mansoura as center smuggling of Turk arms and men which GOC cannot and
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not stop, implying this would
                            be exposed in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and would have been
                            publicly described previously except for bearing it has on trial <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> airman.</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0169"/>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> called for “bold
                            move”—dismantling all fortifications by both sides leaving security to
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>12. On problem hostages, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            said there had been regrettable incidents but not as many as charged.
                            Claimed many on Turk list solely in Ankara or hidden in villages.
                            Claimed <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> had not deplored
                            hostage taking as <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had
                            and had no accounting for 39 Greek hostages.</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> suggested further
                            talk prior <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg. Again stressed US
                            efforts with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Urged avoiding
                            clamorous <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> mtg in order move on to next
                            step.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Fol mtg, MisOff encountered Asiroglu

                            strongly against it. Expressed hope <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> would find similar discouragement elsewhere.
                            Asiroglu stated he confident in Norway, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, perhaps France. MisOff suggested he talk to others

                            stressed <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> urging
                            non-polemic mtg. Asiroglu had earlier told MisOff <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> not now planning bring Turk Cypriot

                            me to reappraise the play of forces in the Cyprus problem and to modify
                            my thinking as to where we should go from here.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Athens</p>
                        <p>The significant impressions I gained in Athens are the following:</p>
                        <p>1. For the first time the Greek Government is scared—scared at the
                            reality of the danger of a Greek-Turkish war and at the progressive
                            extension of Communist control in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is fed up with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Papandreou wants to deal him
                            out of any settlement talks. (This is a marked change from a few months
                            ago when the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> was insisting that
                            Cyprus could not be discussed without <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> participating.)</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is now pleading for a strong
                            American intervention in the search for a settlement. (This again
                            contrasts sharply with its earlier attitude when it supported <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' efforts to exclude us from a
                            serious role in the Cyprus situation.)</p>
                        <p>There were strong indications that Papandreou would like to have the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> force a settlement on the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that it could accept only with the
                            excuse of outside pressure.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Ankara</p>
                        <p>On the Turkish side, <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> is doing
                            everything possible to maneuver us into taking responsibility for
                            bringing about a settlement. The Turks are clearly frightened of the
                            Cyprus situation. They are perplexed and sad. They also want us to force
                            a settlement on them—provided adequate face-saving aspects can be
                            devised.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Washington</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances we are now in position for the first time to
                            bring the Cyprus matter to a conclusion if we are prepared to invest
                            time, energy and prestige. The alternatives are dismal.</p>
                        <pb n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0171"/>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is totally unable to make even a
                            beginning on a solution. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>
                            has flopped around for three months and has achieved nothing whatever
                            except to discredit himself with the Greek and Turkish Governments. This
                            is not altogether his fault since the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            holds no cards in this game. Moreover, it is under the disability of
                            having to genuflect to the <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> Government. But <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> quite clearly has operated on the wrong
                            assumption—that the Cyprus problem was an affair between the two
                            communities on the Island and not an argument between Greece and Turkey.
                            His efforts to work out a solution from the vantage point of Nicosia
                            were doomed to failure. It would have made quite as much sense for a
                            mediator to try to solve the Kashmir problem by sitting for three months
                            in Kashmir.</p>
                        <p> U Thant knows that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot succeed
                            in settling this question. Tuomioja is sick of it and wants out. I think
                            it altogether likely that we could get their tacit acquiescence to a
                            vigorous USG initiative.</p>
                        <p>Quite obviously Papandreou needs a far greater shock than I was able to
                            give him Wednesday night but I made a start. We need to lay on a crash
                            effort to bring the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> up short. But
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is a hard nut to crack and we
                            are far from being home with this one.</p>
                        <p>Even so there are indications that Papandreou is ready to start low-level
                            conversations with the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Certainly
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is dying for a chance to start
                            talking with the Greeks. But it won't occur without us. Both Papandreou
                            and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> indicated quite clearly
                            to me that they envisaged a successful negotiation only under active
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> tutelage. I am convinced that a
                            meeting between representatives of the two Governments, without the
                            active presence of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, would be
                            likely to lead only to a deepening crystallization of positions.
                            Certainly this was the result when <persName corresp="#p_SD1">Sandys</persName> tried it out in London last January.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Recommendation</p>
                        <p>I think therefore, that the central thrust of our effort should be
                            directed at bringing representatives of the two Governments together
                            with a strong <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> representative as a
                            catalyst—under quiet conditions. The pattern, in other words, would not
                            be unlike that which we followed successfully in disposing of the West
                            New Guinea problem.<note n="3" xml:id="d64fn3">Reference is to Ellsworth
                                Bunker's role in the 1962 Netherlands-Indonesian talks regarding

                        </p>
                        <p>I doubt that the United States should try to put forward any plan for
                            settlement. Certainly it should not do so at the outset of negotiations.
                            The Greek and Turkish Governments are now latched on to enosis and
                            double enosis respectively. There should be room for bargaining under
                            these circumstances. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> made it clear that there was—so far as the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> was concerned.</p>
                        <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0172"/>
                        <p>I would suggest, as one possibility, that we think of trying to arrange a
                            meeting at some quiet, neutral spot such as the Villa Bellagio on Lake
                            Como where representatives of the two Governments—perhaps at the
                            Ambassadorial level—would be brought together with a respected but
                            hard-boiled American, such as <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                                Acheson</persName>, who knows the score and is not afraid to use
                            American pressure.</p>
                        <p>Every effort should be made to keep this meeting secret, although we
                            should quietly tell the British and perhaps U Thant what we were doing.
                            Given the present state of Greek feelings, I think it possible that
                            Papandreou could be persuaded to arrange this without letting the word
                            pass to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>As a condition to our undertaking this, we should exact from the two
                            Governments a firm commitment to try to hold still the two communities
                            on the Island pending the outcome.</p>
                        <p>I think we must put this show on the road right away. Time is definitely
                            not running on our side. We can get Turkish approval when <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> comes to Washington. Meanwhile we
                            should give thought to whether Papandreou might not be invited to pay us
                            a visit.<note n="4" xml:id="d64fn4">In telegram 1513 to Athens, June 13,

                            Ambassador our revised view on double enosis, saying that we now thought
                            it should be put forward to the Greeks and Turks as a serious basis for
                            discussion (rather than dismissing it too quickly from consideration, as
                            had been implied during the discussions in London June 8).<note n="2" xml:id="d65fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s conclusion that “hard
                                bargaining” might result in “enosis plus territorial and other
                                compensation to Turkey,” was reported in Unsec 32 to Geneva, June 9.
                                (Ibid.)</note> He also explained that he did not think it would be
                            well to have the mediator make the proposals of enosis and double enosis
                            to the parties.</p>
                        <p>We were giving serious thought to doing some “arm twisting” with the
                            Greeks and Turks to induce them to negotiate realistically for a
                            settlement. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            was probably coming to Washington and we planned to invite Prime
                            Minister Papandreou as well. The President would bear down on both of
                            them. Our tentative plan of action after that would be to get Greek and
                            Turkish representatives together with an American representative as a
                            third party. This meeting, which should be kept absolutely secret, would
                            have as its object to hammer out an agreement which the mediator could
                            then pick up and work on. We thought this plan had a chance of success
                            because Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had found during
                            his most recent visit to Athens and Ankara that both Papandreou and
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had a changed attitude
                            and wanted the United States to take an active direct role in bringing
                            about a settlement.</p>
                        <p>We and the British should, therefore, tell U Thant and the mediator that
                            we were going to make a real effort to get the problem settled, as it
                            must be, between Athens and Ankara. We would not ask U Thant and the
                            mediator to propose any bases for solutions to the Greeks and Turks (as
                            had been contemplated in the papers worked out in London). We would just
                            let <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> keep on doing what
                            he is doing now, for the time being.</p>
                        <p> Lord Harlech said he would tell London we thought it would not be
                            helpful for the mediator to take any initiative.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Department would prepare a new draft of proposed
                            instructions to Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> and <persName>Dean</persName> in New York, and
                            send a copy urgently to Lord Harlech for transmission to London.<note n="3" xml:id="d65fn3">The instructions embodying <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s comments were sent to the

                                8, reported that Greece remained firm on its ultimate objective of
                                enosis but recognized the need for some limited concessions to
                                Turkey and counted on the United States to achieve a mediated
                                settlement. (Ibid.)</note> We assume comments desired are our views
                            on feasibility of new approach to Cyprus problem in form of secret
                            bilateral negotiations between Greece and Turkey with objective of
                            agreement on union of Cyprus with Greece compensated by some mix of
                            following elements: minor Greek territorial concession to Turkey,
                            emigration of Greek minority from Turkey (with assisted voluntary
                            emigration of Turkish Cypriots to Turkey?), transfer of Patriarchate
                            from Istanbul, and Turkish military base on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>We not only concur that it would be useful explore this possibility but
                            also believe satisfactory settlement can only be achieved along these
                            lines.</p>
                        <p>At same time we wish point out that, while Turkish Cypriots have no
                            alternative to accepting whatever deal Turkey may make, Greek Cypriots
                            have greater independence from Greece. Despite their protestations about
                            Panhellenism, it might take considerable persuasion to win Greek Cypriot
                            acceptance of some elements of deal along lines suggested above.</p>
                        <p>While there has been marked intensification of enosis agitation in recent
                            months, two very significant elements of Greek Cypriot community are at
                            best lukewarm and at worst hostile toward it. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and GOC officials obviously
                            have vested interest of being large fish in small puddle. A strong and
                            apparently growing Communist movement would obviously resist submersion
                            and probable suppression in Greece. Coalition of these two elements
                            would be quite likely insist in first instance on “full sovereignty”,
                            “self determination”, “neutrality rather than <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>” as dodges for avoiding enosis. For this reason we
                            believe that, if enosis is agreed on as basis for solution, every effort
                            must be made bring it about as integral part of immediate settlement
                            rather than agreeing on “full independence” or “self-determination” on
                            understanding Cyprus state will wither away and enosis will inevitably
                            occur.</p>
                        <p>We would not anticipate any serious Greek Cypriot opposition (though
                            there would probably be a lot of noisy protest) about Greek territorial
                            cessions elsewhere or about population movements. Greek Cypriot <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0175"/>attitude is wholly
                            self-centered. On other hand, we would expect strong resistance to
                            Turkish base on island, in part as desecration of “holy soil” but even
                            more out of fear it would be used as center for agitation among
                            remaining Turkish community. Limited Turkish military presence might
                            eventually be palatable if it were on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base within what is now British sovereign base
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Another area in which Greek Cypriots might demonstrate independence of
                            Greece, as recent history makes only too clear, is by reneging on
                            agreement once made in order attempt eliminate any special concessions
                            to Turkey or Turkish Cypriots on island. Fact Greek Cypriots cannot be
                            trusted makes it all the more important enosis be part immediate
                            settlement and not as goal to which settlement might eventually open
                            way. Considering Cypriot temperament, strong Communist influences,
                            resentments arising from current strife, and widespread holding of arms,
                            we have every reason to expect Cyprus to be source of difficulties for
                            years to come. It is certainly far preferable this be internal Greek
                            problem rather than international problem of type now facing us.</p>

                            Attaché Athens Karaoglou to effect that Turkish invasion Cyprus would
                            result in “immediate fall” Papandreou government and his substitution by
                            military junta. If this belief also held by important <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> officials, Embassy believes it
                            important clear up what appears to us to be misreading of situation. Our
                            reading is that in event Turkish invasion Cyprus and subsequent
                            Papandreou military response, government would have full backing of
                            Greek nation. In our judgment only if government were to fail to take
                            some action satisfactory to injured Greek pride would there be <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0176"/>threat to Papandreou's
                            continuance in office. It should be noted that there is no important
                            element in Greek political life calling for more “moderate” approach to
                            Cyprus problem; on contrary, Papandreou being attacked by both right and
                            extreme left for not pushing Greek and Greek Cypriot cause more
                            vigorously. Opposition (<gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>) press, for
                            example, accuses Papandreou of “retreating” in face of US pressure to
                            seek quick solution Cyprus question.</p>
                        <p>In any case, it important that senior <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            officials not labor under mistaken belief that Papandreou ahead of press
                            and public in following “hard” line vis-à-vis Cyprus question. On
                            contrary, in view inflamed public opinion here, great test for <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> will come if and when he agrees
                            to compromise settlement on Cyprus which falls short Greek demands. It
                            conceivable that if he agreed to what public opinion considered
                            “sell-out” on Cyprus, his many enemies within and without party might
                            combine to bring him down. In that event, successor would almost
                            certainly be figure with more intransigent view Cyprus settlement. In
                            sense, Papandreou now paying for fact that during last two electoral
                            campaigns he tried win votes by riding Cypriot tiger and attacking
                            Caramanlis administration for “sell-out” of London and Zurich
                            Agreements. Although he avoided stating exactly what final solution he
                            expected to achieve, public led to believe that Papandreou victory would
                            result in Cypriot independence and enosis, if not immediately at least
                            eventually. Thus, when and if Papandreou sits down to serious
                            negotiations public opinion will expect him to deliver on at least part
                            of his promises, explicit or implied.</p>
                        <p>To reiterate: in our view Papandreou would have full support of nation in
                            military response to Turkish invasion. (Although once heat of battle
                            passed there might be second thoughts about how Greece was maneuvered
                            into such position.) Only if he failed to take some dramatic action
                            would his position be jeopardized. In such case his successor would
                            undoubtedly be advocate of harder line. However, in view Papandreou's
                            character—as well as his stated commitments to respond to Turk
                            “attack”—it highly unlikely that he would follow passive course under
                            such circumstances.</p>

                        <p>1898. I saw Papandreou this morning accompanied by <persName corresp="#p_BHD1">Brewster</persName>. After preliminaries, I handed
                            over President's letter.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2">See <ref target="#d64fn4">footnote 4, Document 64</ref>.</note>
                            Papandreou read it carefully and said he would be glad to accept, and
                            that June 24 and 25 would be satisfactory provided <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had then left. He stressed that it
                            would be most embarrassing if they were both there at same time and made
                            this point a flat condition. He feels it would be most awkward if both
                            were there at same time and they did not see one another, and he does
                            not consider it politically feasible to have a meeting with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> at this time.</p>
                        <p>I believe that Papandreou is sincere in his belief that an over-lapping
                            with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> would cause real
                            difficulties, and I strongly recommend that the President set the date
                            for Papandreou's arrival and meeting with him so as to avoid possible
                            over-lapping.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou then went on to say that, as practical politicians, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and he would not want
                            to have a meeting which failed. He said that he had tried to make the
                            Greek position clear to me in previous conversations and to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> last week. He hoped the
                            President would understand that the Greek position had been formulated
                            “objectively” and on the basis of principles of justice. I responded
                            that it was not my understanding that President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had in mind reaching a definite
                            solution of the Cyprus problem during the proposed discussions. He was
                            not attempting to short-circuit the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            The purpose of the talks was to exchange views on ways to move toward a
                            solution. He replied that he was not posing this as a condition to a
                            meeting but he thought the President would want to know his views. He
                            said he would put these in a letter which he would deliver to me this
                            evening.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then proceeded to outline
                            his position, very much in the same way he has done on previous
                            occasions and with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.
                            There was nothing new in his presentation, except for his emphasis on
                            fact that entry of Soviets in picture had made Cyprus issue a great deal
                            more far-reaching than simply a Greek-Turkish problem. From the
                            “security” point of view, the only hope was “Natofication,” including a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base which could have Turkish
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> personnel. From “moral”
                            viewpoint there should be self-determination. The present limited
                            independence <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0178"/>should be lifted
                            and self-determination exercised in the form of a plebiscite (resulting
                            in union with Greece) to take place before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces leave the island; i.e., within three months. He
                            stressed that an independent Cyprus would mean a Cuba and a partitioned
                            Cyprus would lead inevitably to conflict between the 400,000 Greeks and
                            the 100,000 Turks which would only continue the crisis situation.</p>
                        <p>He asked what I thought about this. Reverting to his security argument, I
                            suggested that Turks might well think double enosis would best serve
                            purpose. He replied that even if he should order partition the
                            population of the island would not accept it and civil war and chaos
                            would ensue. In both cases the Communists would be the winners. Only by
                            a close link with the West could this be averted.</p>
                        <p>I observed that even though his arguments might sound “objective” to
                            many, there was still an important psychological factor and political
                            realities which Inonu had to face. I suggested that if Menderes had been
                            able to negotiate a deal which disallowed enosis, it would be expecting
                            a lot for <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> to accept it. I
                            repeated the question I had often posed to him—what could be done to
                            meet <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> half way? He came to
                            his “security” argument, repeating that the new factor since 1959 was
                            that Sov Union was on scene and would be muddying waters. He felt that
                            the US should stress heavily to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that Natofication would achieve the security of
                            the island within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework
                            and Turkey would not have a Cuba off its southern shore. This solution
                            could also get <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> out of
                            the way which should be helpful to the Turkish Govt with its problem of
                            face. Also, compensation could be provided for the Turk Cypriots who
                            wanted to move to the mainland, and further economic aid from the West
                            might be promised. He underlined (more for US benefit, I think, than for
                            the Turks) that this solution would be a lasting one and arrived at
                            within framework of democratic principles.</p>
                        <p>I pressed him on score as to whether compensation he was offering would
                            be adequate to meet the Turkish political and psychological problem
                            facing <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. He had nothing to
                            add to above. When I touched briefly on question of possible territorial
                            exchanges based on news reports he took standard Greek line that giving
                            up islands such as Chios, Mytilini or Samos would be inconceivable. It
                            would lead to revolution in Greece.</p>
                        <p>Our talk, which was highly informal (no other Greeks present) and
                            friendly throughout, did not touch on displacement of Istanbul
                            population and Patriarchate.<note n="3" xml:id="d68fn3">In telegram 1899

                            would not make any statement. He would parry questions with formula “I

                            held up also, pending consideration of content of formal letter, which

                            indirectly. Items covered were Inonu visit; my frequent consultations

                            effort; gave credit several recent moves including offer Green Line
                            pull-back; urged him make some unilateral gesture even in face Turkish

                            small Greek villages in area. Said he had reports that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had urged villagers at Mosphili to
                            evacuate, but when they had inquired whether they should do so, he had
                            refused allow them. Said he will move to protect Greeks if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cannot do so and if Turks did
                            nothing.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, he expressed oft-repeated Greek Cypriot position that
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> not forceful enough in preventing
                            such incidents and in particular in this northwest area they apparently
                            unable control smuggling of arms and people by Turks. He said if present
                            situation continues much longer or if today's incident becomes more
                            serious, he will move to isolate area from rest of island. In this
                            connection said he had told Plaza (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1356)<note n="6" xml:id="d69fn6">Telegram 1356, June

                            not opened, I said I was sure he had estimated far better than I what
                            probable reaction of Turks might be to such action. Said he had and
                            (contrary to what he told Plaza) he expected they would react violently,
                            but he was prepared to take consequences since present situation
                            intolerable.</p>
                        <p>When he went on to say he was more pessimistic now than he had been in

                            reaction might be to any such action on his part, particularly in view
                            of present delicate situation in which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> leadership found itself. At this point he asked me
                            whether <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> really thought that Turks
                            had intended invade two weeks ago. I said that this was matter of
                            conjecture for some, but that we were satisfied they had intended do so
                            and it was only with greatest possible pressure that we had dissuaded
                            them. Expressed hope that we would not have to try again.</p>

                            to yield constructive results, critical new situation might confront us

                            in British Ambassador to explain how we view upcoming talks with

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said our objective is to get

                            to undertake this task. We estimate Turks will agree, but Papandreou
                            will be more difficult. We expect tell Papandreou close vote of

                            that Turks deeply frustrated. If no movement on Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> could fall. We should be under no
                            illusions that Turks might then move militarily, whatever we said to
                            them. If Turks moved there would be no question of stopping them with
                            Sixth Fleet or other military means, because we would not fight our
                            allies.</p>
                        <p>Object in taking this line will be to demonstrate to Papandreou what
                            dangers Greece, Turkey and Western world could face on very short notice
                            unless Greece and Turkey able to compromise their positions. Assuming
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> will by then have agreed
                            to talks, Papandreou will be told flatly that he will be risking
                            security of his country and of Alliance unless he also agrees to
                            substantive talks.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GSDOLH1">Harlech</persName> agreed Greeks must
                            face up to dangers. US should “make their flesh creep” by spelling out
                            prospects and making them understand US would not stop Turkish
                            intervention if it were started contrary to American advice.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> raised question of British
                            plans for such contingency. He returned to discussions of last February
                            when London had agreed to consider possible tripartite intervention
                            should Turks move. <persName corresp="#p_GSDOLH1">Harlech</persName>
                            drew back fast from that particular suggestion. He left impression
                            British would want no part of fresh military intervention in Cyprus. He
                            did not think HMG had ever agreed to intervention though there had been
                            talk of trying to get Turks and Greeks to limit their advances should
                            they land on island.</p>
                        <p>On June 21 <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> met with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> and Sec <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> to review contingencies on
                            which State-Defense planning should focus in immediate future.<note n="5" xml:id="d70fn5">No record of this conversation has been
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our contingency problem is what US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            could do if <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Papandreou
                            talks should result in impasse and if <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s moderation was then eclipsed by more activist
                            Turkish forces, leading to Turkish military intervention in Cyprus. This
                            could now occur without our getting much advance warning. In any case we
                            not at all certain we could turn Turks off again even if we had
                            notice.</p>
                        <p>This would obviously be war nobody could win. We do not see how Greeks
                            could stop Turkish landing or put effective Greek forces on Cyprus.
                            Nonetheless, Greek and Greek Cypriots could harass Turkish action, delay
                            actual landing of total Turkish force and plunge island into bloodbath.
                            If Greeks widened attack to mainland areas, consequences <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0183"/>could be disastrous. Meanwhile UNSC
                            activity would be intense. Western security interests could only be
                            seriously jeopardized and none but Soviets could gain, whether or not
                            they threatened to intervene militarily in Turkey or Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Turks, if they moved, would hold they acting legally under Article IV of
                            Treaty after failure of Guarantor Powers to take effective joint action
                            to restore constitutional position. Greeks of course would take opposite
                            stand. In this situation posture and actions of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could have determining effect. We believe plan proposed
                            by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> in February still has
                            merit, but will be glad to hear any alternatives British may wish to put
                            forward. In any case, we hope British studying this contingency
                            carefully, for if Turks move it is clear US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will need to set their courses fast and to lead their
                            public attitudes appropriately. US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            must obviously stay in close consultation.</p>
                        <p>We are also looking urgently at possible Soviet actions in event of
                            military operations over Cyprus, and hope British are doing same. Role
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> also needs study.</p>
                        <p>More immediate question is impact of return of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to island. We assume British
                            will be extremely agitated; British EmbOff suggested today <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might even withdraw contingent from
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>. We appreciate <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>' presence reopens old wounds
                            and we know how sensitive British public is to his earlier role.
                            However, relationships have changed and it is conceivable <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> could impose more discipline on
                            Greek Cypriot irregulars, correct slide toward Soviets, extend hand of
                            friendship to Turks and protect them from Greek Cypriot extremists, and
                            actually contribute to solution of British difficulties on island.
                            However this may be, it is going to be hard enough—yet essential—to calm
                            down Turkish fears of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and
                            to forestall any rash Turkish reaction. It is equally essential that
                            British not let appearance of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> upset our careful preparations to bring <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Papandreou to effective
                            substantive talks. Do try to persuade them of this.</p>

                        <p>The President welcomed Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and thanked him for coming to Washington to
                            discuss Cyprus and the Greek-Turkish dispute. <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0185"/>The President said these questions have
                            been of great concern to the United States and although the United
                            States does not have ready answers for the many problems of the world,
                            it is the responsibility of statesmen to meet and seek ways to find
                            solutions.</p>
                        <p>As for Cyprus, the President said we do not have a magic formula to
                            offer, but we are prepared to assist Greece and Turkey in finding a
                            solution. He emphasized it would be unwise to engage in hostilities
                            before making every effort to settle the dispute peacefully. He said
                            that with this in mind, we are ready to make available the services of
                            former Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                                Acheson</persName> to sit down with Greek and Turkish
                            representatives for quiet and frank talks at Camp David. The President
                            was hopeful that such talks could narrow the gap between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> replied that
                            these talks could make possible an exchange of opinions and that in
                            principle he had no objections to the President's kind offer.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the
                            talks would be most effective if each country sent a highly responsible
                            official short of the most senior ranks, but still a man holding the
                            complete confidence of his Prime Minister. He said that the
                            participation of responsible and trusted officials below the Foreign
                            Minister level and the use of the special facilities afforded by Camp
                            David would make it much easier to keep the talks completely secret.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that the two
                            Foreign Ministers might join the talks at a later date.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asked when the talks could begin, and the President
                            replied the sooner the better, perhaps within one week. Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> each expressed some optimism that
                            the talks might quickly help clear the air.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> again
                            expressed his thanks for the President's help, but added that every time
                            during recent months when there had seemed to be hope for a peaceful
                            settlement, something had developed to block it. He said the President
                            should know that he may have to overcome resistance on the Greek side to
                            the proposed talks. He agreed with the President that there are no
                            gainers in war, but pointed out that Greece appears to be acting under
                            the impression that it can win an easy victory on Cyprus. The Prime
                            Minister said if there is to be a solution satisfactory to both sides,
                            Prime Minister Papandreou must decide that he wants one.</p>
                        <p>The President commented he had no illusions that his talks with the
                            Greeks would be easy, but he would do his best.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> raised the
                            subject of the Turkish-Cypriot refugees, now homeless and unable to
                            return to their old villages. He suggested settling the refugees in new
                            homes where they are now. Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the Greeks might interpret such a move as de
                            facto partition, thus making the situation more difficult. He pointed
                            out that the International Red Cross could help in the immediate
                            problems of the <pb n="148" xml:id="pg_148" facs="0186"/>refugees, and
                            said the United States would view such assistance with sympathy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we may have a new
                            asset on Cyprus in the person of General <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName>, the new commander of the
                            United Nations force on the island.<note n="2" xml:id="d72fn2">On June
                                20, Secretary-General Thant announced that <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> would replace
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> as commander of

                                July 8.</note> The Prime Minister said similar sentiments had been
                            expressed when General <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> was
                            appointed to the same position.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said the
                            Cyprus situation would become serious indeed should the Turkish army
                            contingent on the island be attacked. The President assured the Turkish
                            officials he would do his utmost to persuade the Greek Prime Minister
                            that the issues must be settled peacefully and that Mr. Papandreou
                            should use his influence to maintain tranquility on the island.</p>
                        <p>The President concluded by saying that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would be present at Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s luncheon the following
                            day and that further details on the proposed talks could be discussed
                            then.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> opened the main
                            conversation by saying that the United States did not want to put
                            forward a formal solution for the Cyprus problem <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0187"/>but to start by identifying the
                            elements of a possible solution. The Turks, he said think that double
                            enosis would be the best answer whereas the Greeks think that enosis is
                            the solution. For the United States to say now that either of these or
                            certain modifications of either was to be preferred would not be useful.
                            He hoped that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            could push matters forward during the anticipated detailed discussions
                            to come later and that at some time in the future we might then decide
                            to propose something specific to the parties.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> said he did not
                            consider that these discussions should be regarded as a “lawyer's
                            dispute”. There was no sense in simply trying to score points on each
                            other. This was not the way to make progress. Rather, it would be wiser
                            to explore separately the vital elements which each country had at stake
                            in this issue. For example, Turkey seemed to have three major
                            concerns:</p>
                        <p>1) Turkey's national dignity and prestige;</p>
                        <p>2) Turkey's physical security, the question of the degree to which Cyprus
                            in unfriendly hands would be a menace to Turkey;</p>
                        <p>3) The welfare of the Turkish Cypriots, the security of their lives and
                            property. (He remarked that when the crisis arose this last concern had
                            seemed to be Turkey's principal worry, but he thought now it had receded
                            into third place.)</p>
                        <p>Similarly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would
                            propose to ask the Greeks to consider what was vital to their national
                            interests, not merely what they would like to have. After doing this
                            with both parties, he would propose that they try to develop a solution
                            from these bases, instead of starting with broad concepts like enosis
                            and double enosis. After these first steps, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> suggested all concerned
                            must decide how to handle Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and the Cypriots, who were somewhat less than
                            responsible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">Dr. Nihat Erim, Chairman of the Foreign
                                Relations Committee of the Turkish National Assembly.</note>
                            commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s
                            proposed method was a rational approach to a final solution but that the
                            question remained how to preserve security on the Island until a
                            solution could be reached. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that a condition to the talks must be that
                            both Ankara and Athens would exert every effort to keep things quiet on
                            the Island. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> added
                            that he hoped the discussions would be very short and the security
                            problem would not be with us for long. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said we could not count on a quick solution, to
                            which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that we
                            must not start with the expectation that the talks would be protracted,
                                <pb n="150" xml:id="pg_150" facs="0188"/>the situation was too
                            urgent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> foresaw three
                            problems during the talks:</p>
                        <p>1) Maintenance of security on the Island; </p>
                        <p>2) Possible disruptive activities by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>;</p>
                        <p>3) Possible Communist activity.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we must hurry things along. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> concurred heartily,
                            stressing that the present state of affairs would not permit long
                            negotiations of the type which eventually resulted in the Austrian State
                            Treaty; the situation was too explosive. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> interjected that even next week
                            we might have a moral collapse of Turkish Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that we would like
                            to have the talks begin right after July 4th. There was no dissent. He
                            also suggested that Camp David would be the best site for the talks.
                            Again there was no dissent.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> urged that we try to make
                            sure the Greeks don't leak news of our plan to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we would do our best but
                            could not guarantee anything.</p>
                        <p>At various times during the conversation, Turkish representatives voiced
                            special concern not only about the general prospect for security on the
                            Island but also about the situation of the displaced Turkish Cypriots
                            who had left their homes. They asserted that relief for these people had
                            been inadequate and that they were living in a state of dire need.
                            Further, the British relief agencies would be withdrawing from the
                            picture at the end of this month. The American side expressed belief
                            that the International Red Cross would carry forward. The Turks
                            expressed doubts on this and pointed out that the IRC can work only
                            through the local government; if the local government were not willing
                            to cooperate, nothing would be done. The American side gave general
                            assurances of support for the relief effort.</p>
                        <p>The Turks further asserted that the Greek-Cypriot authorities were
                            threatening to prevent the resupplying of the Turkish Army contingents
                            on Cyprus and that this unit would soon exhaust its present stocks. They
                            asked for American help on this problem, which was promised.</p>
                        <p>Most of the balance of the discussion was concerned with the wording of
                            the joint communiqué. The text of the final draft as issued is

                        <p>At one point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked how
                            the Turks interpreted the return of General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> commented that it was not a good sign from a
                            Turkish point of view, and others made similar remarks, but there <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0189"/>was no noticeable excitement or
                            special disturbance on the part of the Turks.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The conversation confirmed agreement on
                            the following points:</p>
                        <p>1) Provided the Greek Government also agreed, Turkey would participate in
                            secret talks with the Greeks and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> directed toward agreement on a final and
                            permanent solution of the Cyprus dispute.</p>
                        <p>2) These talks should begin at Camp David promptly after July 4th.</p>
                        <p>3) The Turkish representative would be Dr. Nihat Erim. (Dr. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> remarked that he was scheduled to
                            come to the United States later this summer on a leader grant and that
                            this could be given as the reason for his return here when he came for
                            the talks.)</p>
                        <p>4) In the meantime, the United States would do its best to assist in
                            assuring the welfare of the Turkish-Cypriot refugees.</p>

                        <p>The President welcomed the Prime Minister for a discussion of a matter
                            which he knew was of deep concern to both of them. The President stated
                            that he had no desire to impose our will on anyone; we have <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0190"/>no formula. However, he is worried that
                            our friends differ among themselves, and he hopes very much that, rather
                            than fighting, they can get together for talks which will lead to a
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>The President referred to the recent threatened move by Turkey and the
                            action he had taken in an effort to forestall it, saying that he was
                            following the teaching of Isaiah: “Come let us reason together”. The
                            President had asked the Turks not to act without talking with us and
                            with Greece. After an exchange of communications, Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had agreed to come to
                            Washington for talks.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to say that he had not presented to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> any formula or recommendation re a
                            particular solution but that he had urged as strongly as possible that
                            the Turks sit down and reason with the people of Greece. The President
                            stressed that statesmen should get together and reason. He had told
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that if the Turks would
                            agree to talk with the Greeks, the United States would provide the
                            arrangements and facilities, including an outstanding American citizen,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean Acheson</persName>, to
                            assist.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he knew that Prime Minister Papandreou felt very
                            strongly in the matter of Cyprus—that he knew the Prime Minister's
                            viewpoint, and that Papandreou felt justified in it. The President
                            added, however, that he hoped very much that Mr. Papandreou would agree
                            that discussions be held with the Turks. He specified that he was not
                            proposing talks on the Prime Minister or even Foreign Minister levels,
                            but rather between duly authorized representatives of the two countries.
                            He felt that the meetings should be secret and should be held in the
                            immediate future, and he suggested they be held with the assistance of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean Acheson</persName> at Camp
                            David. The Prime Minister indicated that he had a high regard for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that the Secretary General of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> wanted the United States to help, in
                            fact, he was anxious for us to do it within the spirit of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. There was no proposal to go around the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President said to Papandreou that he had told <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that he wanted history to remember
                            him as a statesman who would reason and not as a warrior. While
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had accepted this line
                            of argument, the President did not know how long <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> could keep his people behind
                            him.</p>
                        <p>If the Prime Minister of Greece could designate someone who has his
                            confidence who could meet with the Turkish representative and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> was sure that this
                            could be arranged very quickly. There was everything to gain and nothing
                            to lose by trying to reason. The alternative could be very bad and
                            bloody, and we would want no part of it; we cannot be in a position of
                            fighting our allies. The President went on to say that we have exercised
                            our very best efforts to prevent a disaster. He pointed out that anyone
                            can start a war, but confidence, <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0191"/>patience and wisdom were needed to prevent one. He said, therefore, he
                            wanted to have meetings started during the next week and he was sure
                            that all people would welcome this. He emphasized that he was not asking
                            that anyone yield any right, but only that they try to reason.</p>
                        <p>The President then referred to the vote which had just taken place on the
                            foreign aid bill<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">On June 10, the House of
                                Representatives passed H.R. 11380, the 1965 Foreign Aid
                                Appropriations bill, by a vote of 230 to 175. The bill authorized a
                                total of $2 billion in assistance.</note> and said that he could
                            lead the American people if the people think he is doing all possible to
                            prevent bloodshed and work with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.
                            But the people are worried about growing tensions between Greece and
                            Turkey and they do not want this to continue. He was sure that if we
                            three try to reason this matter out, it will help a great deal.</p>
                        <p>He said to Papandreou that if the latter would cooperate and search for
                            peace, he will have the approbation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and of the people of this country; the alternative is
                            too horrible to contemplate. If we cannot cooperate in this search for
                            peace, the President will have to tell the American people what to
                            expect, and he added again we cannot be in a position of fighting an
                            ally. Under the circumstances, the President said what we want to ask is
                            that talks be held in search of a solution and we do not think that this
                            is an unreasonable request. He expressed the hope that before July 4 he
                            could get <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> to designate a
                            representative and Papandreou to do likewise. They, with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, could explore the roads to
                            a solution.</p>
                        <p>The President continued that, with the help of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, we can develop plans which
                            will help both our allies down the years and he then referred to the
                            need for economic development of both countries instead of wasting their
                            resources. The President ended by saying that if the American
                            representative recommends a plan for promoting peace and prosperity, he
                            was sure the American people would follow along.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister then spoke. He said that we were before a very
                            critical situation and we needed to avoid war. He wanted to explore what
                            was the best procedure, for he thought that there was confusion between
                            what we called absolute and relative questions.</p>
                        <p>He said that the two world wars could have been prevented if the leaders
                            of those times had acted properly. He said that for this reason he
                            expressed great appreciation for President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s interest in the Cyprus matter.</p>
                        <p>On the question of procedure, Papandreou asserted that the procedure
                            suggested by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                            would lead to war—“if an understanding does not come about through Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, war will
                            result”. He also asserted that we all have a common aim of avoiding war
                            and this was why he could not accept the viewpoint put forward by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SD2">Stikker</persName>
                            <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0192"/>that when an issue is between
                            two members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> must be neutral. Since the arms of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers are for use against the
                            enemy, is it possible that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would
                            permit their use against an ally?</p>
                        <p> Papandreou stated that the Greeks have responsibility for bringing about
                            peace on the island by influencing the Greek Cypriots; the Turks have a
                            similar responsibility with respect to the Turkish Cypriots. This, he
                            said, was his first point: differences should be settled only through
                            peaceful means.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou went on to say that as the points of view between Turkey and
                            Greece differed so widely, nothing could be expected from the meeting
                            proposed by the President and consequently the extremists on both sides
                            would contend that there was nothing to do but to fight. “When the
                            presupposition is that no war will take place, we can then talk with
                            safety.”</p>
                        <p> Papandreou said that he was prepared to go personally to Cyprus to
                            insure calm and then there would be no excuse for a Turkish landing.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister asserted that he was not thinking just as a leader of
                            Greece but as a leader belonging to a country of the Free World. This
                            led him to the discussion of intervention, saying there were two
                            arguments to be discussed—one legal and one substantive. On the legal
                            side, the right of intervention had been lost when Cyprus entered the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>—there was no longer any basis for
                            intervention. On the substantive side, there was an argument that both
                            the Turks and Greeks must be satisfied. This, he alleged, was false.
                            “Turkey does not lose anything. A century ago it sold Cyprus, so what
                            valid right does it have?” He argued that security was the only basis
                            for negotiation and he agreed that Turkey must be offered security.
                            This, he said, is why he had put forward “NATOfication” as the most
                            desirable solution of the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>He alluded to other possible solutions, saying that in the case of
                            partition, the non-Turkish part of the island would become
                            Communist.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the possibility of Greece giving up something to Turkey as
                            part of a solution, Papandreou said that Greece wanted nothing in
                            Cyprus—its position was “merely that through democratic principles the
                            majority can rule and the minority can be protected.” He put the
                            question “if Greece does not take anything, why should Greece give?” He
                            asserted that the question of enosis was a matter for the Cypriots; that
                            self-determination would be good for Cyprus and for the Free World.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the proposal for a meeting, Papandreou said he was afraid
                            that a confrontation of the two points of view at the present time would
                            lead to war. Instead of this confrontation, talks should be carried on
                            by the Mediator and, meanwhile, peace on the island should be maintained
                            in order to avoid provocation.</p>
                        <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0193"/>
                        <p> Papandreou then repeated his argument that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should not permit <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-furnished arms to be used by either Turkey or Greece
                            to fight one another.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou concluded by expressing the view that if the meeting should
                            be held with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, the
                            latter would have to report no agreement at the end of ten days.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> asked why Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would have to
                            report no agreement if the two parties entered the discussions in good
                            faith.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> interjected here to say
                            that we cannot be sure that the Turks will not move. He suggested that
                            we explore this whole matter further at luncheon.</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> referred to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s proposal of
                            that morning that Greek and Turkish representatives meet quietly with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean Acheson</persName> to try to
                            arrive at some agreement on the main issues in <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0194"/>the Cyprus crisis.<note n="2" xml:id="d75fn2">See <ref target="#d74">Document 74</ref>.</note> In
                            making this suggestion, the President did not intend that the U.S.
                            replace the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediator. Rather, the
                            mediator himself had realized he had come to an impasse and asked us to
                            use our good offices. The U.S. agrees with the Prime Minister's remark
                            that a breakdown of these proposed talks would lead to a dangerous
                            situation, but we are also convinced that serious danger exists now, and
                            so negotiations are essential.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued that there are
                            two elements in the problem: (1) to negotiate a just solution and (2) to
                            do so in a way which will prevent irresponsible forces from taking over
                            Cyprus. He said Greece and Turkey are thinking along the same lines; and
                            so now is the time to talk about procedures which serve everyone's
                            interests. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> added that
                            the day before the Americans had taken a strong line with Turkish Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. Turkey now
                            recognizes that a new basis for Cyprus must be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister commented that the first requirement is security on
                            Cyprus. Greece is trying to establish security; Turkey must try also. He
                            said the Cypriots must then have an opportunity to exercise
                            self-determination. Under any final arrangements, there would of course
                            be guarantees for the Turk-Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> needs a new
                            principle: no member has the right to begin war against another. He
                            continued that Turkey's former right of intervention is not valid now
                            that Cyprus is covered by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter.
                            If there is no danger to the Turk-Cypriot community, then Turkey's
                            argument on the need to intervene collapses. As for solutions, Turkey
                            suggests partition or federation, neither of which is anyone's interest,
                            including Turkey's. The Prime Minister said partition would lead the
                            non-Turkish part of the island into becoming another Cuba, and thus a
                            grave danger to Turkey's security. The other proposal, federation, would
                            lead to civil war. The Prime Minister concluded that the only possible
                            solution is unrestricted independence. This would be followed by a
                            plebiscite and enosis, a solution which is certainly in the free world's
                            interests. Turkey would lose nothing and would in fact gain security.
                            The Turkish-Cypriots would be protected just as are the Thracian Turks
                            now. Prime Minister Papandreou said Greece would also be willing to
                            offer international guarantees for the Turkish minority. The Cyprus
                            crisis had now moved into the context of East-West rivalries, and the
                            Prime Minister said he could not always exclude contacts by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> with the USSR.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that he must
                            question the Prime Minister's statement that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should oppose war between two members. He said he <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0195"/>was certain that no <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country would oppose Turkey if it
                            tried to enforce its treaty rights on Cyprus. As for the United States,
                            the President had said in the morning we would not fight an ally in a
                            situation as complicated as this. The Under Secretary said we will not
                            interpose the Sixth Fleet. The U.S. would certainly attempt to dissuade
                            Turkey, but not by the use of force. With this background, he concluded,
                            it is obvious that the talks as suggested by President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> are essential to avert danger
                            and permit the mediator to get on with his work.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Papandreou said that this line of thinking leaves no
                            conclusion but war. In a conflict between the old agreements and
                            unrestricted independence, there is no bridge. Sooner or later Turkey
                            will go to war, although he said he would be happy if his pessimism were
                            shown to be unfounded. Turkey is too weak now to bridge this gap, and so
                            there is no need for the Prime Minister to meet with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>. Rather the better approach would
                            be to wait for the mediator's report. Perhaps by the process of
                            elimination and with the passage of time, we may find a way. For the
                            moment, the Prime Minister said he thought Greece and Turkey should
                            undertake a reconnaissance to see whether future negotiations are
                            possible; if so, then the real talks might begin.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said it would be a mistake to limit action to keeping
                            the peace on Cyprus while awaiting the mediator's report. We would only
                            be deceiving ourselves, because if there is no progress, we could not
                            expect the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to restrain the activist
                            forces in Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued that what the
                            Prime Minister suggests is an exploration—that is, a Greek
                            representative, Professor <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> of
                            Turkey, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would
                            meet to explore quietly the possibilities of some kind of action and to
                            narrow the differences between the two sides. During that interval,
                            Turkey would attempt to keep the Turk-Cypriots quiet. We would certainly
                            fear the consequences should we have to tell Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that, despite his desisting from
                            military action, we had been unable to arrange any useful
                            alternative.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Papandreou repeated that the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be willing to begin exploratory talks with
                            Turkey. If there appeared to be room for talks he would then appoint
                            someone for real negotiations, but given the present positions of the
                            two Governments, there is little point at present of undertaking actual
                            negotiations. Even though Greece and Turkey may be close now, there must
                            first be cautious preliminary contact.</p>
                        <p>On Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s invitation Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> commented that in
                            insisting that there be peace on Cyprus before serious negotiations, the
                            Prime Minister was raising the old chicken-egg question. He asked
                            whether any pacification is possible until the views of Turkey and
                            Greece are closer than they are now. Mr <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> said no solution can fully satisfy both parties,
                            but what is important is maintaining peace. He said the Prime Minister
                            speaks of principles and theory, but as Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0196"/>grows older, he believes more
                            and more that general principles do not decide specific cases. The Prime
                            Minister's suggestion would place the talks in too narrow a framework.
                            There must be more room for flexibility.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister replied that in this case the principle comes from a
                            concrete case on which he had generalized. The point is, he said, that
                            if the impression is given that negotiations are underway and they then
                            fail, there would certainly be trouble. So there must be a
                            reconnaissance first. He said he defended the principle of
                            self-determination. If he did not, the Greek-Cypriots would follow their
                            own way, and he could not influence them. If the United States thinks
                            negotiations are possible, does it have an opinion about a final
                            solution?</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary replied that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had asked a similar question and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>'s answer now would be
                            the same: any <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>-sponsored solution
                            would be condemned to failure. But in the course of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s talks he could evoke
                            certain points of view, and he might then be able to say that A is
                            better than B. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> turned to
                            self-determination, saying that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            had long advanced such an approach to international problems, but, in
                            looking at Cyprus, there are a number of elements of which
                            self-determination is only one. He said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would try to identify all
                            of the elements on each side. If we do not do something, America's
                            influence over the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would rapidly
                            dissipate, and the consequences could be terrifying. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> are here to discuss these
                            possible consequences.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister said the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has great
                            esteem for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and
                            accepts in principle his offer to make contacts on both sides. If, after
                            these contacts, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            thinks actual negotiations would be useful, then the Prime Minister
                            would appoint a representative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> said there are
                            several elements immediately obvious. One is that of prestige and
                            dignity. No solution can humiliate either side; nor can it be a complete
                            victory for either side. Secondly, is the question of security, which
                            concerns Turkey more than Greece. Therefore, the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> should be sympathetic on this issue. Next come the
                            people of Cyprus. The Prime Minister has said this element is more
                            important to Greece, but actually it is also important to Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Papandreou said he was glad Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> had included the Cypriot
                            people in his listing. The greatest weight must be given to that
                            element—its rights to a majority decision and its right to appeal to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said he also agreed that the
                            security element is more significant for Turkey. He continued, however,
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> must be
                            aware that the Greek starting position for any negotiations is
                            unrestricted independence for Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that this would
                            be a negotiation beginning with the conclusion and, therefore, would not
                            be a negotiation at all.</p>
                        <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0197"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> said the purpose
                            of two-party negotiations is not to take an unchangeable stand, but
                            rather to see what can be accomplished. If the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> sticks to its position, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will not change its views about the binding validity of
                            the present treaties and Turkey's resulting right of intervention.</p>
                        <p>Prime Minister Papandreou insisted that there is no alternative to
                            unrestricted independence. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that he agrees the present system on Cyprus
                            has not worked. We must search for others. There are dangerous forces at
                            work, and we must be practical; as the President said during the morning
                            meeting, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot make moral
                            judgements on this crisis. We are in a grey area in which neither
                            Cypriot community has met 20th Century moral standards. The only choice
                            is a compromise solution.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister concluded that he had expressed his views and heard
                            those of the Americans. He would give his reply to their proposals
                            before leaving Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d75fn3">For text of the

                                <persName corresp="#p_CH1">Cleveland</persName>) outlined upshot of
                            Washington conversations with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Papandreou, and asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> would be prepared to ask Greek
                            and Turkish Governments to appoint representatives to assist him, ask
                            the United States to provide someone to help, and arrange private
                            Greek-Turkish talks as part of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            mediation framework.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> said he personally
                            considered this “a practical approach”, but as “<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> man”, he had to consider following angles and discuss
                            them with the Secretary General:</p>
                        <p>(a) He saw no difficulty in his asking Greek and Turkish Governments
                            provide representatives to assist him in finding a permanent
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>(b) He thought something would have to be done to cut the Cypriots in. He
                            was clear they should not be in the Greek-Turkish meetings as such, but
                            should perhaps be available somewhere nearby so that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> could keep in consultation
                            with the Government of Cyprus. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> made clear he regarded this as window dressing
                            at this stage.</p>
                        <p>(c) He did not like Camp David as a site, preferring somewhere in
                            Switzerland. Recognizing that Geneva is quite accessible to daily
                            contact with the press, he mentioned Lausanne or Evian as
                            possibilities.</p>
                        <p>(d) He found most difficulty with his designating an American to help him
                            or asking the United States Government to do so. He clearly thought this
                            would produce considerable political heat from the Russians, Cypriots
                            and others, and wanted to consider with the Secretary General how much
                            of this kind of heat the United Nations could properly take.</p>
                        <p>On the substance of the solution, he said in his opinion “only basis is
                            enosis”, with whatever compensation is necessary to make it palatable to
                            the Turks. But he also commented that the “<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> solution”, which he defined as unrestricted
                            independence leading rapidly to enosis, would not be so bad.</p>
                        <p>He was not surprised to learn that the Turks were relatively easy to deal
                            with in Washington, while the Greeks were making difficulties. The Turks
                            are in “very weak” position, unless they play their ultimate card. The
                            Greeks naturally believe that the United States will prevent the Turks
                            playing that card; counting on the United States, therefore the Greeks
                            feel that they “have it their own way.”</p>

                        <p>A meeting of the same Americans with the Secretary General (also
                                <persName corresp="#p_BR1">Bunche</persName> and Rolz-Bennett)
                            followed:</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary opened with a summary of the events since February as
                            the United States sees them, stressing the Turkish threats, and Turkish
                            “bitterness and frustration” when dissuaded from action by the United
                            States. The United States had decided we could help best by having the
                            Greeks and Turks get together with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean Acheson</persName> at a private retreat such as Camp
                            David.</p>
                        <p>The Turks had agreed, but the Greeks evidently found difficulties with
                            this proposition. Papandreou had made strong domestic commitments that
                            he would not talk with the Turks under US pressure; and the Greeks
                            anyway think time is on their side. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said the United States had made clear we would not
                            fight an ally (“You couldn't sink Turkish ships,” commented U Thant);
                            the Under Secretary added that our influence in Ankara might prove a
                            wasting asset.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the Papandreou discussions in Washington, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said, the Greeks agreed that they
                            would do anything the Mediator asks them to do, including designating
                            representatives or even meeting jointly with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> if the Mediator requests
                            it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then reported on our
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>. The
                            Secretary General said <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>
                            had also meanwhile reported to him.</p>
                        <p>The points the Secretary General made in reply were these:</p>
                        <p>(a) The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator is competent to adopt
                            whatever procedures he wishes, but asked the Secretary General for
                            political advice on US suggestions.</p>
                        <p>(b) The Secretary General and <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> have agreed that it would be useful to ask
                            Greek and Turkish Governments to provide representatives to assist in
                            finding a permanent solution.</p>
                        <p>(c) The resulting discussions should probably be in Geneva rather than in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>(d) The Secretary General thought that any formula for designating Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> as counsel to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator would create difficulties
                            under the Security Council Resolution of March 4th.</p>
                        <p>(e) The Secretary General's counterproposal was that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> would invite the Turks and the
                            Greeks to designate representatives to meet with him in or near Geneva,
                            on the understanding that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> was also free to consult with a representative
                            of the United States (<persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                                Acheson</persName>). Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> could be close by and in frequent touch with the
                            Mediator as conversations proceeded.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said in his judgment the contribution of the United
                            States would not be worth anything on this basis, and a lengthy
                            discussion followed.</p>
                        <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0200"/>
                        <p>The Secretary General made clear that he did believe “the United States
                            is in the best position to contribute to a peaceful solution of this
                            problem” and that it would be useful for the United States to be
                            constructively related to the mediation process. But he was sure that if
                            the United Nations served as cover for United States participation, it
                            would make great difficulties for the Secretary General under the
                            Security Council Resolution. His point was that the Security Council
                            Resolution provides for appointment of a Mediator with the consent of
                            all four governments concerned (Turkey, Greece, the United Kingdom and
                            Cyprus). If Cyprus, or any of the others decided that the Mediator was
                            operating in an unsatisfactory manner, and so declared to the Secretary
                            General, U Thant said he would have no alternative but to terminate
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s services and get
                            another mediator.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General also argued that the presence of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> as a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representative would increase likelihood Cypriots would
                            want to be represented too and he predicted the Soviets would ask for a
                            Security Council meeting to complain of manner in which the Secretary
                            General was discharging his responsibility under March 4 Resolution.
                            Some political risk was acceptable, but as Ralph Bunche put it, the risk
                            was too high if the Mediator provided cover for a US operation. “Perhaps
                            the mediator is expendable but the Secretary General is not.”</p>
                        <p>In the course of this discussion, the Secretary General and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BR1">Bunche</persName> came around to a somewhat more
                            flexible proposal, under which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, operating not as <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> counsel but as a representative of the United States
                            Government, would meet not only with <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> but also with the Greeks and Turks, together or
                            separately as seemed most useful. But such meetings would have to be
                            worked out on spot with the Greeks and the Turks rather than taking
                            place under the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator's direct
                            sponsorship.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General seemed not to share fully our sense of urgency in a
                            quick solution, though Ralph Bunche commented at one point that the
                            United Nations Force in Cyprus is in an increasingly untenable position,
                            with the continuing inflow of arms and growing bitterness between the
                            two ethnic groups.</p>
                        <p>In the course of discussions, the Under Secretary mentioned that the
                            Mediator had made known to the Turks his personal view that a likely
                            permanent solution was enosis with Greece. This was clearly news to both
                            the Secretary General and <persName corresp="#p_BR1">Bunche</persName>,
                            who said this had not been included in any report by the Mediator; they
                            could fully understand the dangerous effect of such comments by a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator on sensitive Turkish nerves. The
                            Under Secretary made clear that the United States has no position on an
                            ultimate solution, but doubted that any straight enosis recommendation
                            by the Mediator was a useful starting-point for the substantive
                            discussions.</p>

                        <p rend="center">III.</p>
                        <p>After luncheon for Prime Minister Papandreou, the Secretary General
                            informed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> of the
                            substance of his conversation with the Prime Minister before lunch, as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p> Papandreou had said he is entirely willing, if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator so requests, to designate a
                            Representative to meet with a Turkish Representative and with <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> at any time. If meeting is to
                            take place in New York, the Prime Minister would designate the Greek
                            Permanent Representative to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>. The Secretary
                            General replied that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>
                            would be making his headquarters for the time being in Geneva and the
                            meetings could be held there.</p>
                        <p>When the Secretary General raised question of the presence of a United
                            States Representative at these meetings, Prime Minister Papandreou
                            replied he would not wish a US Representative to be formally designated
                            by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> as advisor or
                            counsel or to take part in meetings of Greeks and Turks chaired by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>. When the Secretary
                            General proposed, however, that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                                Acheson</persName> as US Representative might be available in
                            Geneva, “even in next room or in next building”, to meet separately with
                            mediator, and with Greek and Turkish Representatives, in order assist in
                            search for settlement, Prime Minister Papandreou replied that this would
                            be entirely agreeable to him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary General commented that this seemed to him a reasonable
                            arrangement which should take account of our views and needs without
                            risking the kinds of difficulties which he had outlined to us this
                            morning. He added that Prime Minister Papandreou and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> were at that moment discussing
                            details of the proposed arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName>
                            called Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> who said he
                            had reached agreement with Prime Minister Papandreou along the lines the
                            Secretary General had described, and would be addressing to the United
                            States about July 6 an invitation to send a representative to Geneva to
                            be available for consultation. He has in mind himself proceeding to
                            Geneva from Cyprus July 4, and opening the meeting with Greeks and Turks
                            early the following week. He would keep closely in touch with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, and believed the
                            Greeks and the Turks would do likewise.</p>
                        <p>He said he plans to hold conversations with the Greeks and the Turks at
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> headquarters in Geneva (the Palais
                            des Nations) but that meetings with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> might take place wherever convenient to all
                            concerned. He was confident of his ability to carry on negotiations
                            without undue press interference and did not contemplate any
                            announcement to the press of the proposed Greek-Turkish talks until they
                            actually begin. He did not intend before July 6 to address formal
                            invitation to Greeks and Turks to meet with him.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> emphasized the
                            importance of extending an invitation to the Turks promptly so that they
                            would know that the <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0202"/>desired
                            negotiations are about to commence and would hence be more likely to
                            refrain from any hazardous action. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> saw the point and said that, after consultation
                            with his <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> colleagues, he would either
                            address formal invitations to the Greeks and the Turks right away, or
                            else would issue statement to the press announcing that he intends to
                            extend such an invitation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is clear that the Secretary General
                            cannot be pushed to provide United Nations sponsorship for mediation
                            between the Greeks and the Turks essentially conducted by the United
                            States. However, we must apply a sufficient proportion of US persuasion
                            to a mediation process set up by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Mediator. Sine qua non is therefore that we make sure that all parties
                            concerned at this stage (Greeks, Turks, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>)
                            understand need for, and welcome, day-to-day discussions with US
                            representative at or near the scene of mediation talks.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> called on Prime Minister
                            Papandreou to confirm and pull together the results of several
                            discussions earlier in the day that had involved the Greek Prime
                            Minister's party, the Secretary General of the United Nations, the
                            United Nations Mediator, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and his colleagues. The Prime Minister was
                            extremely tired. Three hours earlier he had cancelled a talk at the
                            Council on Foreign Relations. He was cheerful, however. He felt he had
                            reached a “perfect understanding” with the mediator, and could leave the
                            United States having overcome the “mood of dispute” that characterized
                            his Washington talks. Nevertheless, when pressed on details of the
                            proposed arrangements, he continued to resist firmly all suggestions
                            that the Greek and United States Governments could, if necessary, agree
                            together to involve an American representative in the Cyprus
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>Observing that the Prime Minister had had a busy day in New York, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked how he now saw the
                            situation. The Prime Minister replied that happily he and the mediator,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>, had reached
                            total agreement. The mediator would be in Geneva and Mr. Papandreou
                            would name a representative to meet with him. After that the mediator
                            would have the total initiative; whatever he asked, Mr. Papandreou would
                            accept. The meeting with the Secretary General, on the other hand, had
                            been rather more difficult. In passing, U Thant had said that all people
                            were speaking to him today about <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                                Acheson</persName>. The Secretary General believed an impression of
                            conspiracy would develop if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> were brought directly into the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that in considering
                            possible arrangements we had been sensitive to the political problems of
                            the Prime Minister. We wanted to see a satisfactory solution. As he
                            understood the agreed plan, the mediator would invite Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> to Geneva and suggest to
                            the Greek and Turkish representatives who would be there that there be
                            some talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            as well. The Prime Minister said the mediator had not told him Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would see the
                            representatives independently of himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH1">Cleveland</persName> noted that we had understood from Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> that he would prefer
                            not to have four-way meetings. The mediator would meet with
                            representatives of Greece and Turkey, and he expected that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would do so also. The Prime
                            Minister said he had understood the essence of the mediator's position
                            to be that at the first stage any meetings with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> should be bilateral and not
                            with the Greeks and Turks present together. The Greek and Turkish
                            representatives would not meet together unless their Governments
                            specifically agreed on that. However, he respected totally the
                            initiative of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we probably had the
                            basis for the beginning of some talks. Success would depend on the will
                            of the parties. Knowing it would not be easy, we were prepared to be
                            helpful in any way we could. The <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0204"/>Prime Minister expressed pleasure that we were now in agreement. He
                            was also grateful for the initiative that had been taken by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Greece needs peace,
                            and for this it needs a final objective solution of the Cyprus
                            dispute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that meanwhile
                            we had received disturbing reports about conditions on the island
                            itself. The Prime Minister replied that on those matters he would use
                            all of his influence. We could count on that. He had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> that as soon as the mediator's
                            request arrived he would send a representative immediately to Geneva.
                            The Prime Minister added that he was happy that we could meet today to
                            show a change in the atmosphere to one of friendship and understanding
                            rather than dispute.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister reiterated that so long as the mediator suggested a
                            meeting between the Greek representative and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> it would be done. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> concluded that this
                            formula should help move things along if the parties so desired. Mr
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> asked hypothetically
                            what would be the situation if the mediator invited Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> to Geneva but for one
                            reason or another was shy about specifically asking the Greek and
                            Turkish representatives to meet with him. There would be a general
                            invitation but from what the Secretary General had said in the morning
                            it was conceivable that the mediator would hesitate to make a formal
                            request of the parties to meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said that if something like this should happen he
                            assumed our two governments could work things out together. The Prime
                            Minister replied that this would change the basic situation. It was
                            essential that the mediator take the initiative. He could send a general
                            invitation to all the parties. Just four men would be involved so there
                            should be no mystery. It would need to be at the mediator's initiative,
                            however.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that we understood
                            the Prime Minister's approach. In a situation like this, of course,
                            people must proceed pragmatically. We would have preferred a simpler
                            situation, but we will work within the practical framework. As the
                            President had said to the Prime Minister, we had been disappointed that
                            we could not work out a more straightforward arrangement. Faced with the
                            dangerous situation in Cyprus, however, we must do all we can. He could
                            assure the Prime Minister that the United States would do everything
                            possible to cooperate. As the Prime Minister had observed, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> was greatly trusted
                            by the Secretary of State and the President and he could speak with an
                            authoritative voice in discussing these matters with the Prime Minister.
                            We would do what we could to get us all out of a very dangerous
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister once again thanked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, expressing his appreciation for the reception that
                            had been given him in Washington, and confirmed that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName>'s many qualities
                            made him a valuable cooperator in Athens. The discussion was left at
                            that point.</p>

                        <p>4651. Re: Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName>,
                            Cleveland and Yost had rather discouraging conversation with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>When told that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> had
                            informed us he intended to dispatch invitation to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to send representative to Geneva to be
                            available during his conversations with Greek and Turkish
                            representatives, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said he had never
                            contemplated that Mediator would go so far and that it would be most
                            unwise politically. He repeated what he had said yesterday that this
                            might provoke withdrawal of confidence in Mediator by Cypriot Govt.</p>
                        <p>He was, however, prepared to advise <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> that, if Acheson comes to Geneva during
                            Greek-Turkish conversations, he would recommend to both parties that
                            they meet separately or collectively with Acheson and express view US
                            could make unique contribution to negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In course of conversation, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> expanded
                            somewhat on his conversation with Papandreou yesterday, reporting that
                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>, while prepared to have his
                            representative meet with Turks and Mediator at latter's request, saw no
                            real use in meeting since he thought both parties would merely repeat
                            known positions. As far as Greece is concerned, he added, Cyprus is
                            independent state and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member, and its
                            only obligation is to decide its future by democratic principles laid
                            down in Charter. Turks must simply accept such settlement, although
                            there can be <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base on Cyprus with
                            Turkish participation and international guarantees for Turkish
                            minority.</p>
                        <p>It was left that <persName corresp="#p_SAE1">Stevenson</persName> would
                            communicate with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> after he meets with
                            Papandreou this evening and that, unless new complications appeared,
                            Thant would communicate with <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> in Helsinki, urging him to dispatch invitations
                            to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> promptly, to get meetings started as soon as possible,
                            and advising him under circumstances described above, he should

                        <p>Incidentally, it was also mentioned that Galo Plaza has informed <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> he intends to leave Cyprus end of first

                            with reference to present delicate situation outlined to me by my old
                            friend Galo Plaza and General <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName>. As in past I was again urging restraint and
                            patience since any dramatic development might well bring on new Turkish
                            move which we might not be in a position stop again.</p>
                        <p>In response <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said first
                            of all we should not read too much into his statement to Associated
                                Press.<note n="4" xml:id="d79fn4">Apparent reference to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' rejection of the U.S.
                                offer to provide assistance to the U.N. Mediator.</note> His purpose
                            had been to avoid possible adverse reaction to “expected failure” of
                            Washington talks, hence his effort to play them down while at same time
                            making clear that any decisions regarding future of Cyprus would have to
                            be submitted to Cypriots and could not be result merely of talks between
                            other countries. Said he quite understood US effort in context of
                            over-all UNSYG attempt to find satisfactory solution but he wondered
                            whether failure of Pres <pb n="169" xml:id="pg_169" facs="0207"/>
                            <persName>Johnson</persName>'s efforts had not perhaps left situation
                            worse than it had been two weeks ago. I told him that although matter
                            would be kept confidential for obvious reason we understood Mediator had
                            some further thoughts regarding possibility of further consultations
                            among parties concerned (I did not mention any US involvement and he
                            would presumably be hearing from Tuomioja upon his return). <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> went on to make surprise
                            statement that in any bilateral talks that might develop with Turkey,
                            Greek Government could only discuss solutions on the basis of enosis of
                            Cyprus with Greece and that any solution other than enosis and/or
                            complete independence could only be reached with participation of
                            Cypriot representatives. (This would seem to explain Papandreou's
                            refusal consider any possible divergences from these two
                            principles.)</p>
                        <p> Archbishop said that both <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_GGPS1">Gyani</persName> had called to impress
                            on him need for patience and restraint but said he had told them that
                            although he would not use armed force that the status quo could not
                            continue indefinitely. He said he had feeling <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would consider its job well done in next three months if
                            it could say that not a shot had been fired. Naturally this was most
                            commendable aim but without some progress on political front basic
                            tensions at least on Greek side could hardly be reduced. Some change
                            would have to come before the end of the year when economic and
                            political pressures would be severe.</p>
                        <p>President went on to say he could understand our apprehension regarding
                            the present tense situation particularly with regard to possible Turkish
                            intervention and all that would imply. Said he could assure me that for
                            their part Greek Cypriots would not use force unless attacked. They were
                            however giving serious consideration to use of other pressures which he
                            had enumerated to me previously and he again said that if freedom of
                            movement not restored in presently Turkish-held areas, his govt would be
                            forced to deny freedom of movement to Turkish Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>I expressed gratification at this indication that Greek Cypriot side
                            would do nothing to create a new crisis through military action and I
                            urged him to give very careful consideration to nature of other
                            pressures which he might feel were required in order not to bring on new
                            danger of Turkish intervention which this time we might find even more
                            difficult if not impossible to prevent. Although I had made it quite
                            clear that US could not contemplate hostilities with an ally over Cyprus
                            problem I am not convinced that Archbishop has accepted this as cold
                            fact of situation.</p>
                        <p>President was more relaxed than during last meeting and seemed much less
                            militant in his declarations of need for progress on political front.
                            Perhaps <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reps plus Greek Amb Delivanis
                            plus our representations have had some effect.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> to Prime
                            Minister:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I want to tell you again how glad I am that we had an opportunity to
                            visit together and to exchange views on the critical problem of Cyprus.
                            I know that the course of the discussion was not altogether easy for
                            either of us, but I am sure that it is of great importance for those of
                            us who bear the responsibility for government within the Western
                            Alliance to talk honestly together on such grave matters. It is out of
                            just such hard work together that we can ensure a high degree of
                            understanding.</p>
                        <p>Over this last weekend I have been thinking some more about our
                            conversation and about the problem of Cyprus, and I think it may be
                            helpful for me to continue our discussion by sending this message to you
                            as you return to Athens.</p>
                        <p>First of all, let me say that the last week has only strengthened my deep
                            conviction that the problem of Cyprus grows more urgent and dangerous
                            with every day that goes by. Until we can get serious negotiations
                            started, we must recognize that time will not work on the side of peace.
                            Right now we are coming near to the last hour. That is why I hope our
                            two Governments can agree in the view that in this very dangerous
                            situation it is absolutely essential that serious and searching talks
                            should be started promptly.</p>
                        <p>I promise you that my conviction that we are at the edge of a crisis is
                            not lightly formed. It rests on two powerful facts: the first is that
                            passion on Cyprus is now intense on both sides, and the second, that the
                            build-up of armaments on the Island continues. This is a condition which
                            is bound to become increasingly explosive; indeed, the build-up of
                            armaments on the Island is already dangerously close to the flash point.
                            And even without an immediate explosion the belief that danger is
                            steadily increasing could at any time create pressures for intervention
                            in Turkey which may prove irresistible. Having prevented such
                            intervention by most strenuous personal efforts last month, I know very
                            well that there is a limit to what any of us can do from now on, to
                            prevent the Turks from exercising rights which are very real indeed to
                            them.</p>
                        <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0209"/>
                        <p>I see only one way in the world to turn the course of events away from
                            this pathway toward disaster, and that is by a prompt and determined
                            search by Greece and Turkey for a permanent political settlement. I
                            recognize that such a joint effort will have some critics and opponents
                            on all sides, and I recognize also the quite understandable belief of
                            many in your country that all that is needed is that the majority of the
                            people of Cyprus should be allowed to settle their own future. But let
                            me urge with all the force I can, that it simply is not enough, in this
                            most dangerous situation, to have a belief in the rightness of one's own
                            argument. The pressures on Turkey for action are extremely strong, and
                            they too derive from a deep conviction that Turkish rights are at
                            stake.</p>
                        <p>As I said in our discussions, the United States most earnestly desires to
                            be helpful in the search for a solution, but the United States does not
                            seek to impose any outside view, or to take sides with one of its
                            friends against another. Our conviction is that any successful solution
                            must derive from the agreement of the parties and cannot be dictated or
                            imposed from outside. But we shall be just as helpful as we can to both
                            our friends, once a serious discussion begins.</p>
                        <p>Moved by my sense of the increasing danger of this question, let me say
                            once again, as solemnly as possible, how much I hope that the Government
                            of Greece will be able to join in a prompt and determined effort to seek
                            through negotiation a lasting answer to this perilous problem. It is in
                            this spirit that I hope your representative will be empowered to discuss
                            all aspects of the Cyprus problem with the mediator and the Turkish
                            representative. I hope also that his instructions may be so framed that
                            our American representative will also be able to help in bringing about
                            a settlement. In such discussions, neither side must insist that there
                            is only one acceptable basis for discussion; both sides—and all of us
                            who hope to be helpful—must approach these negotiations with a resolute
                            determination to work out a peaceful answer.</p>
                        <p>Let me say again in closing that I fully recognize your responsibility
                            not only to join in preserving peace but to uphold the principles of
                            your Government and the rights of your people in accordance with your
                            duty as the leader of Greece. You can be sure that the United States, in
                            urging negotiation and in offering help to the mediator, intends no
                            disregard whatever of the rights of Greeks and of Turks in their
                            homelands and on Cyprus. My conviction is simple: that the real
                            interests of the peoples and the real responsibilities of their leaders
                            can be met if there is real negotiation—and that if there is not such
                            negotiation, none of us can prevent a disaster for which all of us will
                            be held accountable.</p>

                            us alone.</p>
                        <p>During reading of President's letter, PriMin's expression was serious
                            even grim. After having read letter he commented, “more of the same.”
                            Everyone in Washington, he said, applied pressure on him to negotiate as
                            though negotiation were the magic formula, but he had not heard one
                            specific suggestion in Washington as to what he is to negotiate about,
                            or what US would consider an acceptable solution. Because of danger of
                            armed Turkish intervention, Greece is urged to make concessions. But
                            what concessions is Greece to make, what rights are Turks giving up
                            which require that they be compensated by Greece. Greece asks nothing
                            from Cyprus. This is not basically a Greek-Turkish problem. There are
                            questions of principle involved, one of which is independence,
                            self-determination and integrity of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>I am told, he said, that I must negotiate because if I do not negotiate
                            the Turks will resort to armed intervention. The US has exhausted its
                            efforts to restrain Turks and responsibility for the peace thus rests
                            upon Greece. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            pointed out to me how powerful Turkish military forces are, but Greece
                            cannot act under pressure of ultimatum. We did not accept an ultimatum
                            from our enemies in 1940,<note n="3" xml:id="d81fn3">Reference is to the
                                Greek Government rejection of an ultimatum from Italy.</note> and it
                            is very difficult for us to accept an ultimatum today from our friends.
                            How can a nation (US) maintain its position as the leader of free world
                            unless it has a policy? How can it fail to continue to support principle
                            of self-determination? How can US fail to say to Turkey—or to Greece for
                            that matter: “the arms which you possess are arms which we have given
                            you for the purpose of self-defense. We (US) will not accept that our
                            arms be used in an aggressive manner, risking the danger of war, perhaps
                            a small war, but one which could escalate into a large war.” How can
                            Greece's <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies fail to tell the
                            Turks that they do not accept aggressive actions which may precipitate a
                            war. Greece can accept a political struggle; Greece can accept debate in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; but Greece cannot accept a policy which justifies the
                            use of force.</p>

                        <p> Papandreou said <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> had
                            agreed that Cypriot right to self-determination must be respected and
                            that Turkish threats of armed intervention were unacceptable. Papandreou
                            gave no intimation that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>
                            may have been alluding to right of both Greek and Turkish Cypriot

                        <p>I replied <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be making a serious
                            error in interpreting Washington's analysis of current situation as an
                            ultimatum, and I asked whether he did not have feeling that although
                            there may be serious differences of view regarding tactics, US and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> were, in fact, moving in same
                            general direction. Prime Minister did not answer directly, but excused
                            himself for bluntness of his statement and promised that he would reply

                        <p>I inquired whether press reports that Nikolareizis (Greek Ambassador to
                            Belgrade) would be sent to Geneva were correct. He confirmed this and
                            added that Nikolareizis arriving in Athens tomorrow to report to him
                            prior to going to Geneva. I said that I was confident that Washington
                            would be very much gratified by his decision to send such an experienced
                            diplomat to Geneva.</p>

                            intervene militarily. Papandreou's Washington visit has probably
                            produced some bruises which will be slow in disappearing. Although he

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> led off the
                            discussion of Cyprus by telling the President he thought it would be
                            useful to report to the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> on a
                            situation which was like a time bomb that could blow up any time in the
                            next six weeks. His report largely reflected the State Department

                        <p>One of the principal problems, he said, is irrationality on both sides.
                            The Greeks figure time is on their side. They think they can work out a
                            plebiscite followed by enosis simply by sitting tight. The threat of
                            Turk invasion has roused their stubbornness and Athens seems blind to
                            its long-range interest in conceding enough to Ankara to provide a basis
                            for improved relations after a Cyprus settlement. The Turks, on the
                            other hand, see their position being eroded day by day. They resent our
                            having restrained them when chances for a successful invasion were best,
                            and they are bitter over Greek and Cypriot disregard of the
                            London-Zurich treaties. They see a political solution as the only
                            alternative to exercising their right of intervention.</p>
                        <p>Pressures are building up, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> went on. The Greeks have sent 4000 troops to the
                            island (<gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believes 5–7000), in
                            addition to their regular garrison there. The Turks, who have to put
                            their men ashore at night from small boats, have sent perhaps 1000 in
                            addition to their garrison. The Turks see the Greek buildup outrunning
                            theirs and their hope of successful intervention vanishing. Meanwhile,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>—a fanatic,
                            fortunately anti-Communist—has taken over the Greek Cypriot forces and
                            hopes to build an army of some 35,000 men. The Turks have a lurking fear
                            that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> may overthrow
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> suddenly and simply
                            announce annexation of Cyprus to Greece. So the pressure on the Turks to
                            act soon is increasing. Moreover, the Turks know of the Greek plan, if
                            the situation drags on through the summer, to throw the whole question
                                <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0213"/>to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> General Assembly where the Greeks are
                            confident they will get a blessing for self-determination leading to
                            enosis. On top of this, incidents could trigger Turk Cypriot rebellion
                            or island-wide fighting at any time.</p>
                        <p>We are staking our bets of necessity on the Geneva talks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> continued. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> has arrived. The
                            arrangements made for him there are not good but are the best we have
                            been able to work out. He had his first talk with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator yesterday and reports an
                            atmosphere of pessimism. However, we hope his further discussions before
                            talks with the Greeks and Turks begin early the week of 13 July may
                            improve the atmosphere. Meanwhile, we are doing extensive contingency
                            planning to limit the scope of a Greek-Turk war if the Turks invade and
                            to keep bloodshed on Cyprus to a minimum. We are also considering how we
                            should handle ourselves in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council and how we might develop safehavens for refugees on the
                            island. On 9 July we are holding a meeting here with the British and
                            Canadians to see what pressure they can bring to bear on the Greeks. We
                            are also studying seriously the problem of evacuating officials and
                            tourists should war break out.</p>
                        <p>At that point the President broke in to ask how many Americans are in the
                            area. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that there
                            are about 250 on Cyprus, mostly with our communications facilities
                            there. Since we went through an evacuation exercise earlier this year,
                            he contemplates little difficulty there.<note n="4" xml:id="d82fn4">In
                                January 1964, the United States evacuated the families of officials
                                working in Cyprus.</note> In Greece there are 5–6000 Americans and
                            in Turkey 16–17,000. However, he felt that danger in the mainland
                            countries of a severe anti-American reaction would not be great.</p>
                        <p>The President then asked whether Papandreou had replied to his letter (of
                            2 July).<note n="5" xml:id="d82fn5">See <ref target="#d80">Document
                                    80</ref>.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            said the reply had just come in and that it was simply a pro forma
                            reiteration of the Greek position and really did not take us
                                anywhere.<note n="6" xml:id="d82fn6">See <ref target="#d82fn4">footnote 4</ref>, Document <ref target="#d81">81</ref>.</note>
                            The President said he wanted to see that letter as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>There followed a detailed briefing by Gen. <persName corresp="#p_BLGD1">Burchinal</persName> on the military forces that would participate
                            in any hostilities on Cyprus. The attached memorandum records the
                            substance of this briefing.<note n="7" xml:id="d82fn7">Not found.</note>
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, at the end of the
                            briefing, highlighted the fact that the Turk goal is limited to
                            establishing a beachhead for bargaining purposes; the Turks do not want
                            the kind of war that complete conquest would require. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> also estimated that perhaps
                            20–25,000 villagers might be slaughtered once an invasion started.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_BLGD1">Burchinal</persName> suggested that
                            Turk air mastery <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0214"/>might prove
                            some deterrent since Greek villages would be vulnerable. No one
                            responded, but the feeling seemed to be that this would only increase
                            the carnage.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized his understanding in these terms: The Turks have
                            substantially greater forces than the Greeks in every respect; they
                            could land and maintain a beachhead; and the Soviets would not
                            intervene. General <persName corresp="#p_BLGD1">Burchinal</persName>
                            confirmed the President's understanding, estimating Turk army
                            superiority at 3–1 and air force at 4–1. [<hi rend="italic">2–1/2 lines

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> elaborated on
                            the President's last point, saying we didn't think the Soviets would
                            intervene militarily but they would unquestionably try to make political
                            hay out of any disorder on Cyprus. General <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wheeler</persName> added that a prime Soviet objective is the
                            fragmentation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and any
                            Greek-Turk hostilities would further that end.</p>
                        <p>The President moved on to the question of what our next steps might be
                            and asked whether there is anything further we can do to prevent Turkish
                            invasion and to assure the success of the Geneva talks. He pointed out
                            that the Greeks didn't expect much to come of these talks and have shown
                            a good deal of irritation at the way we treated them during Papandreou's
                            visit here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt that the President
                            had seriously shaken Papandreou with his statement that the US would not
                            militarily restrain a Turkish invasion. He felt we had gained some
                            ground with the Greeks during that visit. Mr. Bundy felt less
                            optimistic, noting Greek peevishness over the President's latest
                            letter.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that Papandreou had pressed for a US formula when
                            he was here. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out
                            the pitfalls of providing one at the outset of discussions. He said that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> is well prepared
                            to introduce the elements of such a formula in the course of the Geneva
                            talks. However, if we presented a US solution in advance, he felt both
                            parties would attack it and walk out. The President agreed.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> brought up the
                            desirability of using General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> and the North Atlantic Council (<gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss>) to bring home to the Greek and Turk
                            military that a clash between them would be suicidal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> was bearish on this idea
                            because he did not feel the Greek military had much influence over its
                            political leaders. His previous talks with them had netted little.<note n="8" xml:id="d82fn8">See <ref target="#d5">Document 5</ref>.</note>
                            However, the <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> will be meeting 8 July
                            and we expect a strong Canadian challenge to the Greeks based on reports
                            that Greek <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> units and materiel are
                            now on Cyprus. Both Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, however, favored <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0215"/>instructing General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> to go ahead and tell the Turk and Greek
                            military again what we have told the political leaders. While Papandreou
                            seems to have absorbed the President's warning, the military leaders
                            still apparently feel that we will stop a Turk invasion and that no move
                            they make really risks a direct Greek-Turk confrontation.</p>
                        <p>The President asked General <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wheeler</persName> whether we have taken into account the demands
                            that a Turkish invasion would place on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wheeler</persName> felt we had examined the consequences carefully.
                            He was concerned particularly about how the Turks would receive a direct
                            US rebuff. However, he did not feel Turkey would “fall into the Soviet
                            Bloc.” He felt the strength of Greek Communists made Greece potentially
                            very unstable. Ultimately he saw both Greece and Turkey lost to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if hostilities were permitted to go
                            on very long.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General suggested another approach. He asked about the
                            possibility of organizing an effort to explain to influential elements
                            other than the military and government in Greece and Turkey what the
                            situation would be if either country took the steps it is contemplating.
                            In other words, would the Turks like the situation that would exist
                            after they secured a beachhead on Cyprus—carnage in the Turk Cypriot
                            villages, world opinion against them, Greece less willing than ever to
                            negotiate a settlement? Would the Greeks welcome a Turk foothold on
                            Cyprus, the economic disruption of a Greek-Turk war, possibly defeat of
                            Greek forces? Wouldn't there be some deterrent effect in getting across
                            to influential Greeks and Turks an objective analysis of the situation
                            they will have to cope with if they don't negotiate now?</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> whether
                            we could not do this sort of thing through our embassies. He felt that
                            embassy involvement might create a clearer view in Ankara and Athens of
                            our concern. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> felt that
                            it would be very difficult to do anything of this kind publicly because
                            of the irrational atmosphere in both capitals. Anything we do, he said,
                            gives the appearance of our working for the other side. For instance, if
                            we described the terrible consequences of a Greek-Turk war, the Greeks
                            would simply ask why, then, we would refuse to stop a Turk invasion.

                        <p>When the President asked how much of the position we took in the
                            Washington talks has “dribbled down to the Greek and Turk populace”, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that the average
                            Greek thinks we're holding the gun of a Turk invasion at Greek heads to
                            force a deal. The Turks feel that, because we restrained their invasion,
                            we're pro-Greek. So the people have very stereotyped views of our
                            position. In the current hysterical atmosphere, it is very difficult to
                            put across a reasonable explanation of our goals.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> asked whether
                            we couldn't stimulate leading Greek citizens to brief their own press
                            and make it more aware of the consequences of the present course of
                            events. For instance, could we get <pb n="178" xml:id="pg_178" facs="0216"/>Onassis and others of his importance to explain the
                            economic consequences of provoking a Greek-Turk war?<note n="9" xml:id="d82fn9">Documentation relating to subsequent contacts with

                            perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> might have
                            some suggestions to offer.</p>
                        <p>The Attorney General said he did not see any objection to our being
                            associated with such an effort. He felt that we would be talking simply
                            about the facts of a potential situation, not about controversial
                            positions. Mr. Bundy asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> how painful it might be if such a campaign came out
                            of Paris—from <gloss target="#t_NAC1">NAC</gloss> members and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> officers there. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that the farther from
                            Washington the better and pointed out that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General could also do some of this if he
                            would.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy wrapped up this part of the discussion by suggesting to the
                            President that we draw up a program for mounting such a campaign just to
                            see what it looks like. The President instructed him to do so with the
                            help of the agencies involved.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bundy then moved to the problem of how we get the Geneva talks going.
                            He felt that the Greeks could get what they wanted if they would just
                            sit down and talk and asked whether we shouldn't use this argument with
                            them. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he had
                            done just this during his luncheon with Papandreou. However, he pointed
                            out that it is difficult to carry this argument much further than
                            private conversations because the Turks could easily construe it as a
                            US-Greek deal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCJA1">McCone</persName> asked whether the real
                            problem wasn't what the Turks would get out of these talks rather than
                            how we could satisfy the Greeks. He said he hadn't seen any evidence of
                            a formula that would meet Turk needs. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he felt we could put together a package which
                            the Turks would think pretty good if we could once get the two parties
                            together.</p>
                        <p>The President returned to the question of how we might bring pressure to
                            bear on the two governments. He asked Mr. Wilson how seriously concerned
                            the people of each country are about what is going on. Mr. Wilson
                            responded that the people of Turkey particularly are frustrated by their
                            government's inability to act in the current situation and pointed out
                            the danger that such frustration would lead to impulsive action. He did
                            not feel, however, that the people had thought through the consequences
                            of a Turkish invasion. He felt we could draw up a list of people in
                            Paris, Athens, and Ankara who might be useful in creating a more
                            realistic view of the consequences of invasion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> brought the discussion
                            back to Geneva by pointing out that we can't count on the Greeks to act
                            in their own best interests. We <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0217"/>can't rely simply on a campaign to make people aware of the
                            consequences of their action—especially when they are acting
                            irrationally. Therefore, he felt our best hope was in pushing the
                            negotiations in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>The President reacted by saying if we are to succeed there we will need
                            more power than we have had to date. We did our best during the
                            Washington talks to convince both Greeks and Turks to negotiate. Now we
                            are going to make another approach to the Turk military in an effort to
                            get them to throw their weight into the scales on the side of
                            moderation. He saw no reason why we should not explore every way of
                            getting a reasonable view of the situation across to important people in
                            both countries.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the President outlined two courses of action: (a) our
                            military in Paris would make clear to the Greek and Turk military what
                            consequences they could anticipate if either nation moved militarily;
                            (b) we should also draw up a plan for getting this understanding across
                            to as many influential people in both countries as possible.<note n="10" xml:id="d82fn10">Efforts to make the consequences of military action

                            partition line, enclosing whole northern part of island <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0218"/>and went on to give us standard Turkish
                            position: that first Turkish demand was implementation London-Zurich
                            Agreements and that failing this Turkey could only consider partition or
                            federalism. We tried to point out probable impracticality of achieving
                            any of these.</p>
                        <p>I touched on probable great cost to Turkey and Turkish Cypriots of
                            solution which Turks would have to impose by force. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> then took new tack, saying that
                            after all Turkey could let Greece effect enosis as fait accompli,
                            without fighting Greece, but refuse to recognize it and maintain
                            continuing pressures against Greece in hope situation would change for
                            better. I expressed great doubts Turkey's position would improve under
                            such circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Speaking next about Turkey's concern for welfare Turk-Cypriots we
                            broached idea that this might be taken care of without partition and
                            within context of enosis. For example, I said, there could be a Turkish
                            base large enough to be safe haven for those Turks unwilling to live
                            under Greek rule, while for the other Turks a special semi-autonomous
                            regime could be set up. This might comprise one or more areas where
                            Turks were in majority (such as strip from northern Nicosia to Kyrenia)
                            which would be administered directly by Turkish local authorities: for
                            those areas where Turks remained in minority, there might still be
                            arrangement whereby a Turk-Cypriot authority would nevertheless control
                            and administer local affairs of Turkish villagers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> seemed intrigued with this
                            idea and said he would like to think about it. He asked whether
                            base-safe haven area would be sovereign Turkish territory, a part of
                            Turkey. We stretched matter a bit and said yes. He then suggested it
                            would be desirable for a Turkish military expert come here to discuss
                            what would be needed on Cyprus to protect Turkey from military point of
                            view. Proposed to send for General Sunalp. I raised no objection.<note n="3" xml:id="d83fn3">In telegram 96 from Geneva, July 13, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> reported that he had
                                put forward a scheme for a semi-autonomous Turkish area that would
                                not require geographic division. (Department of State, Central

                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> flatly admitted Turks were
                            going to expel Greeks from Turkey at end six-month period following
                            denunciation of treaty as reprisal for Greek policies toward Cypriots.
                            He further strongly indicated that Patriarchate would also be expelled,
                            even though Turk Government had nothing special against Athenagoros. I
                            said that expulsion of Greeks was not sufficient lever to affect Cyprus
                            question at present. It would be more sensible to keep this weapon in
                            reserve to be used in reprisal if Greeks later failed live up to
                            guarantees they might give Turk Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>When we were discussing Turkish security problem, Erim particularly
                            pointed out location of Kastellorizon. I asked if Turkey's security
                            would be improved if it had this island, and he said that it would. At
                                <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0219"/>another juncture, <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> referred to remarks made to him
                            while in Washington that possibly Greek islands of Lesvos, Samos or Kos
                            might be ceded as compensation for Cyprus. We rather threw cold water on
                            this. I do think, however, that his apparent interest in Kastellorizon
                            may have some significance.</p>

                        <p>76. 1. I had long talk with FonMin Costopoulos yesterday on Cyprus
                                situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d84fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> met with King
                                Constantine the same day for discussions on Cyprus. He reported on
                                this meeting in telegram 75 from Athens, July 12. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Reviewing Washington talks, he said Greek side had been struck and
                            disappointed by rigidity of US position. Greeks had hoped for some
                            substantive response to Papandreou's proposals for a solution and were
                            surprised that President and Washington officials “concentrated only on
                            procedure without touching on substance.” They had feeling of great
                            pressure exerted to force face-to-face talks with Turks, whereas they
                            had cautioned us ahead of time they would not do so under existing
                            circumstances, and they wanted our ideas as to a substantive
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>2. For my part, I explained again great disappointment in Washington over
                            what appeared to us to be most rigid position of PriMin, going over much
                            of ground covered in talks and stressing what to me seemed to be
                            “unconditional surrender” nature of Papandreou's position.</p>
                        <p>3. During talk, Costopoulos acknowledged that there had been no pressure
                            in Washington for Papandreou-<persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            meeting. (This has also been acknowledged by <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> in conversation with Embassy
                            officer.)</p>
                        <p>4. Geneva talks. Although Costopoulos personally believes that
                            Greco-Turkish talks could prove useful, he said that Papandreou still
                            adamant against bilateral talks with the Turks so long as Turkish threat
                            continues. “If either Turkey or the United States will remove that
                            threat, such bilateral talks can be held.”</p>
                        <pb n="182" xml:id="pg_182" facs="0220"/>
                        <p>5. I then questioned Costopoulos about Nicolareizis' instructions, saying
                            I hoped very much that they were broad enough to permit frank
                            discussions with Acheson. He replied that Nicolareizis' instructions
                            included authorization to talk to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, to exchange views with him and to report, but
                            not to engage in “negotiations.” Constopoulos said he would want to keep
                            in closest touch with me as things developed in Geneva. We trust that
                            Dept and <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> will keep us
                            fully informed to permit us to attempt to stimulate appropriate
                            responses from <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>. Costopoulos believes
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> is gaining control of
                            irregular forces on island, and he observed that there had been no
                            marked reaction either from the Turks or British about his presence
                            there. He added that it was important to remember that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> is main hope against Communists
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had had to go
                            along so far.</p>
                        <p>7. FonMin stated that there was no question of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> acting together to establish
                            enosis.</p>
                        <p>8. Greek troops. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            asserted figures about presence Greek troops in Cyprus greatly
                            exaggerated. He admitted that some non-coms had gone to Cyprus in past
                            months in effort gain control of irregulars (this stated to us some time
                            ago by Papandreou). In addition, some 800 Greek soldiers of Cypriot
                            extraction had gone to island—“lets call them deserters.” Only others
                            were about one thousand Greek-Cypriot students who recently returned to
                            island as part of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>'
                            following.</p>
                        <p>9. FonMin expressed irritation over Canadian criticism of Greeks, when
                            Turks have infiltrated many more into Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>10. Suggested approach to solution. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said that in conversation with <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName>, Greeks had taken same line
                            as in Washington. But idea was developed during talks of some sort of
                            “regionalism” on island—“something like Alsace.” <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> was vague as to who
                            suggested this, but gave the impression it came from the Greek side. He
                            was explicit in saying that <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                                Gaulle</persName> supported this idea. I probed to find what exactly
                            was intended by suggestion, but Costopoulos was not clear as to
                            practical workings. His explanation was to effect that an arrangement
                            might be worked out which would ensure Cypriot sovereignty of whole
                            island (subject to later enosis), full protection of minorities and some
                            “Alsatian-type regionalism” which was neither partition nor federalism.
                            Although I am not at all certain as to the implications of this
                            suggestion, it seems to me to be well worth exploration.</p>
                        <p>11. Costopolous repeated that territorial concessions were out of
                            question, “except possibly something like Kastellorizon.”</p>

                        <p>114. From <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. Met with
                            Greek rep <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> for more
                            than an hour this morning. I gave him fairly lengthy exposition of our
                            informal ideas, prefacing my remarks by saying this should not be
                            considered an “American plan” but rather suggests ways we would like to
                            explore with all concerned. I spoke of the three Turkish requisites:
                            national prestige, national security and welfare of Turkish-Cypriots.
                            Also pointed out no solution could be pleasing to both sides and
                            anything agreed upon in end likely to be displeasing to both. If this
                            resulted in criticism directed at me or US Government, we were prepared
                            to accept it.</p>
                        <p>As I had previously done with Turk, I spoke of possibility that sovereign
                            base area on Cyprus, for example Karpas Peninsula, might meet minimum
                            Turkish security requisites. Suggested this area should be large enough
                            to provide sort of safe haven for Turk-Cypriots in times of communal
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <p>I said it seemed to me that neither enosis by itself, nor double enosis
                            nor federalism would necessarily solve problem of securing welfare
                            Turk-Cypriots. Even under Turks own preferred solutions, there would
                            undoubtedly still remain Turkish minorities in Greek-ruled part of
                            island. I was inclined to dismiss double enosis or federalism in any
                            case, I said, because I saw no way to impose these arrangements on
                            hostile Greek-Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I had been thinking of arrangement within framework of some
                            sort of enosis which would give Turk-Cypriots assurance that not only
                            their lives but their property, business, and way of life would be
                            safeguarded. This might be done through a special arrangement, under
                            overall Greek sovereignty, which would take advantage of flexibility
                            inherent in Greek administrative system. Perhaps one or two small areas
                            on island, such as stretch north from Turkish quarter of Nicosia, might
                            be designated as Eparchis and given local self-rule under Turkish Eparch
                            who would, of course, be responsible to higher Greek authority. Another
                            form of local self-rule could be devised for Turks in rest of island,
                            also subject to overall Greek rule.</p>
                        <p>To ensure that Turks would feel confidence in arrangement of this kind, I
                            considered it necessary that there be some international authority,
                            possibly a UN commissioner of sort which had operated in Danzig and Saar
                            between World Wars I and II, empowered to receive and investigate <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0222"/>complaints and make
                            recommendations for corrective action. In turn, there could be right of
                            appeal to International Court of Justice.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> listened intently,
                            took notes and asked number of questions. His only real comment was that
                            he feared his government's public position was pretty far from the sort
                            of thing I had outlined. He pointed out that so far <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> talked publicly only about full
                            independence with right of self-determination, not about enosis. I
                            reminded him of my earlier comment that no solution would be fully
                            agreeable to all parties. However, if Greece and Turkey could come to
                            meeting of minds, we could then deal with the problem of how to get a
                            solution accepted by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and Cypriots generally. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>
                            suggested that at such time <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> should
                            mobilize all its assets (propaganda and other) to create popular demand
                            on island for enosis.</p>
                        <p>During our polite preliminary exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> said that he had had a long talk yesterday
                            with Mediator who had expressed pleasure at my presence here and had
                            asked him to discuss matters with me. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> asked that I get in touch with him whenever
                            I wished. We agreed that each should feel free to talk to the other
                            whenever he had anything to talk about, but I said I probably would want
                            to give him time to report and get reaction from Athens on what I had
                            said. He emphasized and I agreed that these talks should be kept
                            extremely secret.</p>
                        <p>My impression is that <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName>
                            takes his function seriously and will do his best to convey our thoughts
                            and relay those of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to us, but his
                            attitude today certainly bears out previous word that he is not
                            authorized at this point to negotiate. Real test will no doubt come when
                            he gets Athens view on my remarks today. I certainly went rather farther
                            in accepting enosis as good solution than, I believe, any of us has done
                            previously. If anything will induce Papandreou to embark on meaningful
                            dialogue, this should do it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>After reading paper carefully, <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName>
                            opened by saying he still considered that full partition, with space for
                            all Turkish-Cypriots, was only satisfactory answer to problem. Failing
                            that, no safeguards could protect Turk minority against long-term
                            pressures which would be exerted by Greek majority. Once again cited
                            case of Crete and added Western Thrace as examples proving that Greeks
                            always found means to make life unendurable for Turkish minority.</p>
                        <p>He then said paper I had given him, nevertheless, provided “first sign of
                            way out” he had seen. Questioning brought out that he meant that paper
                            accepted principle of Turkish sovereignty on part of Cyprus. Once this
                            was granted, Turks would have firm basis for claiming full area they
                            would need to accommodate all Turk-Cypriots. They could show, as they
                            had explained to me yesterday, that they were entitled to an area of the
                            island proportionate to their percentage of its population and its
                            present land ownership, plus their proportionate share of public lands
                            which were not privately owned either by the Greeks or the Turks. This
                            would approximate areas they had suggested in their partition
                            schemes.</p>
                        <p>I responded that if Turks considered full partition was only possible
                            solution, I would of course be willing to present this to Greek rep, but
                            I had absolutely no hope of its acceptance.</p>
                        <p>There ensued somewhat confused exchange, during which <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> once fell back on his earlier
                            thesis that he would rather see a Greek fait accompli, which Turkey
                            would denounce and refuse to recognize and for which it would exact
                            political and economic revenge, than acquiesce in solution which would
                            not be permanent and would not protect Turkish-Cypriots. <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0224"/>I countered that Turkey would lose
                            tremendously by such an attitude and that consequences would also be
                            extremely rough on Turkish-Cypriots. Sunalp joined in with strong words
                            about how Turks were ready to die for national good, himself included,
                            and implied that it really wouldn't mean too much if a lot more
                            Turkish-Cypriots did get killed.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> made a calming
                            gesture and gave me to understand that perhaps after all there might be
                            room for a little bargaining on the basis I had suggested. Possibly, he
                            said, we could get the Greeks to expand area of Turkish base or, as he
                            preferred to call it, “Turkish area” to point where it would accommodate
                            substantial number of Turkish-Cypriots. Turkey could call this
                            partition, while Greeks might call it something else. At any rate, Erim
                            intimated he would go back to Ankara and see what reaction there would
                            be. We could talk again next week.</p>
                        <p>I said I would do my best with Greeks but could guarantee nothing.</p>
                        <p>We agreed that if anything developed during <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName>'s absence we would communicate with each other
                            through Embassy Ankara and Turkish Mission here. (Turk Perm Rep has been
                            present at all our talks.)</p>
                        <p>Would appreciate any suggestions Department has and especially comments
                            on paper I gave Erim. Unless otherwise instructed, I have in mind giving
                            Greek rep a suitably modified version of it if initial reaction from
                            Athens to our conversation yesterday seems to warrant it.<note n="5" xml:id="d86fn5">In telegram 136 to Geneva, July 15, the Department

                        <p>116. 1. In hour's talk with Prime Minister this Sunday afternoon, he
                            elaborated on urgency with which he viewed need for solution Cyprus <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0225"/>problem. He underlined that he
                            wanted to facilitate Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s work as much as possible and pointed out that,
                            to this end, he had in radio address last night for first time stated
                            that security of Turkish state, as well as protection of Turkish
                            minority, was subject for discussion. Nikolareizis had been called back
                            from Geneva and he was seeing him in evening to give him instructions
                            for his future meetings. He said Nikolareizis could have full and frank
                            discussions with <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d87fn2">The Embassy reported

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Papandreou pointed proudly to new picture of President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> on his bookcase and stated he
                            felt very sorry that he had put on appearance of stubbornness in
                            Washington in countering proposed procedure for getting on with Cyprus
                            problem. He said that he genuinely believed then, as he does now, that
                            until adequate preparations undertaken direct talks would very likely
                            lead to a breakdown and possibility of a clash. He recalled Turkish
                            riots in Istanbul in 1955 as example of what Turks do when talks not
                            going their way. He stressed with great earnestness that he wanted to
                            avoid Greek-Turkish clash at all costs; “war was one hundred times more
                            serious for Greece than for the U.S.,” and it was for this reason that
                            he wanted to get on with substance of problem rather than procedures. He
                            had therefore been disappointed that there had been no conversation as
                            to a solution in Washington and only the stress on sitting down for
                            talks with the Turks. With Turkey's continued threats and rigid
                            position, this was impossible under existing circumstances. However,
                            talks now under way in Geneva were right approach in moving toward
                            solution and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> intent on facilitating
                            them as matter of urgency. The need for urgency was that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was moving closer to Soviets
                            and Nasser and was making moves without consulting <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. He hinted that if too much time
                            elapsed a full independent Cyprus, under strong pressure from the East,
                            might not opt for enosis.</p>
                        <p>3. As to a solution he reiterated that Turkish minority should be
                            provided all guarantees necessary, including <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision—“whatever you want.” For sake of Turkish
                            security and meeting “national prestige” aspect of the problem, he
                            stated Greece would agree to a conversion of British bases to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> bases with Turkish troops and
                            commander. From <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> he had
                            heard that both Wilson in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            certain HMG sources were prepared to consider this solution. He said
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could either retain sovereignty or
                            relinquish it—in either event arrangements could be made for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> take over under a Turkish Commander.
                            This latter point (which could be provided for in agreement between
                            parties), in Papandreou's mind, should meet fully any claim by Turkey on
                            security or prestige grounds. Papandreou did not see any possibility for
                            a Turkish sovereign area on the island. After all, London-Zurich
                            Agreements <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0226"/>had only gotten
                            Turkish troops onto the island; giving them a sovereign area now after
                            nearly 100 years in which Turkey had no claim to sovereignty on the
                            island, would be an unacceptable step for any Greek Government as well
                            as for Cypriots. However, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be
                            prepared to turn over Kastellorizon as a base. (There was also hint that
                            some other concession might be possible, but it was not spelled
                            out.)</p>
                        <p>4. Papandreou touched on Greek troop increase on island, calling them
                            volunteers and “tolerated deserters.” He gave no figures but insisted
                            that they were there to prevent violence, whether from within or
                            without, but most importantly to check and control <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and other Greek-Cypriot
                            military groups.</p>
                        <p>5. When I raised question of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' harassing actions re materials for
                            Turkish-Cypriot refugees, as well as Greek-Cypriot military moves in
                            Temblos and Mansoura area, he stated that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was being called to Athens July 26 and he would
                            impress upon him how counterproductive these actions were in that they
                            goaded the Turks.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_BHD1">Brewster</persName>'s and my over-all
                            impression was that Papandreou very anxious to get on with a prompt
                            solution and that he was eager to see gap between Turk and Greek
                            position closed as soon as possible in Geneva. He fully supported
                            actions of both the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> in their efforts
                            to reach a solution. He stated Greeks and US must at all time talk like
                            “relatives”, because <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>,
                            USSR and especially UAR were now acting like “relatives.” But he
                            cautioned that ultimate solution must be generally acceptable to Cypriot
                            people or else fighting could not be controlled. We consider that
                            Papandreou seriously believes his suggestion set forth in paragraph 3 is
                            as far as he can push Cypriots.</p>

                            morning on their visit in Ankara, <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> discussing political aspects of problem and Sunalp
                            expounding Turkish military point of view (although he wandered over
                            into political elements at times).</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said he had given report to
                            Prime Minister and Cabinet Thursday night. Reaction to this, as to his
                            earlier reports on talks with me, had been one of disappointment. View
                            of Turkish Government, he said, was that Greeks had no intention of
                            making any concessions or negotiating seriously, because they believed
                            that they would gain 100 percent of their objective by standing pat.
                            Their military buildup on island would permit them to do this, defying
                            threat of Turkish intervention, and to hold off until <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> meets this fall, at which time they
                            could either get two-thirds affirmative vote in support of their
                            position for complete independence and self-determination or, if Turks
                            took initiative, defeat any Turkish complaint against them. Meanwhile,
                            there was continuing danger of Greek fait accompli bringing about
                            enosis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said, however, that he had
                            assured government of his belief in my good faith and that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> through me was making sincere effort to
                            find way out. He thought I should be given chance to try. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> accordingly had authorized him to
                            return here and continue talks even though it shared his own pessimistic
                            view of results to be expected. I thanked him for this tribute and
                            assured him that I would not hold him here beyond moment when I became
                            convinced there was no hope of agreement. Thought I might have good
                            indications on this point when I next saw Greek rep after his return
                            from Athens consultations. (<persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> returned today and we have appointment to
                            meet tomorrow at 17:00 local.) If I thought Greeks were clearly
                            unwilling to continue discussions on basis offering some hope of
                            success, I would feel obliged to tell <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> so.</p>
                        <p>I then asked whether they could tell me anything more specific about
                            their consultations in Ankara. At this point Sunalp largely took over
                            conversation. Said that Turk General Staff had been impressed by plan I
                            had outlined in my memorandum (Mission tel)<note n="2" xml:id="d88fn2">See <ref target="#d86">Document 86</ref>.</note> and had given it
                            very careful and sympathetic study. As he put it, they had looked at it
                            “with their white glasses rather than their dark glasses”. He produced
                            map of Cyprus which he said showed some of results of this study. It
                            showed three boundary lines corresponding to three possibilities I had
                            suggested:</p>
                        <p>1. A line crossing Karpas Peninsula about 2/3 of way in from Cape;</p>
                        <p>2. A line from Peristeria village on north coast running across to Boghaz
                            on south coast and in effect enclosing whole peninsula; and </p>
                        <p>3. A line running from just west of Karavas (north coast west of Kyrenia)
                            irregularly southeast through Nicosia and on to Famagusta and
                            paralleling but running north of main Nicosia-Famagusta road.</p>
                        <p> Sunalp called his first line “Greek line” and seemed to dismiss it
                            without consideration. Second line he argued would still be
                            “unsatisfactory <pb n="190" xml:id="pg_190" facs="0228"/>as giving
                            Turkey too little territory and, from military point of view, too little
                            maneuverability. Third line would enclose about 21 percent, 795 square
                            miles of island area and would be acceptable from military point of view
                            as well as providing minimum space for Turkish-Cypriots. This last
                            boundary would give Turkey port of Kyrenia and also access to deep water
                            port of Famagusta although this need not necessarily be Turkish port.
                            They would be satisfied if it were <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            base, which Turkey could use in time of war.</p>
                        <p> Sunalp admitted that there were no great obstacles to construction of
                            artificial port on Karpas Peninsula, provided we put up the money, and
                            indicated a site around Boghaz as logical location. He also admitted
                            construction of air strip was feasible but indicated as preferred site
                            something in the neighborhood of village of Trikomo, which is outside
                            second line. He continued to insist, however, on military necessity of
                            having greater space for defensive maneuvering and argued that minimum
                            Turkish military need would be for line taking in pass from north coast
                            through Kyrenia range down to Lefkoniko as well as high part of ridge
                            lying to west of that as far as Pentadaktylos Peak. This, he said, would
                            give Turks flanking position against any enemy which might approach
                            sovereign area across plain from southwest. Without it, Turk forces
                            would be penned in narrow peninsula with no way of countering
                            attack.</p>
                        <p> Sunalp and Erim were both somewhat vague in their justification for
                            third line, and in course of conversation it became clear that they did
                            not contend this was military necessity but rather was modification of
                            double enosis proposal, based primarily on political considerations.
                            Sunalp especially emphasized importance of holding Kyrenia as means of
                            quick access to Turk-Cypriots in Nicosia in case of trouble. I got
                            impression they probably would settle for boundary line which included
                            pass north of Lefkoniko but stopped just west of it.</p>
                        <p>In course of conversation I raised question whether defense against major
                            military attack from land was really important, suggesting that Turks
                            themselves might well be able to forestall any such thing and in any
                            case it seemed unlikely to occur. I got no satisfactory answer. I also
                            indicated gently that I thought it would be very difficult to get Greek
                            consideration of sort of thing they were proposing. At the end, however,
                            I said I would not try at this time to discuss their presentation; first
                            of all, I wanted to think about it and secondly I thought it would be a
                            waste of time for them and for me to argue unless and until we found out
                            that Greeks were willing to talk on basis I had suggested. I would be in
                            touch with them again just as soon as I had anything new.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">In telegram 166 from Geneva, July 20, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> further reported that

                        <p>181. From: <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. One-hour
                            discussion late this afternoon with Greek rep <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> may be summarized as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. He said he had been called back to Athens last Saturday and had gone
                            expecting very negative reaction to suggestions I had put to him. He had
                            long conversations with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister alone. Was
                            pleased to find that they were determined to be forthcoming and
                            conciliatory as possible. Papandreou had insisted on his great desire
                            for peace and expressed appreciation of efforts I was making to avoid
                            Greek-Turkish conflict. He had given him (<persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName>) reply to ideas I had thrown out, which
                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> thought really should be
                            considered as tentative proposal rather than separate suggestions.</p>
                        <p>2. My proposal consisted of three parts: (a) minority rights for Turkish
                            population of Cyprus; (b) international supervision of application of
                            these rights; and (c) provision for Turkish national security. To these
                            three points <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>'s reactions were:</p>
                        <p>(1) Although it would be difficult for Greece, with its excellent record
                            of treatment of all its citizens, to give special privileges to minority
                            on Cyprus, he nevertheless would be willing to grant substantially what
                            I had suggested, even including two Turk-Cypriot administered Eparchis
                            under Turk-Cypriot Eparchs, provided these latter were appointed from
                            Athens and not by Ankara. He would also accept establishment special
                            Turk-Cypriot courts.</p>
                        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0230"/>
                        <p>(2) It would likewise be very hard to accept international supervision of
                            this arrangement, but Papandreou was nevertheless willing to agree to
                            type of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence I had outlined.</p>
                        <p>(3) Even though cession of Greek territory to foreign country would be
                            extremely difficult to sell to Greek people, <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> was prepared let Turkey have island of Kastellorizon as
                            military base to protect its approaches. Question of sovereign Turkish
                            base area on Cyprus, however, was another matter. Most he could
                            contemplate in way of Turkish military presence on Cyprus would be a
                            sharing of British base areas with Turkish forces, provided bases
                            themselves remained entirely under British sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>3. I said that <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> had indeed made genuine
                            effort to bridge gap between Greece and Turkey and I was grateful for
                            it. I thought this gave us real basis for continued discussion. In
                            particular, I would now try to develop and give to parties in more
                            concrete form ideas regarding character of minority regime and minority
                            rights which I thought might be applied and which I had not tried to
                            make precise in previous talks.</p>
                        <p>4. I said, however, that I should be less than frank if I did not express
                            fears that Greek response on sovereign base question would fail to meet
                            minimum Turkish demands.</p>
                        <p>Turks, in their conversations with me, had been arguing for a good deal
                            more than I had proposed, whereas Greeks were not even accepting idea of
                            Turkish sovereign area, regardless of how small. With regard to
                            Papandreou suggestion that Turks might share British bases, I said I
                            could not say definitely what Turkish reaction would be, since I had
                            never put this idea to them. I doubted they would accept it, however. In
                            any case, it was not useful for us to debate matter today since we did
                            not even know whether British would be amenable. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> commented that Papandreou
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> were now in
                            London and he thought they would put the suggestion to British.<note n="2" xml:id="d89fn2"> Papandreou visited London July 20–21. The
                                Embassy reported on his talks at the Foreign Office in telegram 362
                                from London, July 22. (Ibid.)</note> We agreed that we would await
                            some report on London meetings before trying to go further along this

                        <p>5. There followed considerable discussion of the Turkish sovereign base
                            question. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> was quite
                            firm in expressing opinion that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            could not accept it and that in any case Greek-Cypriots would never do
                            so. He asserted it would be regarded both in Cyprus and in Greece as
                            form of partition. Furthermore, it would “give Turks more than they had
                            before” and would establish them in position to interfere in affairs of
                            Cyprus in future. This would be perennial cause of trouble. I took issue
                            with some of his argumentation, especially thesis that it would give
                            Turkey more than she had before, but I shall not bother Department<pb n="193" xml:id="pg_193" facs="0231"/> with details. I admitted that
                            question of sovereign base area might become breaking point which would
                            make my efforts here useless, since I believed Turks felt just as
                            strongly on their side as <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> said Greeks did on theirs. Nevertheless, I
                            thought we could usefully continue our efforts and explore all aspects
                            at least for a while longer.</p>
                        <p>I said I thought I should be as candid with Turks as I had been with
                            Greeks and would therefore tell <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> and Sunalp substantially what <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> had conveyed to me. He
                            agreed. Am seeing Turks again late tomorrow morning.<note n="3" xml:id="d89fn3">

                        <p>After reflecting on the Prime Minister's message, I wish to repeat to you
                            my deep appreciation of his constructive effort toward a fair
                            settlement. I do not detract an iota of appreciation or admiration, in
                            asking again for his understanding help. Though the gap has been
                            narrowed, there still remains a gap. If both sides can find a way to
                            help, it may be bridged. No one will understand the situation better
                            than Your Excellency if I put it in Robert Browning's words:</p>
                        <p>“O, the little more, and how much it is!</p>
                        <p>The little less and what worlds away!”</p>
                        <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0232"/>
                        <p>The gap which from the Turkish point of view the Prime Minister's
                            reaction to my suggestions leaves unbridged lies in the
                            politico-military area. The protection of minorities seems in a fair way
                            to being solved. If we look for a moment at the change in the Turkish
                            position provided in the agreements of 1959–1960 to that contemplated by
                            the Prime Minister's views on my suggestions, we can see what seems to
                            them a serious deterioration in it.</p>
                        <p>May I summarize the Turkish views as follows:</p>
                        <p>When the Ottoman Empire ceded Cyprus to the British in 1878, it was ceded
                            to a great naval power for the most part friendly to Turkey, except when
                            in the two world wars Turkey made the same mistake as the Germans in
                            miscalculating American intervention to change the relative military
                            power of the embattled forces. So far as life on the island was
                            concerned, the two ethnic groups lived peacefully together under British
                            rule until the mid-1950s.</p>
                        <p>Under the settlement of 1959–1960, the island passed from the control of
                            a world power to qualified independence under the guarantees and
                            quasi-guardianship of three powers. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots, to
                            protect their relative interest, gained the following rights guaranteed
                            by treaties:</p>
                        <p>1. A position in legislative and executive branches of the government for
                            the Turkish Cypriots giving them veto power, the same right on questions
                            of judicial interpretation of the constitution and separate courts for
                            intra-Turkish Cypriot disputes.</p>
                        <p>2. A treaty right to maintain troops on the island.</p>
                        <p>3. A treaty right to reinforce those troops by intervention, after
                            complying with specified procedures, and to use the troops if necessary
                            to preserve the constitution, independence and territorial integrity of
                            the island, as provided in the Treaty of Guarantee.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> maintains—and
                            I am not here disputing the fact—that some of these provisions are
                            “unworkable”, and he is changing them unilaterally. Our present search
                            is for a way to change them by agreement. Such a change by its very
                            nature contemplates a diminution of the Turkish position from the
                            present so-called “unworkable” one. The task is to gain mutual agreement
                            to alteration by recognizing the essential elements of the various
                            positions.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">First: Turkish Position in the Government</p>
                        <p>The Greek and Cypriot views contemplate abolition of the veto power in
                            the Government of the island as a whole. The Prime Minister has
                            indicated a willingness to substitute for this a considerable degree of
                            local self-government along the lines which I suggested and further
                            spell out in an accompanying memorandum.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> But while this is a happy contribution <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0233"/>to protection of minorities under a
                            constitutional system akin to that of Greece, it would not offer
                            security against a change in the regime which would produce a communist
                            government on the island. While we hope this is unlikely, it cannot be
                            called absurd. This question requires further consideration.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Second: The Legal Position of Turkish Troops on
                            Cyprus</p>
                        <p>This right is now established by the Treaty of Alliance. The troops are
                            to form part of a tripartite headquarters on Cypriot territory to defend
                            the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. The Prime
                            Minister's proposal is to abolish this treaty right and—presumably by a
                            new treaty, either a bilateral one with Britain, or a quadripartite one
                            with Greece and Cyprus added—to have facilities provided by the British
                            on one or both of their sovereign bases.</p>
                        <p>One sees at once—or if one does not, the Turkish representatives are
                            quick to point it out—that by this exchange the Turks lose a right of
                            military presence on the island which runs directly to them, and become
                            instead tenants of the British. They point out that the British bases
                            are already under attack in the Cyprus House of Representatives. Should
                            the British come to believe that a change in their Middle Eastern
                            commitments or other considerations might render the bases on Cyprus
                            less necessary or desirable, the Turkish position as their tenants might
                            be tenuous indeed. They also stress the difficulty of joint use of such
                            small bases, even should the British be willing to consider it, and the
                            complexity of the use of the rights ancillary to the bases provided the
                            British under the Annex to the Declaration of the Government of the
                            United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, I respectfully urge the Prime Minister to reconsider
                            his position on a Turkish military presence on the island running
                            directly to them. If the conception of a cession of sovereignty presents
                            grave difficulty, is there another conception which might be more
                            acceptable, such as a lease of an area, or the grant of administrative
                            control, or something of the sort?</p>
                        <p>The Turks now have a right for their troops to be in Cyprus—and they are
                            stationed in the heart of the island. The right to be in Cyprus, of
                            course, carries with it a right to a location. The mere force of gravity
                            requires it. Surely our imaginations are equal to adapting to a changed
                            situation a new, stable and secure situs for the exercise of this
                            military presence.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Third: The Interest, Right and Duty of Turkey to
                            Share in Protecting and Maintaining a New Settlement</p>
                        <p>If the settlement provides for the continued independence of Cyprus,
                            while keeping open the opportunity for the people of Cyprus to choose
                            enosis, an agreed change in the present treaties would doubtless <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0234"/>contain treaty assurances from
                            Cyprus that in the meantime it would not enter into engagements with a
                            foreign power permitting the use of its territory in a manner hostile to
                            the interests of Britain, Greece or Turkey. Turkey, as well as Greece
                            and Britain, would have a great interest in maintaining the new
                            settlement. The granting of military or other facilities to unfriendly
                            foreign powers would be contrary to the interests of the three powers
                            mentioned above and would be inconsistent with a new settlement.
                            Doubtless enosis would be a safeguard against this danger. But enosis is
                            not a foregone conclusion and Turkey cannot be expected to rely on this
                            alone. A Turkish legal military presence on the island would still be
                            necessary for Turkish security.</p>
                        <p>These considerations underline the importance of what has been said about
                            a proper, stable and secure location for this military presence.</p>

                        <p>223. From <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. We had
                            go-around yesterday with Turks with Gen. Oberbeck from HQ US <gloss target="#t_CINCEUR1">CINCEUR</gloss> and Col. Gussie from Nicosia
                            participating. I began by telling <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> I had made new approach to Greek rep to urge that
                            Papandreou make greater effort to meet Turkish security need.<note n="2" xml:id="d91fn2">See <ref target="#d89">Document 89</ref>.</note> He
                            thanked me. I mentioned that I still had no word as to whether British
                            would be willing to share their base on Cyprus, as suggested by Greeks.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> commented that this idea
                            of using British bases not even within scope terms of reference given
                            him and Sunalp by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>; he was not
                            prepared discuss it and hoped it would not be considered seriously. I
                            said I had made clear to Nikolareisis my belief that bases would not do
                            from Turkish point of view. I added that my military advisers (Oberbeck
                            and Gussie) had agreed with Sunalp's arguments that sharing base would
                            be very difficult and unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>At my suggestion, we then reviewed at considerable length and with
                            considerable argumentation what Turkey's minimum needs might <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0235"/>be. Taking idea of base on Karpas
                            Peninsula as basis for discussion, Sunalp explained that Turkey
                            considered it had to have on Cyprus facilities and space for one
                            division, 14,000 men, plus a port, an airfield and one squadron of
                            aircraft. For this, he said, <gloss target="#t_TGS1">TGS</gloss>
                            considered even whole peninsula would be inadequate, primarily because
                            of its narrowness and lack of [garble—space for dispersal?] and also
                            because it would be bottleneck from which deployment would be difficult.
                            It also lacked major terrain feature for defense.</p>
                        <p> Oberbeck and Gussie vigorously and ably took issue with this thesis,
                            pointing out that area of more than 200 sq. miles comprised within
                            peninsula was considerably more than we considered necessary for all
                            peacetime purposes for one of our own larger divisions. Gussie stressed
                            that in fact there was good road network on Cyprus and deployment from
                            base of peninsula should be easy. On score of defensibility, our side
                            made point that if major attack threatened Turks would clearly not sit
                            on base awaiting it but rather would move out into other parts of island
                            before attack took place. Apart from this Gussie pointed out that
                            relatively small number of men should be able to hold peninsula until
                            reinforcements arrived.</p>
                        <p> Sunalp countered with various arguments, including: (1) political
                            situation might not permit Turkish deployment in advance of attack
                            (e.g., allies had repeatedly prevented Turkey from moving against Cyprus
                            during present crisis); (2) outlets for peninsula were not in fact
                            satisfactory despite Gussie's assertion; and (3) because of location
                            Cyprus, Turkish establishment there could not be regarded as being on
                            normal peacetime basis; in Turkey, Turk Army units were always kept
                            dispersed over a wide area because of imminent possibility of attack.
                            Therefore, greater area was needed than would be required for American
                            division in U.S.</p>
                        <p>At one time Oberbeck made point that if Turk military on Cyprus were
                            threatened with major attack it was inconceivable that Turkey would be
                            alone. To this Sunalp responded emotionally that Turkey's allies had
                            done it no good since last December.</p>
                        <p>Debate went on for some time. Finally Sunalp asked Oberbeck to give his
                            honest opinion from point of view of member Turkish General Staff as to
                            whether with one division on Karpas Peninsula he could fulfill three
                            missions I had suggested in my earlier memorandum:<note n="3" xml:id="d91fn3">See <ref target="#d86">Documents 86</ref> and <ref target="#d88">88</ref>.</note> (1) to deny island to an enemy as
                            base of operations against Turkey; (2) to keep open approaches to ports
                            of Mersin and Iskenderun; and (3) to provide guarantee against future
                            mistreatment of Turk-Cypriots. Oberbeck replied flatly that he certainly
                            could fulfill these three missions under circumstances <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0236"/>specified, and gave reasons. Sunalp's
                            smiling rejoinder was that if Oberbeck were Turkish officer “he would be
                            retired tomorrow”. Col. Gussie intervened along same lines and also got
                            himself “retired”.</p>
                        <p>A couple of times I tried to get Turks to recognize that any arrangement
                            would have to be compromise between what was ideal from military point
                            of view and what was practical. I think <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> was probably fully conscious of this although he
                            did not explicitly say so but Sunalp was stubborn to the last.</p>
                        <p>It is too soon to say what effect of all this may be; I think it was very
                            useful exercise and probably impressed even Sunalp. Oberbeck, Gussie,
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> and I will meet
                            again with Turks at lunch tomorrow.<note n="4" xml:id="d91fn4">In

                            Turks military presence after enosis would be only to defend their own
                            mainland and to help Greeks defend Cyprus against foreign attack. Before
                            enosis Turkey would have additional right to prevent a change of regime
                            that would <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0237"/>bring about a
                            Communist state on Cyprus. We are counting on <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> and our memo to make this
                            clear in Athens.</p>
                        <p>Turning to “(a)”-(Sunalp), he undoubtedly wants to use base for
                            protection of Turkish minority, which is not conferred in haec verba by
                            present treaties. His method of discussion is to confuse all desirable
                            uses of base, jumping from one to another to avoid being cornered. With
                            the able help of our General and Colonel we have pretty well got him
                            pinned inside the Karpas Peninsula as a base for military purpose of
                            housing and training a military force to protect Turkey and Cyprus from
                            foreign foe. From there we will go on to limit his other desired
                            purposes both before and after enosis; but always aware that whatever is
                            said on paper, Turkish military presence will be a deterrent against
                            abuse of the minority and will be used as a corrective if large-scale
                            abuse should occur. Sunalp does not suffer from incapacity to understand
                            our position but from unwillingness to accept it. We shall watch out,
                            however, that we do not give him ground for a plausible claim that he
                            misunderstands.</p>

                        <p>3. We are using the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> structure in an
                            effort to gain some hold on the military buildup on the Island of both
                            Greek and Turkish forces.</p>
                        <p>4. We are making a serious effort to build up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Cyprus and prompt the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> officers there to act with firmness in holding down
                            fighting.</p>
                        <p>5. Every effort is being made to play down the Geneva talks. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> is working quietly and
                            without press attention. The talks are being carried on under the cover
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator who is cooperating in
                            this tactic. We have a moderately hopeful attitude toward the

                            of our current optimism. It was agreed that no optimistic noises should

                            with Papandreou who apparently considers this would be impracticable as
                            well as inconsistent with excellent Greek record with regard to existing
                            Turkish ethnic groups in Greece.</p>

                            are being asked of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> without any
                            indication such concessions likely produce agreement with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. Nikolareizis will be instructed obtain clearer idea of
                            what Turks actually prepared accept.</p>
                        <p>One of the most serious problems confronting <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is fact <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would oppose any agreement between Greek and
                            Turkish Govts providing for special civil organization for Turkish
                            minority as well as Turk military base by asserting that such types of
                            provisions would constitute only revision of London-Zurich Accords
                            incompatible with completely independent Cyprus. Basically <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is opposed to enosis, but
                            will not publicly admit it. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> did not assess possibility <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> himself might be prepared
                            make concessions to Turks on his own initiative in effort preempt <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            agreement, if by so doing he could preserve independent status of
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, speaking very
                            personally and confidentially, said he did not see how under these
                            circumstances it was going to be possible to reach an agreement with
                            Turks which would also be satisfactory to Govt of Cyprus. If agreement
                            on basic issues could be reached by Turks and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, perhaps best tactical procedure would be as follows:
                            simultaneous declaration by Greek and Cypriot Parliaments proclaiming
                            enosis followed by plebiscite in Cyprus and possibly Greece ratifying
                            this decision. After proclamation of enosis, Greek Govt would then be in
                            position to honor agreements reached with Turks and US Govt as result of
                            current negotiations. In <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>' view such agreement would provide measures
                            for guarantee of protection for Turkish ethnics as well as leased<pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0240"/> Turk military base (sovereign
                            base unacceptable) for period perhaps as long as 25 years. Base would be
                            purely military, probably on Karpas Pe-ninsula, limited in size, and
                            without space required either for large number of Turkish troops or safe
                            haven area for Turk ethnic civilians. If meeting of minds could be
                            reached with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> along foregoing lines
                            perhaps prompt solution could be found before convening of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and under circumstances which would
                            avoid giving <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> apparently
                            valid justification publicly oppose enosis.</p>

                            Papandreou has insisted on essentiality absolute secrecy regarding
                            talks. We understood his desire that information be held close so that
                            various ideas could be discussed without governments having to take firm
                            positions on one or another. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> assured Ambassador Matsas Mr. Acheson <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0241"/>has worked very closely with Mediator,
                            has not pushed himself forward and that we have been fortunate so far in

                            completely in dark.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said we had two problems:
                            (1) how to answer press questions; and (2) what do we say to Turks. As
                            Papandreou aware, talks have proceeded with candor and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> has reported back and forth
                            to each representative. Fact that some of points mentioned in Reuters
                            story have been reported to Turks and others not might arouse suspicions
                            of Turks we are not playing fairly with them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> asked if there were a
                            coherent plan. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said a
                            variety of ideas had been discussed but there was not a “plan”.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> speculated that only
                            first point “Union with Greece” would appeal to Greeks and other points,
                            cession Kastellorizon, base, financial compensation, etc., would be
                            detestable. Therefore he could not see it in <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> interest to leak this information. He surmised that
                            since all of points at one time or another had been mentioned in press,
                            Modiano had possibly read as “confirmation” a “no comment” reply by
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> official.</p>
                        <p>He proposed telephoning <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> Papandreou for
                            clarification and instructions. After talking to Papandreou Matsas
                            reported that Prime Minister was very annoyed by the leak, indicating
                            Greeks had endeavored to brief Cypriots on status of talks and Cypriots
                            had talked too much. Prime Minister proposed to deny flatly that there
                            was any such thing as “<persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> Plan”.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> reported
                            second telephone call with Papandreou, after latter had investigated
                            Reuters story on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' press
                            conference. <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> repeated his extreme

                            this had happened since he realized efforts at Geneva are being directed

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> intends use military
                            force obtain political solution. He intends increase pressures on Turks
                            and then attack Turk strongholds. He will act within forty-five days.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will by-pass <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediation and introduce resolution <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> obtain recognition de facto

                            dependent upon Nasser. GOC has received UAR material and obtained

                            Claims Papandreou “50 percent” in agreement. Added GOC endeavoring

                            but has not seen any missiles. He assumed they were shipped from Greece
                            and were US origin. (This may reflect rumors we have heard other
                            sources.)</p>
                        <p>In order prevent escalation problem, <persName corresp="#p_FN1">Farmakis</persName> intends recommend his colleagues that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> be deposed.

If <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> able submit resolution <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Greece will face dilemma. In this
                            event Papandreou cannot resist clamor support <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Result will be further
                            weakening Greek ties with West. He claimed Greece drifting toward
                            neutralism and shifting its focus away from Communist threat. On July
                            27, for example, he informed Papandreou transferred 150 key army
                            officers to provinces; and he afraid <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            will transfer Greek army officers sympathetic ouster <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from Cyprus unless action
                            quickly initiated.</p>
                        <p>With regard Papandreou's position, <persName corresp="#p_FN1">Farmakis</persName> acknowledged Premier cannot be challenged at
                            polls; and he does not wish participate any plan aimed removal
                            Papandreou. Opposition group believes Papandreou will sanction <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> removal if faced with threat
                            of force by military elements. <persName corresp="#p_FN1">Farmakis</persName> indicated they would not, however, let
                            Papandreou stand their way. Otherwise if situation continues civil war
                            will occur Greece within year. Once <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> removed enosis would be proclaimed. <persName corresp="#p_FN1">Farmakis</persName> said Turks would be given small
                            part island to administer and he seemed unconcerned re Turk

                            support. He emphasized Greece and United States had same interest in
                            problem. Personally he would rather be “dead than red.” Therefore, he
                            favored action now. Added United States would be kept apprised, because

                        <p>190. 1. I called on PriMin today at Kastri with <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHD1">Brewster</persName> present. We talked for about ninety minutes.
                            PriMin received us in his bedroom (he has been in bed for several days
                            with kidney trouble which apparently developed while on London trip). He
                            immediately apologized profusely for unfortunate impression leak of
                                “<persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposals” was
                            bound to create. He attributed this leak entirely to Cypriots who had
                            been here this week, with whom naturally he had had to discuss certain
                            aspects of Geneva talks and to whom he had shown some papers but not all
                            (he did not distinguish). He said he had just completed a call to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in which he had
                            expressed his deep indignation at this leak and at <hi rend="italic">Makarios</hi>' most unfortunate press conference. He said he had
                            come to conclusion this week that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was “impossible to deal with” since he was
                            completely intransigent on all points. He had “used” Greek press and all
                            of this at expense of Greek Government which wants to maintain good
                            relations with US. He had done the unforgivable by putting Greek
                            Government in a position of looking soft and willing to bargain, whereas
                            he (<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>) was the hero
                            standing up against the forces of the West. PriMin was convinced that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was playing a
                            completely “Nasser game” and wanted to set up an independent Cyprus “as
                            an Arab state.”</p>
                        <p>2. He then stated that, after this meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he had concluded there was
                            only one solution, “a dangerously simple one”—enosis must come promptly
                            because there could be no interim period in which Cypriots had
                            unfettered independence. It was important to follow this course in order
                            to get rid of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Although
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is working against
                            enosis, Papandreou believed if action is taken at early date it can be
                            achieved. His proposal was that enosis be achieved by joint action of
                            the Greek Cypriot and Greek Parliaments, while agreements could be
                            reached within the “family group” (i.e., US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Turkey, Greece) to provide for a bill of rights for the
                            Turk minority and a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base with
                            Turkish Commander granted by Greece to Turkey. He mentioned frequently
                            that he, as PriMin, could not force concessions out of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> who thought he would win an
                            independent Cyprus. Only way to be rid of this was to have Cyprus a part
                            of Greece. Enosis with a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            should offer Turks security both for their minorities and strategically.
                            A Cuba-type Cyprus under <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' aegis would certainly be dangerous for <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0245"/>Turkey and for us all. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would also be prepared to indemnify any
                            Turk Cypriots who might wish to leave Cyprus, and hopefully there could
                            be some economic aid provided Turkey which would help meet its problems.
                            He said foregoing was in essence what he would put to Nikolareizis who
                            was arriving this evening for consultations, and which would in turn be
                            passed on to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. Speaking personally, I stressed that I could not imagine Turks would
                            accept such a proposal, even assuming that we all want to get rid of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. The proposal did
                            not take realistically into consideration the three basic factors which
                            Turkish side considers essential to a solution. It was, in fact, asking
                            Turks for complete and unconditional capitulation. After outlining some
                            of events related to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            visit, including his Nicosia departure statement that there could be no
                            “agreed solution”, the “complete identity of views” communiqué, and
                            ending with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' homecoming
                            statement that Cyprus would have full support of Greek armed forces if
                                attacked,<note n="2" xml:id="d97fn2">Text of the <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>-Papandreou communiqué,

                                31, the Embassy commented on both <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' “self-assured” press conference and the

                                statements upon his return. (Ibid.)</note> I said that, although I
                            accepted his assurances re the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> story leak and his indignation at <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' press conference, [no?]
                            Turks and few others would believe this was not Greek-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> maneuver. He denied this
                            heatedly, and twice said that he now considered <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> “an enemy.”</p>
                        <p>4. I then pressed him on question of proposed appeal to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on which he had apparently agreed a
                            common line with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He
                            replied that he agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on only three things: a) need to maintain peace
                            on island (and here he said <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had promised him to take no military action of
                            any importance without prior consultation); b) Greece would defend
                            Cyprus if attacked; and c) Greece will support Cyprus in appeal to the
                            General Assembly if no solution found. Papandreou repeated his urgent
                            desire to reach solution before General Assembly meets, otherwise
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> might gain his
                            complete independence. If circumstances make appeal to Assembly
                            necessary, Papandreou envisages that Cypriots would take initiative in
                            trying to get resolution endorsing independence for Cyprus and right of
                            its people to determine their own future. To this I responded that I
                            knew of no authority whereby the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could
                            effectively take step which would nullify treaties entered into in good
                            faith. I also pointed to questionable company he would be keeping and
                            fact that, in interim, anything might happen and agreed that his
                            proposal was “dangerously” simple. He acknowledged this, but said <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0246"/>he saw no other course in view
                            of intransigence of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            strong public appeal of self-determination in Greece as well as
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>5. Conversation ended in friendly atmosphere, with Papandreou agreeing
                            that next step was for him to give his instructions to Nikolareizis, who
                            would continue talks in Geneva.<note n="3" xml:id="d97fn3">In telegram

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Events of last few days lead us to
                            believe that Papandreou is, in fact, fed to the teeth with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that he cannot draw any
                            concessions from latter. Of course, this could all be Byzantine plot,
                            but we are satisfied that only point Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> have in common now is
                            dedication to self-determination.</p>
                        <p>Many Greeks, including several officials, outspoken in their distaste for
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and his
                            unreliability. However, the very strong and profound conviction among
                            all Greeks that Cypriots should have right of self-determination is
                            making them prisoner to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' machinations and allows him, in name of what they
                            all believe to be only just end, to call turn for Greeks. The “capital
                            of Hellenism” is in Nicosia on this issue.</p>
                        <p>When I was pointing out to Papandreou the ways in which Greece was being
                            “used”, including giving military support to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, Papandreou replied that he
                            recognized this, but asked what would happen if Greece withdrew its
                            support? He answered his own question by saying things would be even
                            worse and there would be no control over possible military adventures;
                            moreover, it would surely result in “others, particularly the UAR”
                            giving more support “which has been promised.”</p>
                        <p>Our reading of situation is that Papandreou sincerely wants to achieve
                            enosis before matters go to the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
                            for he has come to believe it is only way to set aside <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that latter is real
                            stumbling block in all Western efforts to resolve Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>We realize Papandreou's present line is not compatible with Turkey's
                            wishes, but if he cannot in fact deliver <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, it may well be only alternative which has a
                            chance of being in Turkey's as well as our own interests. It may be
                            possible in Geneva talks to pin Greeks down to specific understandings
                            to meet some of Turk desires after enosis. However, in my opinion, we
                            cannot expect agreement on sovereign base for Turks nor on full scale of
                            special position for Turk-Cypriot minority envisaged in <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> memo to Nikolareizis.
                            Greeks consider this would lead to same type problems as exist under
                            London-Zurich Accords.</p>

                            gives general account my conversation with Erkin yesterday re Cyprus.
                            Following are points with specific reference Geneva conversations which
                            require <gloss target="#t_TAG1">TAG</gloss> transmission.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said that in his opinion
                            cession of Karpas Peninsula was not enough. Would be impossible sell to
                            Turkish people. Regarding territorial compensation elsewhere, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> uninterested in acquiring territory in
                            Western Europe, which apparently British idea. Re Kastellorizon, it so
                            small that impossible consider as serious concession. These comments
                            were made somewhat incidentally with <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> making no attempt at outlining formula which could
                            accept.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said he felt situation
                            had developed to point where US and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            should agree on solution, following which <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> would endeavor convince
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to convince GOC. I observed this not my understanding
                            of modus operandi of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            who I thought had made clear that his first effort would be directed to
                            attempting narrow area of difference between Turk and Greek viewpoints,
                            following which consideration could be given to bridging gap by specific
                            recommendations of our own. However, I assumed that whether this done
                            would depend on degree of disparity of Turk and Greek views as
                            established by current Geneva exchanges. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> did not pursue further.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said he had heard from
                                <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> hoped get somewhere by end
                            of next week. He hoped so because passage of time inimical to
                            Turkey.</p>
                        <p>4. Referring to Athens leak as “despicable” and references of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> as unpardonable, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said this not first time however
                            that there had been leak and referred to an unspecified article in <hi rend="italic">London Times</hi> which he felt had been made privy to
                            info furnished by British representative in Geneva. He observed this

                        <p>5. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> wanted know what
                            we would be prepared do if Geneva talks broke down and to what extent

                            replied would be difficult give specific answer to this question for
                            simple reason that it based on hypothetical situation in which talks
                            might end. Would depend on degree of progress made, analysis of
                            resulting situation, etc., which are presently unknown. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> did not dispute this but did say
                            he foresaw time approaching for some major decisions and he would ask us

                        <p>Following are our immediate comments, possibly to be followed by others
                            later:</p>
                        <p>We would prefer to see next move in steps, rather than one big, desperate
                            leap. Turks have been remarkably patient, but this can't last for length
                            of time needed to work out whole scheme you outline unless in meantime
                            they see something moving at least slightly in their direction. They
                            have given quite a lot already, the Greeks hardly anything at all. I
                            much doubt Turks would be responsive even to Ray Hare's eloquence so
                            long as they have clear impression Greeks simply standing fast on
                            extreme position.</p>
                        <p>I therefore hope <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> can
                            induce Papandreou to send <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> back before mid-week with forthcoming
                                proposals,<note n="4" xml:id="d99fn4">In telegram 197 from Athens,
                                August 2, the Embassy reported that <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> had told <persName corresp="#p_AN1">Anschuetz</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> would “probably” return to Geneva on
                                Tuesday, August 9. (Ibid.) According to <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName>, Papandreou accepted rest of my
                                proposals and threw in Kastellorion to boot. It is important that
                                    <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> be empowered
                                confirm this on his return. (Recent reports from Athens have cast
                                serious doubt on sincerity of Papandreou's offer.)</note> including
                            long-term lease arrangement for at least part of Karpas Peninsula.
                            Believe Turks would compromise for about time mentioned your telegram,
                            and they might even accept shorter time period. These are things that
                            could be bargained out, through me, or directly, if Greeks would once
                            accept principle of Turkish base.</p>
                        <p>If we can get these points accepted Athens, we can go to work full blast
                            to work out agreement on substance of settlement.</p>
                        <p>As to method of putting agreement into effect, seems to me line to be
                            explored is that of formulating some fairly vague announcement of
                            agreement in principle which would say that understandings reached
                            provide for safeguarding Turkish national security and welfare of
                            Turkish Cypriots together with right of Cypriot self-determination and
                            that both governments are satisfied on this. Then plebiscite or other
                            action on enosis could be precipitated.</p>
                        <p>Realize this will call forth <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> opposition and require very strong Greek
                            propaganda effort together with use all available methods control His
                            Beatitude, but if we don't approach enosis with at least this much
                            assurance to Turks we risk overthrow of Inonu government and even
                            Republican regime in Turkey. Fact is, procedural dilemma we face simply
                            will not go away.</p>
                        <p>We are hesitant about proposed use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> because:</p>
                        <p>1. It would seem impossible to keep it secret, considering atmosphere and
                            attitudes in Greece and number of governments who would know about
                            it.</p>
                        <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0250"/>
                        <p>2. If, or rather when, it becomes public knowledge, it will produce an
                            array of Afro-Asian and SovBloc states, and probably also <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant, in support of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>3. We doubt that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has any more or as
                            much influence as US on Greeks, and we have already failed in massive
                            frontal attack on Papandreou. As personal comment I would add that I
                            couldn't predict where effort guided by Mike Pearson would end.</p>
                        <p>4. Finally, public <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> pressure on
                            Greece if successful would have effect of change in Greek policy and
                            position from one founded on Greek national interests to one adopted
                            under duress applied by Anglo-Saxons. Could any democratic government
                            stand this?</p>
                        <p>In short, I think we had better continue to try to play this big trout
                            rather than risk everything by hauling on the line.<note n="5" xml:id="d99fn5">In telegram 176 to Athens, July 30, <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that he “accepted”

                        <p> Nikolareizis explained that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposals re Turk minority which Nikolareizis
                            conveyed to Papandreou and Papandreou approved in principle, had been
                            made purposely unspecific by <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> in my effort stimulate examination of problem.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> memorandum this
                            subject which was transmitted subsequently outlined much more
                            comprehensive arrangement involving provisions which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could not accept for reasons which
                            Embassy has previously reported. Greeks “accept principles outlined in
                            general conversation but not proposed treatment in depth mentioned in
                            memo.”</p>
                        <p>Referring to Lausanne Treaty provisions for Tendos and Imbros, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> pointed out that (aside
                            from fact Turks had not carried out provisions) situations were not
                            parallel. Argument was that purpose Article 14 was to ensure that people
                            on island, who mostly Greeks, should have local self-determination.
                            Applying this to Cyprus, he contended that, even with current abnormal
                            concentrations of Turkish population in certain sections of island,
                            there is no single unit under present Cypriot administrative system in
                            which Turks actually constitute majority. (We suggested this depended on
                            how one drew the lines.) In those areas where Turks are temporarily most
                            heavily concentrated, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            maintained economic factors alone would prevent continued existence
                            these concentrations: i.e. Turkish farm lands and properties are in many
                            cases remote from proprietors temporary abodes, while permanent
                            installation in these areas of temporary concentrations could only be
                            accomplished by dislocation long-term Greek residents.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, said <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> perfectly prepared accept
                            principles of Treaty Lausanne as applied to minority and would accept
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commissioners to supervise
                            application these principles. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could
                            not, however, accept arrangements which would in effect create and
                            perpetuate barriers between communities. Nikolareizis will be prepared
                            discuss this matter in depth with <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Discussion provisions for administration of Turkish Cypriots led directly
                            into discussion of role of Turkish military contingent. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> reiterated his thesis that
                            if indeed it were possible remove Turkish minority from island, it would
                            then be possible to grant sovereign military base to Turkey. However,
                            under special provisions for Turk ethnics outlined in <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> memo, taken in conjunction
                            with large sovereign military base, would only perpetuate and aggravate
                            errors London/Zurich Accords. He made it clear Greeks regard Turkish
                            military justifications for base as spurious. Nikolareizis commented
                            that Turkish demands for base area are larger than either one of the
                            British bases which have at various periods accommodated between 5,000
                            and 30,000 men. Neither <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> nor Nikolareizis denied, however, genuine
                            necessity devise some means avoid humiliation of Turks.</p>
                        <p> Nikolareizis said he expects return Geneva August 5.</p>

                            adds little new to our previous reports. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> has made it clear that in his mind a leased
                            base not categorically excluded. His authority to Nikolareizis to

                            Papandreou is actually more unyielding on this issue. My surmise is that
                            if agreement on other issues could be satisfactorily reached, Greeks
                            might be induced to agree to leased base provided it were moderate in
                            area and personnel. Greeks well aware that separate element of possible
                            agreement can be evaluated only as part of total package.</p>

                        <p>296. From <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. Had interim
                            sort of meeting with Turks this morning at my request for purpose of
                            preparing them for bad news it seems probable <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> will be bringing from
                            Athens. I told them I thought we were nearing moment of decision and
                            would not have a great deal of time left to reach agreement. Prospects
                            did not look very good to me. Although I did not know what sort of reply
                                <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> would bring, I
                            felt pretty sure it would not be satisfactory from Turkish point of
                            view. At same time, I also felt pretty sure it would not necessarily be
                            final Greek word.</p>
                        <p>Turks took this calmly and said it was really only what they had expected
                            from beginning. Sunalp emphasized belief that Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> were really working in
                            partnership to play for time until they could achieve their common
                            goal.</p>
                        <p>I then asked how much longer <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName>
                            felt he could continue conversation. I myself thought there was still
                            some hope but apparently he did not. If that was case, was he still
                            prepared to go on and for how long? He replied that would depend on me;
                            he was ready to keep talking until I myself became convinced that case
                            was hopeless. Implied that this conviction on my part would itself be
                            help to Turkish position, just as he had <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0253"/>thought my endorsement for need of Turkish military
                            presence on Cyprus had provided moral support which was useful even if

                        <p>315. From <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. Had long
                            and frustrating talk yesterday evening with <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName>. Essence of message he brought back from
                            Athens contained in three points:</p>
                        <p>1. My suggestions about safeguarding Turk-Cypriot rights, as set forth in
                            memorandum of July 24th,<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Reference is
                                presumably to <ref target="#d90">Document 90</ref>.</note> go too
                            far and would perpetuate division between Greek and Turk communities.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> considers objective should be to
                            eliminate this difference so that all Cypriots could live together in
                            peace and harmony.</p>
                        <p>2. Concession of sovereign area to Turkey is “out of the question”. Greek
                            Government renews offer of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            with Turkish troops and Commander. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> additionally authorized to explore concrete
                            elements which would be involved in leased base: such as area, purpose,
                            length of lease, number of troops to be accommodated, etc., but not
                            authorized make any commitment that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            would agree to such lease.</p>
                        <p>3. Injection of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> into
                            picture as result his latest visit to Athens and his public statements,
                            makes it impossible for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to continue
                            Geneva talks on basis independence for Cyprus. Talks on this basis would
                            require collaboration of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, who has made it clear he will not accept any
                            negotiated settlement. Therefore, only way we can proceed is on basis
                            that immediate result of talks will be enosis; on this assumption,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be discussing through me
                            disposition to be made of its own territory and thus not have to invite
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> handed me memorandum
                            evidently prepared in Athens on subject protection to Turkish minority.
                            It largely rejected proposals set forth my memorandum July 24th. Said
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could accept Lausanne-type
                            guarantees and U.N. commissioner, provided latter's functions were
                            “defined in detail”. Also could accept appointment two Turk-Cypriot
                            Eparchs but they must be on exactly same basis as Greek Eparchs and
                            there must be no separate system of administration for Turks, even at
                            Eparchy or village level. Central Turkish authority in Nicosia to look
                            after special rights of Turks throughout island was unacceptable as
                            producing form of partition and being “contrary to the reestablishment
                            of good administration and peace in the island”. Special Turkish courts
                            could be accepted only for application personal status <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0255"/>law; in all other respects, Turks must
                            be subject to ordinary, nonmixed courts.</p>
                        <p>I commented that this memorandum (copy being pouched)<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">Transmitted to the Department of State in airgram
                                A–63, August 7. (Ibid.)</note> was pretty bad. After some further
                            discussion it appeared that there might still be room for clarification
                            of my ideas and possible compromise. We therefore agreed to study this
                            and talk about it again after we have had time for reflection.</p>
                        <p>The base question: I pointed out any Turkish force on island must have
                            some physical location which would have to be granted to someone. This
                            someone could not be <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Since it was
                            not sovereign entity, therefore why not accept idea of long term lease
                            to Turkey, which might conceivably act as trustee for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in interest of Greek-Turkish and
                            general Western defense? I added this idea would be hard to sell to the
                            Turks but I would try. Went on to indicate extent of what appeared to be
                            present Turk minimum demands, i.e., whole of Karpas Peninsula plus north
                            coast as far as Akanthou Pass north of Lefkoniko. Also mentioned their
                            desire for port and airbase as well as problem which might arise if
                            peninsula proved to have substantial population.</p>
                        <p>I then advanced idea that Turkish base on Cyprus (and minority protection
                            as well) might be brought within the framework of larger Greek-Turkish
                            joint structure similar to that in effect between U.S. and Canada. This
                            could include joint defense board to discuss mutual problems of security
                            in Eastern Mediterranean as well as a political, economic and social
                            entity and perhaps other organs.</p>
                        <p>This would enable both Greece and Turkey to submerge their differences
                            over Cyprus and resume friendly cooperation which was so important to
                            them both. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> did not
                            comment specifically but seemed receptive to this idea.</p>
                        <p>We concluded discussion on base by my making appeal for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> assurance it prepared to discuss lease
                            in good faith so that I could have something solid to work on with
                            Turks. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> countered
                            that on his part he needed something concrete as to what we had in mind.
                            (I take it this means Papandreou unwilling to give him real authority
                            without knowing beforehand order of magnitude of base area proposed and
                            other characteristics of eventual arrangement.) <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> suggested starting from
                            premise that Turks now have 650 men on island and would need base large
                            enough only for that number. I said I thought Turks were thinking in
                            considerably larger terms, on order of one division. We agreed to
                            discuss this whole question further.</p>
                        <p>On matter of discussing enosis rather than Cypriot independence I said I
                            was in entire accord; it was Papandreou—not I—who had kept saying that
                            full and complete independence must be objective. <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName>
                            <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0256"/>said would be helpful if I
                            would put this strongly to Papandreou, possibly in letter. I said I
                            thought this was dangerous, since letter might fall into wrong hands and
                            I was already under grave suspicion as result <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' statements in Athens.
                            Thought my position on enosis had already been made clear both here and
                            by <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> in Athens. However,
                            I could probably get Labouisse to make further oral communication.</p>
                        <p>Our real problem in discussing enosis, I said, arose from Turkish
                            distrust of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and GOC. They seemed to
                            believe that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            Papandreou are in cahoots.<note n="4" xml:id="d103fn4">
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> expressed this view to

                                discussion was reported in telegram 202 from Ankara, August 4.
                                (Ibid.)</note> How could we prove to them case was otherwise? First
                            of all, we must reach agreement on substance of what was to happen after
                            enosis and secondly we must devise means to put this agreement into
                            effect without bringing about collapse of Turkish Government. We must
                            save Inonu, who was sole strong, moderate figure in Turkish regime. If
                            enosis brought about without any public indication that Greece and
                            Turkey had reached agreement safeguarding Turkey's minimum interest,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would certainly fall. Only way I
                            could think of was to have very general statement issued after agreement
                            reached and then quickly bring about enosis. But Papandreou would have
                            to give more than he had up to now to persuade Turks to stand still.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> asked me come in late
                            yesterday to brief him on “anything you have received since we last

                        <p>Since nothing had as yet been received in response his questions, I armed
                            myself with such new information as was available regarding more
                            favorable attitude of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            on freedom of movement of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peace force
                            and food distribution as reported by Nicosia and <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, as well as our own efforts and those
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in that regard. Also made inventory
                            of current developments in other fields mutual interest including
                            turning over second $40 million loan tranche, delivery of 104–G's and

                        <p>Contrary his wont, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> took
                            notes on these items and then observed fundamental question remained
                            what to do in rapidly deteriorating situation. He had lunched with Inonu
                            who had asked him tell me situation grave as result such GOC acts as
                            economic and physical blockade of Turks, obstructions to peace force in
                            fulfilling mission, continuing armed attacks on Turks, breakdown of
                            judiciary, territorial waters legislation, military secrets law, cutting
                            of Turkish water supply and attempted removal Turk Cypriot Amb here in
                            order replace by Turk Cypriot from Bonn and fill Bonn post with Greek.
                            He said Inonu had asked him say that continued GOC aggression could
                            result in Turk retaliation from air.</p>
                        <p>There ensued rather involved discussion in which I endeavored ascertain
                            whether <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> was talking about
                            reaction from cumulative frustration or as result some new development.
                            Using our relations with Soviet Union as example I pointed out that
                            there had been recurrent situations over the years when cumulative
                            friction had caused voices to be raised in advocacy of trial by arms but
                            we had resisted this even at the time when we had atomic monopoly. Other
                            examples abound; meeting <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0258"/>such
                            problems is real test statesmanship and diplomacy. To give up is to
                            shirk our job.</p>
                        <p>Also in such tense situation was important that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> keep careful watch on actions of Turk Cypriots. I had
                            just received several disquieting reports in this regard, one to effect
                            that people of Ktima had wanted pay water bill but had been prevented by
                            Turk “organization” and another indicating Turks responsible for fray
                            involving <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces in Nicosia (Nicosia's
                            175 to Dept).<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">Telegram 175 from Nicosia,
                                August 6, reported on exchanges of fire within the city of Nicosia.
                                (Department of State, Central Files, POL 23–8 CYP)</note> In drawing
                            attention to these, I realized that general pattern of incidents showed
                            predominance of Greek Cypriot instigation but would be deplorable if in
                            tense situation thus created spark would be supplied by some Turkish
                            initiative. Regardless of how it might come about, it could be made to
                            appear that it had been deliberately created to afford excuse for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> retaliation.</p>
                        <p>This was stiff stuff but <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            took it well, observing in latter connection he would get message off to
                            Cyprus immediately to enjoin restraint on Turks.</p>
                        <p>Re occasion for retaliation, Erkin inquired what had President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> meant when he spoke in
                            Washington talks of war as only last resort?<note n="4" xml:id="d104fn4">See <ref target="#d72">Document 72</ref>.</note> Also he already
                            being asked why U.S. should feel warranted in taking such strong action
                            in Vietnam (which he personally thought right) and at same time restrain
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> when it similarly inclined act
                            in its own interest. To this he had no answer.</p>
                        <p>Conversation then turned again to type of incident which might cause
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> retaliate and <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> mentioned, as he had in reftel,
                            situation which could arise if Geneva talks fail and enosis carried out
                            as purely Greek affair. Reference also made to danger of any substantial
                            move to subdue Turks and indicated this was what Inonu especially had in
                            mind when he warned of possible necessity of retaliation. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> renewed request for our views in
                            this regard (to be borne in mind that, aside from real desire consult,
                            these approaches could be cited as fulfilling our understanding re
                            consultation in event decision taken retaliate in some way).</p>
                        <p>Broadening conversation, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            then expressed great concern re deteriorating relations with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, saying that, if <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> returned to Geneva with
                            negative response, point of no return [would] have been reached between
                            Greece and Turkey since action such as removal Greek forces from
                            Bulgarian frontier to bolster strength versus Turks, illegal military
                            build-ups in Dodecanese and intensive naval patrols from Mytilene to
                            Rhodes would indicate that “Greece wants war”. Wouldn't I agree?</p>
                        <pb n="221" xml:id="pg_221" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>I said definitely not. In first place would be completely irrational in
                            view disparity between Greek and Turkish forces. Secondly, such
                            information as I had indicated Greeks don't want war and that this
                            feeling prevalent in Greek armed forces.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said this not assessment of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, citing public statements by
                            Papandreou re readiness reply militarily and report Greek Amb in Nicosia
                            had expressed opinion war inevitable. This why he was asking our views
                            since moment may come when too late for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to do anything. I said would submit to Dept but in
                            meantime had considerable confidence in my own appraisal and felt <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would be making serious mistake to
                            proceed assumption Athens actually picking fight.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> then brought up subject of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, recalling that in
                            previous conversation I had suggested would be mistake to assume that
                            public professions of identity of view between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Papandreou accurately
                            reflected basic relationship; also that I had suggested elements of
                            opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on island
                            as well. Relating to suggestions made in past to desirability of doing
                            something to remove <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            from picture, he said couldn't see how this could be done as result of
                            Turk-Greek agreement but would rather have to precede agreement since
                            seems <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> still in position
                            exert controlling influence on Athens. I said didn't wish get over my
                            head in unauthorized discussion but one thing seemed obvious, which was
                            that if Turkey and Greece should come to agreement on solution which
                            would involve enosis in one way or another, role of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would pretty much disappear.
                            Obviously intrigued by even mention this subject, i.e. elimination of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said still felt difficult reach
                            solution as long as <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            remained in power and speculated on possible move by <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to replace him. I asked if
                            there had been any contact by <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Erkin
                            said none; all that known is publicly announced intention of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to promote enosis while saying
                            steps would be taken safeguard Turkish community.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> concluded conversation by
                            making renewed appeal “to extract something from Washington” regarding
                            views and intentions of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> since, if
                            Geneva talks get nowhere, necessary devise alternatives for dealing with

                            useless; furthermore, Turkish attitude quite understandable. Finally,
                            that if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> asks, as it has done in

                            should give Lincoln's advice to Stanton (in view of Far East situation)
                            “one war at a time.” We are deeply involved on many fronts and Greeks
                            and Turks are not only people with domestic political problems. Whether
                            through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or otherwise I would be
                            against US military involvement in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Would also say to Greeks that if, as <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> suggested, move directly to enosis after
                            understanding reached with Turks is contemplated, danger of popular
                            upheaval Turkey could be overcome by announcement that Turkish forces
                            would shortly arrive not as enemies but by prior agreement and to aid in
                            orderly transition of Turkish Cypriots to enosis. They would thus
                            transform greatest hazard in path of enosis to important asset. It also
                            might even work, and help Inonu as suggested mytel 315.<note n="2" xml:id="d106fn2">

                            suggestion. Specifically we want to get here some one with power at home
                            authorized to work out a long-term lease of the peninsula—or any other
                            place—without any more nagging restrictions than the British have and
                            under some sort of organization like Canada-US Joint Defense Board. If
                            no Greek can come here perhaps Harry ought to fly up secretly in
                            military aircraft for talk with me and return to be a relaying station
                            in Athens. God only knows what N says I say.</p>
                        <p>Impossible for Ray to do anything unless a Greek first comes here bearing
                            a small gift or rather small downpayment on a rare bargain.</p>

                            both Greek Cypriot and Turk Cypriot in Mansoura area. President pointed
                            out that this was similar to suggestion he had made some time ago and
                            had even offered withdraw unilaterally if <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would take over Greek posts. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had been unable do so but perhaps if both sides gave up

                            maintain peace in area. <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> agreed this would be good idea and worth trying

                            a question along that line this morning. What do you think I ought to

                            there was no reason for your continued presence in Washington this

                        <p> LBJ: No, no. That's okay then. Now, what can this bring on as far as
                            we're concerned in Cyprus?</p>
                        <p> RSM: Well, I just talked to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George
                                Ball</persName> two minutes ago about it, and it's his feeling—and I
                            would certainly share it—that it would be wise to get <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> into Geneva<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">See <ref target="#d111">Document 111</ref>.</note>
                            immediately to talk to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. George had just finished a conversation with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> on the
                                telephone,<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">A memorandum of this
                                conversation is in the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library,

                                Cyprus.</note> hoping that possibly <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> could make some proposal here, possibly an overt
                            publicized proposal by the U.S. Government as to how the Greeks and the
                            Turks might settle their differences. Unless something like that's done,
                            it's very possible the whole place will go up in flames today.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: All right, then what do we do?</p>
                        <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0267"/>
                        <p> RSM: Well, the first thing to do is to get <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> up to Geneva so they can discuss this matter.
                            I say it may go up in flames today, I should really say this weekend. I
                            think we have, maybe, 12 to 48 hours here. So I'm getting an airplane
                            down to Athens to take <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName>
                            to Geneva, and State is working on some kind of a proposal that might be
                            made, really, along the lines that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> has already been proposing, which, in substance,
                            was something that looked as though both the Turks and the Greeks might
                            accept.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Why is Labouisse going down there, because he's the Ambassador to
                            Greece?</p>
                        <p> RSM: To advise on what the Turks, what the Greeks latest thinking
                            is.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: What they might do?</p>
                        <p> RSM: Yes.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Alright, now suppose—how does it go up in the flames. The Turks are
                            bombing the island?</p>
                        <p> RSM: The Turkish planes, as you know, strafed one of the harbors
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Yeah.</p>
                        <p> RSM: In response, it appears that the Greek Cypriots are attacking
                            Turkish Cypriot towns on Cyprus today. And they have the force at hand
                            to take those towns and destroy the Turkish Cypriots. The Turkish
                            Government is in a state of panic at the moment. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> has talked to <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName>,<note n="5" xml:id="d109fn5">See
                                    <ref target="#d104">Document 104</ref>.</note> our Ambassador,
                            and expressed great fear as to what will happen. The Turkish Government
                            just couldn't sit there and let the Turkish Cypriots on Cyprus be
                            slaughtered. They'd be forced to respond. But they apparently ran this
                            four-sortie attack, four-airplane attack, yesterday without having a
                            clear-cut plan as to how they would respond to a Greek Cypriot response.
                            It's a perfect illustration of starting something with too little force
                            and without knowing what you're going do when the other side kicks
                            back.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Now, how could we be involved?</p>
                        <p> RSM: Well, I don't think we would be involved militarily, Mr. President.
                            But I think that the diplomatic offense that <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">George Ball</persName> has in mind is the way we should act.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Alright.</p>

                        <p>1) Said he would send message Turk Charge Nicosia as requested by

                            Turk approval was for withdrawal both sides from posts inside and
                            outside villages affected and taking over by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on status quo ante basis, e.g. Greeks should return
                            Mansoura to Turks if occupied by them. He said this was point on which
                            Ministers felt very strongly last night, with many insisting <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> should otherwise resort to bombing.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> said he would clarify
                            again to Turk Charge and hoped we might assist in Nicosia as occasion
                            afforded. As matter stands <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            fears Markarios seeking hold villages occupied in which case turning

                            there is complete mutuality of action <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> prepared agree.</p>
                        <p>2) Essential that attacks not now be launched against Kokkina such as
                            made against Mansoura. This very important.</p>

                            last night. Most of Ministers were demanding immediate and strong
                            action, stressing that they represented will of people. Only advocates
                            of moderation were <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sunay</persName>. Otherwise drastic decisions would
                            have been taken last night since there was even opposition to recessing

                            maintaining certain “one up-manship” with other Cabinet members and
                            interesting to note that, whereas he has been avowed interventionist in

                            through the night. We thought we had it stabilized last night, but this
                            morning the Turks resumed their air strikes using napalm and 750-pound
                            bombs. They've got maybe 65 planes that they're using. And the <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> government has just told our
                            people in Nicosia that unless they stop within a half an hour, they're
                            going to turn on the whole Turk <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0270"/>Cypriot population on the island and attack them all over the island
                            with just a general massacre.<note n="2" xml:id="d111fn2">See <ref target="#d113">Document 113</ref>.</note> Now, we've gotten the
                            stiffest kind of notes—of messages—both to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>,<note n="3" xml:id="d111fn3">See <ref target="#d108">Document 108</ref>.</note> telling them they've
                            got to stop immediately while this is all sorted out. But what I wanted
                            to suggest was that I'm not at all sure that this thing is going to be
                            held, and it may blow up within the next few hours into one of the
                            bloodiest events we've seen in modern times, and I just wondered if your
                            people shouldn't be making preparations so you could get back here fast
                            if you have to do so.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Alright.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Now, I may, if it's agreeable with you, I may have to use your name
                            to Inonu in order to stop this. I don't think it will be necessary, but
                            if we can't get them to stand down, I'd like to be—have authority to do
                            it.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Sure, sure. I wouldn't think it would do much good, though.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, I'm not sure. This is the one hope we've got to get this
                            thing stopped before it turns into a general massacre. But these people
                            are all so bloodthirsty there's just no telling. And the military may be
                            out from under control, as far as <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> is concerned, in Turkey which is the other matter
                            that we don't know about.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: What did it look like last night?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, last night the bombing had been limited. And, actually, the
                            attack had been limited. They didn't use bombs. They used only rockets
                            and machine guns. And it looked as though the incident were closed. And
                            this was the impression that the Turks gave. But the Greek Cypriots
                            continued the fighting in these villages, apparently through the night,
                            and that was enough to set—give the Turk military an excuse to go
                            forward again today, and this time they're armored differently and with
                            napalm and 750-pound bombs, it's become a very serious business. They've
                            got a lot of the—a number of the villages are in flames, so that now the
                            one recourse that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has
                            is to threaten to use the Turk Cypriots on the island—all hundred
                            thousand of them—as his hostages and just massacre them unless this
                            thing stops. So that we've gotten, as they say, the toughest messages to
                            both sides. But whether they'll stop now with this bloodbath stuff, I
                            can't tell. It's very questionable. So that the thing may be out of
                            control. But, we're—doing my best. But in the meantime, I just have the
                            feeling that someone—the way the world will look at it, that there ought
                            to be preparations so you could move.</p>

                            it does, I would just want to raise the question with you as something
                            to consider.</p>

                        <p> GWB: He's on his way down now. I've been here all night. I've been in

                        <p> LBJ: Bob's in town too.</p>
                        <p> GWB: Bob's in town; I've been in touch with him. And with Bus Wheeler
                            and so on and so on.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: What are the possibilities—what else could we do?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Not much more, unless we wanted to intervene militarily, and I
                            don't think anybody wants to do that. We're going to get the Sixth Fleet
                            moved over closer, at least—just got a call in to Bob to talk to him
                            about it now. We've got destroyers standing off Cyprus to take our own
                            people off—there are about 350 Americans on the island—if it comes to
                            that. But beyond that I don't know what we could do. The Security
                            Council was in emergency session until 1:30 this morning but adjourned
                            without coming to any decision. At that time, it looked as though the
                            Turks were going to quit and this was an incident which we could then
                            use to sort things out diplomatically. But the Turks have overplayed
                            their hand and apparently the military may be out of control, so that
                            it's going to be very hard to do anything. The Greek Cypriots called in
                            or advised our fellow late last night, which was 2:30 o'clock over
                            there, that they had asked the Soviet Union to intervene
                                militarily.<note n="5" xml:id="d111fn5">In telegram 219 from

                            to put them on guard, and we'll have to watch this during the day, so
                            we're alerting the fleets to be on guard.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: What'd we say to Moscow?</p>
                        <p> GWB: I just notified the Embassy there to find out everything they
                            could, but we didn't want to take any strong line because there was no
                            indication of any favorable response on Moscow's part.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: What do the British say?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, the British are in the position of taking orders from us.
                            We're really getting nothing from them of a substantive kind, although
                            we're keeping them on—of course, they've all gone away for a weekend
                            over in London, as usual. <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName>
                            is out on an island somewhere, and I think Home is away from London,
                            too. And they are partly inaccessible. But we're keeping the government
                            informed, and, actually, I made use of <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0272"/>the government planes last night to get them scrambled
                            up off the island to have a look around to see what Turkish forces were
                            in the vicinity. There's nothing, so far, of sea forces except about
                            half a dozen destroyers that they have standing off. But there's no
                            question that they're all loaded and ready to go as far as a land
                            invasion is concerned. They've been making preparations for the last 24
                            hours, and this is a culmination of several weeks ago.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: What does <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            say?</p>
                        <p> GWB: I talked to him last night<note n="6" xml:id="d111fn6">A memorandum
                                of this conversation is in the <persName>Johnson</persName> Library,

                                Cyprus.</note> and he was fairly relaxed, but, of course, that was
                            before this last attack. Now, I sent—I got a plane through Bob and sent
                            Harry Labouisse up late last night to have a talk with <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> so that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>, I mean <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> could come back to see
                            Papandreou with a strong note from <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> about the possibility of settling and the need
                            to settle immediately. <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName>
                            is back in Athens now. The Greek Government so far has behaved quite
                            well. Papandreou called on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to stop the fighting last night but,
                            apparently, without success. He has now summoned <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to come back to Athens. And it
                            was our hope in the earlier hours this morning that he would work out
                            some kind of a means of getting rid of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> so that this matter could be settled between
                            the Greek and Turk Governments. But the Turks are overplaying their hand
                            so badly that it may be very hard to put it back together now. But we'll
                            keep working on it.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Now what are the one or two possible alternatives? Our intervention
                            would be one. You can rule that out. Any—what else?</p>
                        <p> GWB: I don't think from a military intervention point of view, there's
                            anything that can be done because there's no United Nations force that
                            could be gotten together for this purpose. Of course, if the Soviet
                            Union—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Well now, why not? Why not? Why couldn't the United Nations—why
                            wouldn't that be something to at least pursue or hold out hope on?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, I think—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: you mean, just realistically, they don't have them, but couldn't
                            we—?</p>
                        <p> GWB: They simply won't do it. That's all I mean. There are 6,000 <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops in there now, but the orders that
                            all the component governments have given to their own elements is that
                            if an invasion should start, they would retire into the British bases
                            and not stop it, because with 6,000 men they are not capable of stopping
                            a Turkish invasion. And anyway, there isn't a one of the United Nations
                            forces that's in there that's prepared to fight the Turks.</p>
                        <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0273"/>
                        <p> LBJ: Well, is there any possibility that we could get the governments to
                            agree to do that, and we could tell the Turks that we're going—that the
                            United Nations is going to be fighting you if you don't stay away?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, realistically with the experience we've had in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> of even getting the 6,000 and the
                            nervous—the Canadians calling us every hour and saying they want to pull
                            out, and the Swedes threatening to pull out, there's no member of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, I think, that's going to be
                            willing to put up any forces against a Turkish invasion. I think the
                            best bet there is just to use the biggest, the toughest leverage we have
                            on the Turks. If we can't stop them, why we'll just have to cordon off
                            the island and let the thing settle down itself. Because I don't think
                            there's any way of putting outside forces between the Turks and the
                            Greeks if they really get at it, without—I don't think there's anybody
                            prepared to put forces into a situation like that.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Well, UN intervention, our intervention—what else is
                            conceivable?</p>
                        <p> GWB: On the military side, I think that the best thing we could do is to
                            make sure that the Soviet Union doesn't do anything. But as far as
                            trying to stop it, the only other way to stop it then is just to tell
                            the Turk Government, which I already have, that they're going to be
                            condemned in the eyes of the world by all civilized nations if they go
                            ahead, in the face of the threat of a massacre, and precipitate it. And
                            I've told the Government of Cyprus that if they go ahead with a massacre
                            of this kind, they will be condemned as murderers by all civilized
                            people. That we are working very hard with both governments—with the
                            Turkish Government that gets the planes stood down. And if there's any
                            civilian control left in the Turkish Government, I think we could
                            probably do it. It's—but apart from that, there's no way we can stop
                            this fighting because there's no available force that can go in and get
                            in the middle of it. And, actually, for an outside force to come in—once
                            this massacre starts, it's hopeless. I mean, if you had 50,000 men and
                            put them in, you couldn't stop the bloodshed, because it's going on and
                            it will go on in every little village all over the place. And a major
                            force would only exacerbate it, actually, if they came in from outside.
                            We just have to live through it and pick up the pieces. But it's a
                            mess.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Well, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention, our
                            intervention—I guess you've got to consider the likelihood of Soviet
                            intervention, haven't you?</p>
                        <p> GWB: We've considered it very hard and we've looked at it very long and
                            we don't think at all it's going to happen. But, nevertheless, we're
                            going to try—we're going to get some fleet units up there just to be on
                            guard if anything should occur. It would be very hard for them to
                            intervene, almost impossible—except by air. They couldn't put enough
                            ashore by submarine to do it and they can't get their—any naval units
                            out there. They would just be exposing themselves in a way they never
                                <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0274"/>would. I don't think—they
                            have told the Turks, within the last week, that if the Turks intervened
                            they wouldn't do anything about it. And I don't, for a minute, think
                            that they're going to respond to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' call. We're going to take every prudent act to
                            make sure that they don't, but I just don't see any serious possibility
                            of it.</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Now, what are we waiting on to take our people off?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Well, I think we—</p>
                        <p> LBJ: Do we have the facilities there to do it now?</p>
                        <p> GWB: Yeah, We've got a destroyer standing offshore. We've got the
                            airlifts all set up. The best way to evacuate them is by air. I'm—I hope
                            that—we've got about a half an hour to play with here—and I hope that we
                            won't have to pull them off in a wholesale way because it could even
                            make the—it might trigger the thing. But they're pretty secure. I mean,
                            it's as badly an exposed situation as it is [inaudible].</p>

                        <p> GWB: Well, we can get the Turks to stay away from our people, I think.

                        <p>238. From <persName corresp="#p_AN1">Anschuetz</persName>. Have just seen
                            Papandreou at his request. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> (Fon Affairs) and <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> (Defense) also present.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had received
                            telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            demanding intervention of Greek aircraft to repel Turk bombings which
                            resumed this morning. Papandreou alluded to his statement last night
                            which he said constituted formal repudiation of Markarios' policy.
                            Fighting has now stopped, however and Turkish action is putting <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> in untenable position. Whatever one
                            might think of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he is
                                <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0275"/>apparently in the right in
                            this instance, and public opinion in Greece and in Cyprus will not
                            permit <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> stand aside indefinitely.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> had telephoned
                            demanding formal declaration of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            support by one thirty today failing which GOC would have no alternative
                            but to seek help elsewhere. Papandreou appealed to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> halt Turkish attacks. Assured
                            Papandreou <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> was exerting its best
                            efforts. Pointed out direct and immediate Soviet or UAR intervention
                            seemed rather unlikely and requested assurance that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> armed forces would not be engaged
                            without further consultation with us. This assurance was given, but with
                            insistence that next few hours would be extremely critical for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. I commented that awkward as is present
                            position <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, actual engagement Greek
                            armed forces would be infinitely more serious.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> is returning within the hour.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> at a loss understand how
                            Kokkina-Mansoura affair had gotten out of control despite best efforts
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. Garofoulias asserted no Greek
                            nationals involved this affair.</p>
                        <p>All three Greeks were in rather emotional state. I assured them I would
                            be in touch with them later today.</p>

                        <p>165. Just seen President in urgent last minute appeal to him, order
                            cease-fire in order avoid further spread of violence. After making
                            numerous points and expressing my real regret that we had not taken
                            advantage of cease-fire which lasted almost 18 hours, I urged him in
                            spite of reports which he had recounted of destruction of Greek villages
                            as distinct from any military targets, make urgent announcement of
                            cease-fire using whatever justification needed which would put GOC in
                            best possible <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0276"/>light. As he was
                            saying “Do you think that Turks would stop if I did so?” aide came in to
                            announce 2 further air strikes by 4 and 7 planes respectively on
                            villages of Pamos and Kato Pyrgos setting center of towns afire. With
                            this news President turned to me with hopeless shrug and said “What can
                            I do?”</p>
                        <p>I suggested that he and his Ministers were putting <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in impossible position by using US as
                            means of transmittal of “ultimatum” for two reasons (1) time element too
                            short and (2) Turks unlikely respond this sort of threat. I urged him
                            again in most urgent tones reconsider this terrible decision so fraught
                            with dangers for his people.</p>
                        <p>I said I would do what I could but I was not at all hopeful that
                            restrictions which he had placed on situation would make possible a
                            favorable outcome. As he accompanied me to door I asked again regarding
                            time limit and he indicated 1:30 GMT.</p>
                        <p>We at Nicosia recognize that if US successfully stops Turks on this
                            occasion and in response this type ultimatum we will henceforth be held
                            responsible for controlling Turks and subject this type of blackmail.
                            However even so I believe we must make every conceivable effort obtain
                            at least temporary cessation of bombing in order not to create holocaust
                            on this island with all its ultimate consequences for our alliances not
                            only in area but elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>224. For Ambassador from <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>.
                            Please approach Papandreou urgently and make following points:</p>
                        <p>1. In spite of what GOC may have told him, they officially advised us
                            last night that they were calling on the Soviet Union for military
                            intervention; they confirmed this advice to the British Government. It
                            is utterly essential that Papandreou concert with <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to insure that no Soviet,
                            Egyptian or other armed forces be introduced into the island.</p>
                        <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0277"/>
                        <p>2. The situation in Cyprus is on the verge of holocaust. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has threatened a general
                            massacre if the Turkish attacks do not stop. We are urgently trying to
                            get the Turk planes to stand down and at the same time are pointing out
                            to GOC that they will be regarded as murderers if they loose an attack
                            on Turk Cypriot population generally.</p>
                        <p>3. Under these circumstances Papandreou must show his leadership by
                            stopping the fighting on the island and getting <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> under control. We will do all
                            possible to stop the further Turkish offensive but Papandreou must get
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and his men in
                            hand.</p>
                        <p>4. Above all Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            must now promptly settle this matter along the lines of the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposals. There is no
                            longer time for horse-trading or equivocation or passionate oratory.
                            This is a time for calm heads, incisive action and rational
                            leadership.</p>
                        <p>5. Tell Papandreou that all of us, including President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, have greatly admired his
                            restraint so far and the message that he sent to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> last night.<note n="2" xml:id="d114fn2">In his August 8 letter, Papandreou appealed to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to cease

                            to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> who had said unable do
                            so. I then asked see <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> to
                            deliver your message and <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            and I went to his house together.</p>
                        <p>He was friendly but tough, saying every hour given <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is used for evil and he
                            unwilling give him any more time. As for today didn't expect there would
                            be much if any more air activity due to advanced hour. What he would
                            agree to is to call off further air strikes if by tomorrow morning
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> stops attacks at
                            Kokkina and agrees to eventual withdrawal from area occupied by Greeks.
                            This to be followed by agreement restore peace immediately on whole of
                            island.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> said felt confident this
                            could be done if put to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            straight and hard. Time serves no purpose with him. Overnight will be
                            time enough. He insisted on sunrise as expiration period put this over.
                            I said couldn't see how this could possibly work since would give no
                            time for exchange views in morning. In end he agreed I should see
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> at nine o'clock
                            tomorrow morning to determine where we stand. This was maximum I could
                            wring out of him.<note n="3" xml:id="d115fn3">The Department reported

                                (Ibid.)</note> am now awaiting results this latest approach. Am
                            loathe to hit him again with same issue complicated by new conditions
                            apparently being imposed by Inonu. Furthermore, I feel I must consult
                            with my British colleague who has been instrumental in obtaining two
                            postponements of dire action previously planned by Greek Cypriots.
                            British High Commissioner's approach and his messages to Ankara and to
                            London spoke only of cease-fire in Kokkina for purpose of subsequent
                            negotiations. Am seeing Bishop at once for this purpose and hopefully by
                            the time I return we will have some indication GOC response to message
                            from Security Council President. We still have a few hours in which to
                            make ultimate pitch.</p>
                        <p>My own belief is that injection of conditions on top Security Council
                            President's appeal might throw whole [garble] assuming there is chance
                            of favorable reply from <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d116fn3">In telegram 121 to

                            he found the text excellent and was prepared to publish it.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou launched into a long analysis of the situation in Cyprus.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had an agreement with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> that they were to indulge in no
                            military operations except with the approval of the Greek Government.
                            Both <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> violated that agreement.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had probably
                            planned the operation in the Mansoura area for some time, and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> was dragged along because he
                            was attracted by the military advantages of eliminating the Turkish
                            beachhead there. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had transmitted
                            three messages to Cyprus with regard to fighting in this area. First was
                            a telegraphic message Saturday morning August 7, the second a telephone
                            call and last night the written message which was published (Embtel 235
                            to Department).<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">Dated August 8. (Department
                                of State, Central Files, POL 23–8 CYP)</note> Last message was
                            public repudiation of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' actions have
                            demonstrated that it will be impossible to have a common or parallel
                            policy with him.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou stated that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>
                            had been offended by his messages and had said he would resign
                                (<persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> tender of
                            resignation confirmed by [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>]).</p>
                        <p> Papandreou said that in light <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>
                            action the Turks were right in staging their demonstration yesterday.
                            Today with cease-fire of the Greek Cypriots, the situation is reversed
                            and the Turkish attack without justification. If Turks will guarantee to
                            discontinue their attacks, Greek Government will accept responsibility
                            for maintaining cease-fire. (When asked if he could ensure this, he
                            replied he believed he could.) Tonight may be a terrible night in Cyprus
                            because the Cypriots consider they are abandoned. And it is reported
                            that Georgatsis might organize some activity against Turk Cypriots. The
                            only activity which the Greeks have taken today was what he called the
                            theatrical demonstration of four planes which flew over Cyprus to
                            reassure the Greek Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>If it is possible to obtain Turkish assurances to desist, both sides
                            should accept authority of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>.
                            Moreover, appeal of Chairman Security Council<note n="4" xml:id="d117fn4">On August 9, the President of the U.N. Security
                                Council appealed to Turkey to end the use of military force.</note>
                            <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0281"/>provides an additional basis
                            for insisting upon a cease-fire. With a cease-fire Papandreou said it
                            would be possible to move promptly toward a basic solution of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>I seized on this to emphasize US conviction necessary to reach settlement
                            all issues with Turks in shortest possible time.</p>
                        <p>I covered briefly my discussion with <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> in Geneva. I took general line agreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and will follow
                            up tomorrow at another meeting with Prime Minister scheduled for
                            noon.</p>
                        <p>It was clear to me that Papandreou prepared to accept some sort of lease
                            arrangement although question of size, etc. will still pose problems. I
                            believe he fully understands urgent need for agreed solution. As he was
                            very tired and clearly showed strain of recent days, I told him that I
                            would wait until our meeting tomorrow for full discussion.</p>
                        <p>I hope Geneva will send revisions of draft agreement in time for
                            tomorrow's meeting.</p>

                                Resolution 193 (1964) on Cyprus and instructed the Embassy to
                                underline to Turkish officials the resolution's evenhandedness and
                                the need for Turkish restraint. (Ibid.) The resolution, sponsored by
                                the United States and United Kingdom, was adopted on August 9 by
                                vote of 9 to 0, with 2 abstentions (Czechoslovakia and the Soviet

                            withdrawal of Greeks from Mansoura complex and restoration of status quo

                        <p>Without such agreement, <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution
                            would merely guarantee gains made by Greeks and he reluctant even submit
                            such proposal for consideration of Cabinet. He felt we had let <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> down very badly. Also there had been no
                            mention whatsoever re expediting Geneva negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I said felt <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> looking at
                            situation through wrong end of telescope. <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had mentioned four points: 1) cessation Greek
                            attacks; 2) withdrawal by Greeks to position before attacks; 3) general
                            peace in Cyprus; 4) speeding up Geneva talks. Security Council
                            resolution covered points 1 and 3 and I knew for certainty that point 4
                            in train. This left only point 2, which obviously important from <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> viewpoint, but I saw nothing in
                            resolution contrary to it. Possibly full knowledge of what took place
                            either in New York or collaterally would reveal that progress made on
                            this point of which I unaware. But in any event I saw no reason why
                            subject couldn't be pursued and I would ask urgently for further
                            guidance from Washington.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I gave him a copy of Cyprus “Gridiron” for Aug 8<note n="3" xml:id="d118fn3">Not further identified.</note> indicating full

                            had refused but now would be put on spot by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution giving Greeks all they want except possibly

                            must assume responsibility of accomplishment, or Turks should be allowed

                            seems dangling on this thread. Fact that Gridiron Aug 8 would indicate

                            the events of recent days and concluded with a report that a cease-fire
                            appeared now to be accepted, although fragile and precarious. In this
                            situation, he felt that the prospects for successful negotiations were
                            somewhat less gloomy than they have been. He reported that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> in Geneva was encouraged,
                            that the Greeks have adopted a serious negotiating position and had
                            added a serious negotiator, Sossides, to the Geneva operation. In
                            summary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> believed that
                            we should press to make the cease-fire stick, and move forward with Mr.

                        <p>260. 1. At meeting with Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> yesterday, I went over same general ground
                            touched on in Sunday night meeting concerning Geneva conversations,<note n="2" xml:id="d120fn2">See <ref target="#d117">Document
                                117</ref>.</note> but in more detail. I again stressed that US Govt
                            considered it essential we drive swiftly toward basic long-term
                            solution; pointing to deadly serious prospects in event of failure; that
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> considered Turks
                            had moved very considerable distance from their original demands for
                            partition or federation, but that we did not consider <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had moved much from position of six
                            weeks ago; that, while <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and Nikolareizis were on best of terms,
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> did not feel
                            latter had sufficient authority to move things forward, that there was
                            too much tendency to explore in principle, and that there was apparently
                            some failure of communications between Nikolareizis and Athens as
                            witnessed by Nikolareizis' reported acceptance by Papandreou of
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s minorities
                            proposal and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> subsequent apparent
                            reversal. The situation was much too dangerous to drift any longer in
                            this way. We must get down to cases and work out practical arrangements
                            this week. I suggested that Greeks were in way of obtaining large part
                            of what they want provided they make reasonable concessions to meet
                            Turks on questions of minority protection and military security which to
                            them are very real. After going over main points of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s memo for his August 10
                            talk with Nikolareizis,<note n="3" xml:id="d120fn3">See <ref target="#d120fn2">footnote 2</ref>, Document <ref target="#d121">121</ref>.</note> the draft Defense Board “treaty” was
                            translated to Papandreou by his son who had joined meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. Papandreou acknowledged that Nikolareizis' instructions had been to
                            explore possible solution which was reason he had not been able be more
                            forthcoming, but he agreed on need to move on urgently. His initial
                            reaction to the Defense Board concept was that it was something for
                            future, and that we should concentrate on key issues (a) treatment of
                            minorities and (b) question of base. I replied that I was sure <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> was not wedded to Defense
                            Board concept as end in itself, but considered it as a proven and
                            reasonable means for handling problems before us, adding that getting
                            down to key issues was just what Acheson had been seeking to do and was
                            pressing Greeks for now.</p>
                        <p>3. On base question, Papandreou clearly indicated acceptance of lease
                            arrangement, ruling out concept of transformation of British bases<pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0285"/> as too complicated, etc. I
                            urged that he react quickly to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s proposals on this, adding that the twenty
                            square kilometer suggestion was much too small to be considered. (He
                            then discussed privately in Greek with <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> size of present British bases.) When I
                            alluded to Karpas Peninsula, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> asked what would happen to inhabitants. I
                            said all this was matter for negotiation. (Incidentally, I am told
                            British base areas include previously existing villages.)</p>
                        <p>4. On minority rights, Papandreou made much the same noises as in past,
                            agreeing to provide solid bill of human rights with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision and rights of appeal to Hague
                            Court. He said he would consider anything which did not smack either of
                            federation or cantonments. Referring to my comments re Nikolareizis'
                            transmission of his views, he said there had surely been
                            mistake—“possibly Nikolareizis was being too agreeable.” Papandreou said
                            that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> memo on
                            minorities although entitled enosis was in substance partition and
                            federation. This was impossible for Cypriot people to accept and recent
                            events did not make it easier. He said <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> must remember that, even when <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is out of picture, the
                            Cypriot people will have strong ideas which cannot be dismissed. He
                            stressed point that often US fails to distinguish between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and the will of the mass of
                            people of island.</p>
                        <p>5. Conversation ended by his asking for copy of Defense Board treaty,
                            saying that Sossides was expected back from Geneva in evening and that
                            he would talk with him with view to pressing forward constructively. I
                            shall follow up.</p>
                        <p>6. I also talked to King Constantine in general terms about urgent need
                            for agreed solution which would take fully into consideration Turkey's
                            military requirements and prestige, as well as protection of minorities
                            rights. He agreed except concerning Turkey's argument re need of base
                            for its military security. This was outmoded military concept, but he
                            did agree that Turkey needed something for prestige reasons provided
                            there was no disguised partition or federation. I said it was most
                            important for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to be more flexible
                            and forthcoming in Geneva talks, and he undertook to help in this
                            direction. When I suggested that it might prove helpful in final
                            analysis to get major opposition leadership committed to anything
                            government agrees to, the King replied he was satisfied he could bring
                            this about.</p>

                            seem feel strongly one way or the other, observing that agreement on
                            specifics has priority and inquiring if I had anything new to put
                            forward in that regard. I said I didn't but stressed fact that Greek
                            reps now showing disposition get down to brass tacks. This did not mean
                            that margin of difference in substance had been decreased; far from it.
                            But it did mean that for first time it may be possible really to come to

                        <p>When I got through, both <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> and
                            Sunalp made it very clear that Greek position was unacceptable.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> pointed out proposal
                            involved complete abandonment of London-Zurich Agreements, especially
                            concept of separate Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus. Turks had
                            been willing to accept changes, in agreements, but only on condition
                            that every change in favor of Greece was balanced by something for
                            Turkey. No <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, he said, could accept
                            what Greeks were now proposing. Turkish people would not stand for it.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> was already under heavy pressure
                            from public opinion and army which considered it was not tough enough.
                            It would not be realistic for him to discuss with me what Greeks had
                            offered. In any case, he had authority from Ankara only to talk on basis
                            of my own earlier proposals; anything else, he said, he would have to
                            refer to Ankara, and he would do this with report I had just given
                            him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> went on to reiterate that my
                            proposals were about the least Turkey could have considered. Sunalp
                            interjected that Greek base suggestion was ridiculous and that Greeks
                            were “being comic” in putting it forward. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> emphasized that he was prepared to continue
                            discussion on basis my suggestions provided Greeks would do likewise. If
                            they did not, Turkey would have to make its own proposals. In this
                            connection he gave us map of Cyprus showing four zones. First enclosed
                            all of Karpas Peninsula and something more, which he said would be
                            Turkish military base. Second enclosed area stretching from Famagusta
                                <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0289"/>through northern Nicosia
                            and up to north coast between Kyrenia and Lapithos; this, he said, would
                            be Turkish territory but demilitarized. Third covered everything south
                            and west of this line down to a line drawn along watershed from Pomos on
                            coast of Tylliria through Mt. Olympus southwestward to coast at Petounda
                            Point, between Larnaca and Limassol. This zone would be Greek but
                            demilitarized. Fourth zone began from this line and covered rest of
                            island, which he said would be Greek without limitation.</p>
                        <p>I commented this was merely another form of partition and left us where
                            we were six weeks ago.</p>
                        <p>We had back-and-forth discussion for some time. I admitted Greeks had
                            been slow to make proposals and had refused to accept my ideas. But what
                            was the alternative to reaching agreement somewhere along their lines? I
                            was convinced that there would very soon be a major fresh outbreak of
                            violence on Cyprus. Sunalp agreed and said violence would come from
                            Turkey too. “Then what?”, I said. There would be a first-class mess.
                            Suggested they should start from broad Greek-Turkish treaty I had put
                            forward and thus get everything in far wider context. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said this was all very well but
                            Turkey could not accept it if price was enosis. They could not trust
                            Greece to keep any agreement, look at how quickly <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had repudiated London-Zurich. It would
                            be better for Turkey to stand on London-Zurich than to accept what
                            Greeks were proposing.</p>
                        <p>I said if Cyprus case went to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> there
                            would certainly be resolution calling for full and complete
                            independence. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> objected GA
                            could not terminate treaties. I agreed but said nevertheless it would do
                            so. Turkey would have to fight to block full Cypriot independence. To
                            this, Erim replied it would be better for internal position <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to accept independence under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution than to go along with Greek
                            proposition. He thought GA should be stopped, in any case, from ignoring
                            Turkish rights, because it had recognized them by resolutions passed in
                            1957 and 1958. I pointed out GA would not be likely to be influenced by
                            this. I added that Turkey could not afford to wait for Assembly to meet;
                            major trouble in Cyprus would happen long before that. Sunalp said
                            Turkey would intervene.</p>
                        <p>Throughout discussion I kept bearing down as strongly as I could on
                            disastrous results of failure to reach agreement and inevitable
                            consequent Greek-Turkish war. Turks repeatedly assured me they
                            understood this and did not want war. Nevertheless, they were not afraid
                            of war and did not see why they should be ones to make all concessions
                            while Greeks made none. Sunalp commented that he hated war, having been
                            in one (Korean) but also hated to see Turkey lose its rights and have
                            its people suffer on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>I observed that there was no way of telling where war would end; Russia
                            might intervene. Turks should recognize that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was like <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0290"/>mad man whom Greeks could not stop.
                            They had made grave mistake in giving him so much leeway. To this Sunalp
                            remarked Turkey would have to pay for their mistake; I agreed but added
                            that if Turkey made a grave mistake of its own in going to war it would
                            have to pay for that too.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to me that the only alternatives left were violence and war on
                            the one hand and acceptance of something like the Greek proposals on the
                            other. The latter would at least get rid of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Turks should realize they could not get
                            anything resembling partition from Greeks. Sunalp retorted that Greeks
                            could not get enosis from Turkey. I said I realized it was tough
                            decision for them to make, but there it was.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I asked <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> if he
                            wanted me to tell Greeks that their offer of base at Cape Greco was
                            totally unacceptable, or if he wanted to consult Ankara first. He said I
                            should go ahead and tell them. Even with regard to whole Karpas
                            Peninsula, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had rejected idea of
                            leased base, and it would find present Greek proposal quite out of
                            question. I said I would talk to Greeks again today and see Turks again
                            tomorrow or Monday.</p>

                                <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note> Saw Greeks again this
                            afternoon and gave them Turkish reaction to their counter proposal. I
                            will not bother Dept with details, but I made it very clear that Turks
                            considered proposal ridiculous and quite unacceptable and that they had
                            said that they were prepared to talk only on basis of my proposals (by
                            which they meant whole of Karpas Peninsula plus my original ideas of
                            minority rights and safeguards) or on basis counter proposal of
                            partition. To illustrate latter, I showed Greeks map Turks had given me
                            this morning (para four reftel). Added Turks insisted that they would
                            only consider sovereign base area, not lease, although I thought there
                            was <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0291"/>bare chance they might
                            accept lease if terms and base area were satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Essence of Greek reaction was that Turks clearly wanted more than
                            military base, they wanted what was in effect form of partition. This
                            Greece could never concede because it would be totally rejected by Greek
                            people as well as by Cypriots. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would
                            enlarge its Cape Greco offer if that were necessary from purely military
                            point of view to accommodate adequate air and naval base, but it could
                            not go beyond that.</p>
                        <p>We went round and round most of the old arguments about asserted Turkish
                            unreasonableness, lack of Turkish right of intervention, domestic
                            troubles of Papandreou, etc. I assured <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> that I had done my best to convince Turks that
                            they should take lesser of evils and accept something like what Greeks
                            offer as better than war. However, I said, I did not believe I had made
                            any impact. I feared we had come to end of rope. Greeks seemed to agree
                            with me. They put forward no new suggestions and held out no hope that
                            further consultation in Athens would bring anything forth.</p>
                        <p>We finally asked whether there was no chance at all of Greek Govt
                            considering whole or part of Karpas Peninsula as Turkish base on
                            long-term lease. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> thought
                            there was no chance of granting anything more on that peninsula than
                            could be offered in Cape Greco region. What Turks wanted, he said (and I
                            agreed), was something resembling partition, which is a good deal more
                            than would be needed for military base. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> simply could not meet this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> went on that in these
                            circumstances, with all hope gone in Geneva, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would have to drop its plans to work actively for
                            enosis and would give full support to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in his drive for full and complete
                            independence. We questioned why this need be. He said Greece would have
                            no basis for enosis campaign if there were no agreement with Turkey. If
                            it staged coup d'etat, this would precipitate war with Turkey. We
                            suggested war would probably come anyway, because <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would do things on Cyprus
                            that would bring about Turkish intervention. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName>, however, thought that if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> were relieved of his fear of
                            negotiated settlement he would be willing to hold his hand on the island
                            until General Assembly met, avoiding unbearable provocation of Turks,
                            and would get his full independence endorsed by GA.</p>
                        <p>I suggested that <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> should go
                            back to Athens tomorrow and put to Papandreou two possible alternatives:
                            (a) Greece should try to keep negotiations alive by agreeing to discuss
                            Turkish area on Karpas Peninsula, or (b) it should abandon Geneva talks
                            and concentrate on keeping <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> quiet. Independent Cyprus under <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would be pretty bad, but it
                            would probably be better than Greek-Turkish war. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> seemed to agree.</p>

                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> In light of today's meetings, I come to
                            two pretty firm conclusions:</p>
                        <p>(a) Turks won't accept Greek proposals and there is no use talking about
                            them further; on other hand, Turks will take my proposals as basis for
                            discussion and will probably be flexible as to western boundary of
                            Karpas Peninsula area although apparently inflexible on question of
                            lease instead of sovereignty. (There is less than 50–50 chance they
                            would talk about lease.)</p>
                        <p>(b) Greeks will probably not accept anything like whole of Karpas
                            Peninsula for Turkey, if indeed they will accept any part of it, and
                            will be inflexible re sovereignty issue.</p>
                        <p>This leaves us with not much of anywhere to go. Question is should we
                            accept failure and look for best way to terminate talks, or should we
                            try to continue until something happens on Cyprus to blow everything up?
                            Argument for first course is that chance of avoiding violence and
                            consequent Turkish intervention might be increased if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> knew Geneva talks were dead
                            and he would probably get <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> support
                            for independence. Arguments for second course are simply good old
                            bulldog spirit and chance miracle will happen.</p>
                        <p>In any event, I would not propose to leave Geneva before Mediator returns
                            from his trip next Friday. I shall see him tonight or tomorrow morning
                            to report. When we do leave, I would imagine best course would be for me
                            to say nothing here and Dept simply to say that I am coming for
                            consultation and that timing of my return to Geneva is uncertain.</p>
                        <p>Would be glad to have comments and reactions of addressees.</p>

                            a.m. These are my night thoughts after reflecting on our teletype

                        <p>1. I am inclined to feel that we may have misread the emphasis in your
                                383.<note n="3" xml:id="d125fn3">
                                <ref target="#d123">Document 123</ref>.</note> The Turkish
                            counter-proposal put forward by Erim seemed even more extreme than the
                            original Turkish position. The saving aspect of <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName>'s presentation, which we may have
                            overlooked, was a reaffirmation of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            willingness to continue negotiations on basis your suggestions. A
                            disturbing aspect was Sunalp's presence as a kind of military commissar
                            and his assertiveness, which indicates that Turk military are a force
                            threatening to become a discrete sovereignty not wholly under <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s control.</p>
                        <p>2. At this point, it seems essential to put leash on ebullient Turk
                            military while moving at the same time to push a thoroughly scared
                            Papandreou into serious negotiations on basis your proposals.</p>
                        <p>3. Hope of success would seem to imply that neither Greeks nor Turks take
                            your proposals as a minimum which each must improve to satisfy its own
                            requirements. If Turks accept leasehold rather than sovereignty then
                            Greeks must exhibit territorial generosity. Whether Papandreou, who is
                            both old and in bad health, could carry it off remains to be seen. But,
                            in any event, Greeks must be told that your proposals remain the basis
                            for negotiation since their counter-proposals have proved abortive.</p>
                        <p>4. The situation as of tonight seems precarious in the extreme. Even with
                            luck we may be only four or five days away from an explosion. The signs
                            pointing to this are the following:</p>
                        <p>a. The Turkish military have tasted blood. They are full of cockiness and
                            apparently obsessed with the desire to finish the job they started last
                            weekend. Their military plans are hair-raising since they would involve
                            among other things taking out all airfields on the Greek mainland.</p>
                        <p>b. The Greeks will not be able to stand down again if the Turks move.</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is putting increasing
                            pressure on the embattled Turk-Cypriots, presumably to produce an act of
                            provocation that will set in train events which can frustrate any
                            settlement you achieve at Geneva.</p>
                        <p>d. The Turk-Cypriots are more than ever in a Gotterdammerung
                            mood—particularly those squeezed between the Greek-Cypriots and the sea
                            on the north coast.</p>
                        <p>5. We are still inclined to send Presidential messages both to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Papandreou. As we now see it
                            the <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> message would be stern
                            but free from indignation.</p>
                        <p>6. We are not persuaded, however, that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers' meeting offers merely “oratory”.
                            Both the Greeks and the Turks have military power today only because
                            they are members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. That military
                            power was not provided for use against one another. By getting into an
                            internecine war they are exposing the Southern <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> flank and <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0294"/>inviting Soviet intervention. This was not the purpose for which
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was designed. That point
                            should be brought home to them. I think it might better be brought home
                            by the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign Ministers solemnly
                            assembled than by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> alone.</p>

                            Minister Papandreou:</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>I have read with interest and appreciation your reply to Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s message.<note n="2" xml:id="d126fn2">See <ref target="#d126fn3">footnote 3</ref>,
                                Document <ref target="#d121">121</ref>.</note> Your readiness to
                            look to the future and your sense of urgency about a negotiated solution
                            are highly valued here.</p>
                        <p>I am sure you agree that nothing must interfere with the urgent business
                            of achieving an agreement between Greece and Turkey. Yet today peace on
                            Cyprus is precarious. Events could take the matter out of the hands of
                            diplomacy at any moment. We know you are exercising your maximum
                            influence and power on the Greek Cypriots in order to insure that they
                            not provoke incidents in the days ahead. You and I both understand that
                            if the Greek Cypriots renew their attacks or continue their present
                            heavy pressure against the minority community, Turk Cypriots will call
                            for assistance from Turkey and the situation might then become quite
                            unmanageable.</p>
                        <p>I have followed with the keenest interest the discussions that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean Acheson</persName> has been
                            having in Geneva. No other question has taken so much of my own personal
                            time and attention. I am pleased at the progress <pb n="257" xml:id="pg_257" facs="0295"/>made on questions relating to the
                            position of the minority community and on the principle of a Turkish
                            base. The major remaining point appears to be the location and extent of
                            the territory allocated for Turkish security arrangements.</p>
                        <p>I fully endorse Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s
                            conclusion that the Karpas Peninsula has a special logic in that it
                            protects the approaches to Iskenderun. In my view this consideration
                            overrides the difficulty that some Greek Cypriots in that area might not
                            wish to reside on a Turkish base even under a lease arrangement. In any
                            case this should not be an insuperable problem particularly since the
                            numbers affected would be small. I urge you to empower your
                            representatives at Geneva to concentrate seriously on the Karpas
                            location in this critical phase of the negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Let me say to you quite frankly that the United States is distressed to
                            find it necessary to inject itself into the Cyprus problem. The three
                            guarantor powers are all <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies,
                            with responsible governments that should be able to find a solution
                            without our taking a part. We are involved, however, because of our
                            concern for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and our friendship for
                            Greece and Turkey whose own relations have become so fragile.</p>
                        <p>I do not know what the next days may bring forth in this tragic
                            situation. But I urge upon you and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that war between Greece and Turkey must never be
                            allowed to occur. Both of you have an utterly fundamental obligation to
                            seek the counsel of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> at the Foreign
                            Ministers level before you become involved with each other in conflict.
                            When France and Germany both became <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners, they put behind them a long history of
                            conflict. Greece and Turkey have the same obligations.</p>
                        <p>The primary purpose of this message is to ask two things of you.</p>
                        <p>The first is to urge you to come to an agreement with Turkey on the basis
                            of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s suggestions.
                            We must never suppose that the job of diplomacy is finished until an
                            agreement is reached. An agreement between Greece and Turkey will not
                            only avert a war between two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            allies but will also provide an opportunity for the Greek and Cypriot
                            peoples to combine their talents and energies to the greater good of
                            Hellenism.</p>
                        <p>The second is that you continue to exert all your power and influence
                            with the Greek Cypriots to maintain peace on the island. This includes
                            securing their fullest cooperation with the United Nations and its
                            forces as well as the lifting of blockades and obstructions that impair
                            the ability of Turkish Cypriots to meet their daily requirements for
                            food and other necessities.</p>
                        <p>Please be assured that I fully understand that you have very difficult
                            political problems in your own country where feelings are at so high a
                            pitch. I also understand your difficulties with Archbishop Makarios and
                            other Greek Cypriots. But I am convinced that an agreement between <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0296"/>you and Turkey is possible,
                            that such an agreement could result in a definitive solution of the
                            Cyprus problem and that this could be accomplished in such a way as to
                            strengthen your <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ties rather than
                            destroy them.</p>
                        <p>You may be assured that I am making representations in other capitals and
                            at the United Nations consistent with what I am now saying to you.</p>
                        <p>With personal good wishes</p>
                        <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>. In reflecting on
                            our recent spate of communications, I wonder if you would agree that the
                            scenario now looks like this:</p>
                        <p>1. Presidential letters as amended are going to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and Papandreou today.<note n="2" xml:id="d127fn2">See <ref target="#d126">Document 126</ref> and
                                footnote <ref target="#d127fn1">1</ref> thereto.</note> Papandreou
                            letter should be at hand for review of situation in which <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> is presumably engaged in
                            Athens.</p>
                        <p>2. Hopefully <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will try to crank up
                            Guarantor Powers' action to prevent Cypriot military involvement with
                            Soviet Union.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> to resume
                            negotiations with Greeks as soon as <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> returns—hopefully Monday or Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>4. If after <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> returns
                            negotiations still look on brink of failure, we would advise Papandreou
                            and Inonu that we regard <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Foreign
                            Ministers' meeting as urgent next step.</p>

                        <p>5. Depending on response of Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, we would call Foreign Ministers' meeting at which
                            we would make the points outlined in your teletype; namely,</p>
                        <p>(a) demand no US equipment used by either side.</p>
                        <p>(b) point regarding Section 5 NAT.</p>
                        <p>(c) advance concurrence by other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            members that Greece and Turkey should delegate you to arbitrate
                            remaining unagreed elements of settlement.</p>
                        <p>6. We would seek <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> support for
                            Guarantor Powers démarche to Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>7. We wish to give further thought to emphasis on London-Zurich treaties
                            before deciding whether they should be raised in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.<note n="3" xml:id="d127fn3">The

                            with <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> early this afternoon and went
                            over Turkish position carefully with them to make sure it was correctly
                                understood.<note n="2" xml:id="d128fn2">

                                morning talks with the Turks in telegram 388 from Geneva, August 16.
                                (Ibid.)</note> (Mediator has told us last night that they seemed to
                            have impression Turks had greatly hardened their attitude and were again
                            insisting on full scale partition as basis discussion.) I made clear
                            that Turks were perfectly willing to talk on basis of my proposals and
                            that their partition was merely tactical counter to Greek proposals
                            which Turks considered complete <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0298"/>departure from line I had been taking and completely unacceptable.
                            Greeks said they fully understood this. I then told them Erim this
                            morning had indicated willingness to discuss long term lease of Karpas
                            Peninsula instead of cession of sovereignty, proposed [<hi rend="italic">provided</hi>] concessions were made on Greek side in regard to
                            area covered. Explained that Turks were insisting on substantial area—at
                            least entire Peninsula—plus absolute freedom to do what they wanted on
                            that area without restrictions as to kind or number of troops or uses to
                            which base might be put. Yesterday, I said, they had insisted they must
                            also have full sovereignty, but today they had moved somewhat away from
                            this.</p>
                        <p>I urged upon Greeks importance of giving this Turkish position serious
                            consideration and trying to come up with something that would meet it.
                            Repeated points previously made about Turkish views on essentiality of
                            quid pro quo for every change made in existing treaties and again
                            reiterated need to accept as reality Turkish feelings about prestige and
                            national honor. Greeks made usual reply about how difficult it would be
                            to cede area of size Turks were demanding and how useless this was from
                            military point of view. We went around this circle a couple of times.
                            Sossides suggested it might be useful to get impartial committee of
                            military experts, or <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> himself,
                            to arbitrate as to what area was really needed from <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military point of view. I objected
                            that Turks had political problem to consider as well as military and
                            probably would not accept outside military arbitration. Also expressed
                            doubt <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> would be willing
                            undertake this duty. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName>
                            conceded that there was something in what I said and suggested that
                            perhaps we could use military judgment only as starting point and then
                            add on something to meet political problem. For example, he said, if
                                <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> ruled that 25 square
                            kilometers was enough, I could multiply this by 5 to take care of
                            political factor.</p>
                        <p>My reply was that I thought we would do better to concentrate on what was
                            needed to reach agreement and then bring in outside elements, such as
                            military experts to dress up terms of settlement and give them
                            rationale.</p>
                        <p>I told Greeks Washington was greatly disturbed by developments and would
                            be making representation in Athens for great efforts to reach agreement
                            and keep situation on Cyprus from blowing up. Emphasized again and again
                            importance of keeping things quiet and keeping talks going by making
                            some significant response to Turkish proposals, which were essentially
                            mine. Both <persName corresp="#p_NND1">Nikolareisis</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> displayed serious
                            doubt that GOG would consider anything like so large an area as Karpas
                            Peninsula, but I got impression they might be somewhat impressed by my
                            presentation and that Sossides was at least disposed to explore in
                            Athens possibility of moving in that direction.</p>

                        <p>To my suggestion that since Mediator was no longer going to Athens
                                today,<note n="3" xml:id="d128fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> suffered a stroke on

                                August 16, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                                assessed the impact of the loss of the U.N. Mediator. (Ibid.)

                                Plaza to succeed him as U.N. Mediator on Cyprus on September 16. He
                                also announced that Carlos Alfredo Bernardes would replace <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza Lasso</persName> as Special

                                September 25.</note> it might be well for him (<persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName>) to stay on longer here, he
                            replied that he thought it more necessary he should go back to Athens
                            and give clear picture present state of affairs. We finally agreed this
                            probably would be best course but urged that he come back as soon as
                            possible, preferably by Tuesday. He planned to take 3:15 flight out of
                            Geneva this afternoon and presumably he is on his way.</p>
                        <p>We had some discussion about effect of Mediator's illness on our talks
                            here. Greeks were noncommittal, but at least did not say that <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName>'s disappearance from scene
                            would necessarily require discontinuance.</p>
                        <p>In connection with problem of preventing trouble in Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> said there were two
                            prerequisites from <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> point of view:
                            (a) Turkish bombing and overflights must cease; and (b) expulsion of
                            Greeks from Istanbul must be halted. We pointed out overflights had in
                            fact ceased and said we were working on Turks about expulsions and
                            likewise urging them to keep Turkish-Cypriots quiet. Told them we had
                            reason to believe from authoritative source that recent Soysal statement
                            that all Greeks would be expelled from Istanbul after September 15th was
                            unauthorized and did not represent policy of <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>.</p>

                        <p>To accomplish this, my plan begins by assuring the Turks that we start
                            from the joint premises that revision of existing treaties requires
                            consent of the signatories and not merely a mob vote in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> (the Turks set great store by this),
                            and that revision by agreement is desirable, a view with which the Turks
                            also agree.</p>
                        <p>The second idea is to relax the tension in Cyprus, restore for the
                            benefit of Turkish Cypriots order and the necessities of life, and
                            subject <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to a restraint
                            which may end in his removal, by entrusting the task to the GOG, which
                            can be held responsible. In return for this <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is offered a prize which it greatly desires—i.e.,
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> undertaking (which dilutes
                            U.S. part in it) to restrain the Turks from intervening as long as the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> maintains, or does the best
                            anyone can to maintain, order and minimum just treatment of all in
                            Cyprus. This plan offers the best chance of accomplishing the result
                            sought and permits the Turks to accept Greek action on behalf of all
                            guarantors as an acknowledgement of the validity of the Treaty of
                            Guarantee. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s cover for the
                            protection of Greek troops on this mission can be subsumed under Article
                            6 of NAT without unseemly stretching. Hence everyone gets something but
                            has to pay for it and is threatened by trouble if assigned
                            responsibility is refused or interference with others contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The proposal to make the Greeks responsible for preventing interference
                            with the supply and rotation of the Turkish contingent is to end this
                            unnecessary provocation and humiliation of Turkey by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' flaunting of his
                            denunciation of the treaties. It also puts pressure on the Greeks to
                            accept their role as peacekeeper since, if they do not and Turks are
                            fired upon when performing a treaty function in no way connected with
                            intervention, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will have
                            fired the first shot and even the Russians will be hard pressed to find
                            aggression in the Turks forcing the relief of their authorized
                            contingent.</p>
                        <p>All these proposals are studded with deferential salaams to the U.N. so
                            that <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>

                            which they should regard as a gift from Heaven.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> as arbitrator is your
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>The gloss on the President's warning not to use <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arms for unauthorized <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> purposes is to permit their use for authorized
                            purposes on Cyprus. It also introduces a new reason for Sixth Fleet
                            interposition, if desired, against improper intervention—i.e., blockade
                            to permit search and seizure of unauthorized <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> weapons upon <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            rather than purely American orders.</p>

                        <p>The last idea is merely to make things even. While bad boys will be
                            prevented from fighting one another, good boys will be protected from
                            attack or threat of force from USSR.</p>

                                uncompromising opposition to any solution arising from the Geneva
                                talks. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 CYP)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> repeated commitments
                            made to <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> and said that this
                            morning's meeting with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reps would
                            finalize arrangements. When I asked specifically whether kerosene would
                            be provided today so Turks could bake bread he replied matter would be
                            discussed and decided on today. In afterthought (which we have conveyed
                            to <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>) he said couldn't see
                            why Turks should have kerosene while Greeks can't have land registry
                            records or parcels in central post office (both in Turk quarter). I
                            suggested it not only unfair equate these matters, but outside world
                            would not understand actions preventing baking of bread as means forcing
                            release <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0302"/>of documents and mail.
                            Surely the women, children and old folk should not suffer nor appear in
                            eyes of world to be made to suffer in this fashion for decisions taken
                            by their leaders.</p>
                        <p>Only new factor re Ktima water supply is assertion by President that when
                            Greeks offered cancel all bills due if Turks agreed pay from now on,
                            they refused (presumably on basis Constitution splits municipalities and
                            therefore payments Turks can only be to own municipal authorities. It is
                            for this reason they have refused to pay Greeks since 1960 Constitution
                            went into effect).</p>
                        <p>I said we sincerely hoped GOC could make some immediate gesture which
                            would give better press and also reduce tensions in Turk community and
                            in Ankara. Said I hoped he was gauging very carefully how much economic
                            pressure Turk Cypriots could take without explosion which could bring
                            additional catastrophes to island.</p>
                        <p>With regard Geneva talks President had little to add to what other he
                            told <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> as reported <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 328. He did emphasize however
                            that “Papandreou will accept anything I agree to but I don't necessarily
                            accept any decision he may make.” He added he felt State Department had
                            got cart before horse in Geneva tactics and expressed continued
                            resentment at being left out of discussions. I said he must realize we
                            appreciated fact solution would have to be acceptable Greek Cypriots as
                            well as others but that we also believed it necessary pave way by
                            assisting Mediator in finding agreement between Greece and Turkey. No
                            solution, whether saleable to Govt of Cyprus or not would work if other
                            two disagreed. He was not convinced.</p>
                        <p>Meeting 11:30 this morning will show whether we are justified in limited
                            optimism engendered by apparent changes which Archbishop has told
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> (and me and Bishop) he
                            will put into effect re freedom of movement and food and fuel

                            have lost whatever sureness of footing they had. Papandreou's suggestion
                            Sunday night of a Presidential declaration and his proposal last night
                            for instant enosis with details to be worked out later had certainly not
                            been thought through. He gave the impression casting about for some way
                            out of his dilemma. He seems at the end of his tether (partly through
                            his own fault) and he sees the US as his only hope. Although the Soviets
                            had moved onto the scene when we met on Sunday, his main preoccupation
                            then seemed to be his fear of another Turkish attack and the consequent
                            involvement of Greece in a war with Turkey. Last night the Turkish
                            threat seemed to preoccupy him less. He then had in mind <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s instructions to go to

                                the Greek Government on August 17.</note> These instructions caused
                            him to see Greece losing Cyprus to Soviet influence and the consequent
                            failure of his own policies. He translated this failure into personal
                            political defeat at the hands of the Communists who would be the only
                            ones to gain by it.</p>
                        <p>2. Papandreou's reaction to the events of the last ten days has shown,
                            not surprisingly, considerable emotion and some inconsistency. For
                            example, while he was allegedly threatening <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> with a parting of the ways in the event of a
                            Soviet alliance, and was also in effect asking US and the Turks to
                            accept his pledge of good faith in giving the Turks a fair deal in the
                            event of enosis, he was at same time withdrawing the Greek elements from
                            Sixth ATAF and <gloss target="#t_LANDSOUTHEAST1">LANDSOUTHEAST</gloss>
                            and presiding over a meeting of the Supreme Council of National Defense
                            which decided to disengage, as necessary, military, naval and air units
                            of the Greek forces now assigned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. (Greek statement on this makes clear this was direct
                            reaction to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> withdrawal air defense
                                units.)<note n="5" xml:id="d131fn5">The Turkish withdrawal took
                                place on August 17.</note> We<pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0304"/> consider these Greek gestures unfortunate and untimely but not
                            reversible until the general climate here improves.</p>
                        <p>Basic fact which recent events have driven home is that there can be no
                            solution of the Cyprus problem which does not take into consideration
                            will and emotions of Cypriot people. They cannot be by-passed or forced
                            into line, and the Turkish air strikes are going to make it especially
                            difficult to obtain agreement from the Cypriot people (regardless of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>) to any Turkish
                            base on the island. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that we should
                            make every effort to keep talks going in Geneva. Even though Mediator's
                            illness has greatly complicated situation, as of the moment it appears
                            that Greeks are still willing to try to narrow the gap separating them
                            and Turks.</p>
                        <p>4. However, it is unhappy fact of life that Papandreou government is
                            fundamentally weak, poorly organized for effective action, and short on
                            talent. Papandreou himself by nature is long on words and short on
                            deeds. It may be, in the end, because of this weakness and because of
                            difficulties faced in obtaining any kind of Cypriot acquiescence, the US
                            will have to accept the unhappy burden of being the guarantor of an
                            “instant enosis” solution that leaves <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> final agreement to
                            be hammered out at a later time. This might turn out to be the only way
                            to forestall a Soviet intrusion on the island. This unpalatable position
                            for the US, leaving us the target of the ill will of all the parties,
                            should be adopted only in extremis.</p>

                        <p>Whether or not the Soviets are serious, the Cypriots, Greeks, and Turks
                            all seem to think so. The mood on the island has become violently
                            anti-US and pro-Soviet, which makes the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> plan all the harder to achieve by agreement.
                            Makarios may be playing with fire, but once again he has moved faster
                            than Athens—or ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The one saving grace may be that Moscow's move is scaring Greece and
                            Turkey into seeing reason. They may at last find a common interest in
                            preventing Makarios and Moscow from coming out on top. But speed seems
                            imperative if we are to push through a settlement by fiat before the
                            Makarios-Moscow axis is firmed up.</p>
                        <p>I. <hi rend="italic">State seems to favor one more try at Geneva,</hi> in
                            hopes that Athens and Ankara may at last stop haggling and strike a
                            bargain. In fact, their positions are not too far apart. The gut issue
                            is how large a base the Turks get and whether it should be sovereign or
                            on a long term lease. It's not clear that we have yet said everything we
                            should to press Greeks and Turks once more, and we'll push this with
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Should this fail, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> are thinking of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> pressure play to force a solution.</hi> In essence
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> himself would
                            split the remaining difference between Greeks and Turks. We would then
                            ask all the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers to join us in:
                            (a) telling Greeks and Turks to buy; (b) calling on Greece on behalf of
                            Guarantor Powers to restrain <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>; and (c) if this fails to maintain order,
                            declaring that whatever violence may occur just be confined to the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>To latter end, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would declare that:
                            (a) No <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-supplied arms could be used
                            by Greece and Turkey against each other—if so, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> will take measures to take back the arms and penalize
                            the offender by denying him any more military aid; (b) the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers would act under Article V to
                            prevent Turk action against Greece or vice versa; and (c) if the Soviets
                            intervened, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would move. This
                            complex and ingenious plan raises several key questions:</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Granted that a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                umbrella is desirable, can we get enough members to play?</hi> Only
                            a majority is technically needed, but if the Scandinavians or Low
                            Countries balked, it would look thin. Would <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> cause trouble? Would many insist on full
                            explanation of the “<persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            award” or offer amendments?</p>
                        <p>B. <hi rend="italic">What are the consequences of taking the play away
                                from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and giving it to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>?</hi>
                            <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> might be privately relieved,
                            but can he publicly acquiesce? What about the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolutions?</p>
                        <p>C. <hi rend="italic">Do we want in effect to put the Sixth Fleet between
                                Greeks and Turks if they seem to be going for each other?</hi> This
                            is what is called for, since we have the only power in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="italic">Could Greece really enforce the terms on the
                                Cypriots?</hi> If <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            smells a rat he'll appeal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            to Moscow.</p>
                        <p>III. An alternative to bringing in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            is Papandreou's scheme for <hi rend="italic">instant enosis</hi>. He
                            pleads that the only way to short-circuit the burgeoning<pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0306"/> Nicosia/Moscow axis is to impose
                            enosis now. Then the Greeks would make a deal with the Turks. We feel
                            the Turks would never buy unless the terms are worked out beforehand.
                            But if they can be, Papandreou's plan may be simpler and more direct
                            than the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> scheme—or perhaps the two
                            can be combined so as to reinforce each other. If Greeks and Turks
                            turned to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (knowing already what
                            they'd get) we'd be home.</p>
                        <p>IV. The ultimate question is whether a Greek-Turk deal, assuming we could
                            get one, can be imposed on the island. The evidence is quite
                            inconclusive. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has
                            outmaneuvered the Greeks every time so far, and now he thinks he has
                            Soviet backing. I think you will want to press George on this; the rest
                            of us have not made much progress.</p>
                        <p>Finally, whatever road we take, we have all the ingredients of major
                            crisis shortly. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will
                            try every trick he has, and the Soviets are now committed to make at
                            least some trouble. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> must still carry
                            the main load, but I think you'll want at least a daily report.</p>
                        <p>This is a brief summary, and I think it gives you what you need for
                            tomorrow, but if you have time, the relevant cables are attached.<note n="3" xml:id="d132fn3">Not attached. A handwritten note on the

                            us here to contain fatal flaw that Turks will not stand still for it or
                                <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0307"/>after it unless they have
                            prior assurance from someone they trust that it will be quickly followed
                            by settlement meeting their essential demands. What <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> proposes to offer Turkey falls
                            far short of this and so does what Papandreou has indicated he is
                            willing to do up to now, although he has been distinctly more
                            forthcoming than <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we have clear impression from <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> and Sunalp, with whom we had discussion this
                            afternoon, that Turks do not trust either Papandreou or <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d133fn3">In
                                telegram 426 from Geneva, August 19, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> reported that <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> had made clear his government's preference for
                                dealing with other Greek political leaders. (Ibid.)</note> They
                            regard Papandreou as deplorably weak and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> as bitterly anti-Turk.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I think that coup d'etat in Cyprus at present time would
                            appear to Turks as clear double-cross and that they would be most likely
                            to blame us for putting up smoke screen of Geneva talks and leading them
                            down the darkened path. Whether they would or would not, I should be
                            extremely surprised if their response to coup were not immediate
                            invasion with all consequences that that would have.</p>
                        <p>We may not be able to stop <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>, but I think it would be unwise for us to connive
                            with him unless he is willing to go whole way in granting rights to
                            Turks. We should be able to deter Papandreou for present, and I think we
                            ought to try to keep him on the Geneva path.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>My Dear Prime Minister:</p>
                        <p>May I begin this letter by expressing deepest appreciation of the help
                            you have given to our work here in Geneva by your own constant attention
                            and thought and by permitting Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> to join in our efforts.</p>
                        <p>Today the President has informed me of the urgency which he believes
                            imminent Soviet involvement in the Cyprus problem has imparted to our
                            work, and because of it has asked me to let you know our joint view that
                            only a little while is left in which a settlement can be made and to
                            give you my own views, which he has endorsed, of the general nature of
                            the settlement which seems to me possible and fair. I know from our
                            conversations with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName>
                            that you are impressed as we are here of the danger, which the Russian
                            moves have intensified, that Cyprus will fall under Communist influence
                            and of the far-reaching effects which this will have upon the political
                            and power situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. I am sure we agree
                            that the danger gives Turkey and Greece a common interest far
                            transcending the exact lines on a map to be drawn in reaching an
                            agreement. The problems presented to both sides in reaching a settlement
                            are political and it is from that point of view that I approach
                            them.</p>
                        <p>I am prepared to apply the utmost pressure and persuasion to get the
                            Turks to give up any claim for sovereign territory on Cyprus, to reduce
                            the dimensions of their requirements for a military base on the Karpas
                            Peninsula and to settle the rights of minorities along the lines which I
                            have discussed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName>
                            and which I can translate into a draft to be available tomorrow.
                            Specifically, I would urge the Turks to limit their plan to a lease for
                            50 years for that part of the Karpas Peninsula running from its
                            northeasterly end to a line drawn north and south just west of Komi
                            Kebir. I am persuaded from the study which I have made of the situation
                            with the aid of military advisers that there is a sound military
                            justification for such a base in the defense of the approaches to the
                            Turkish mainland and in the defense of the base itself from surprise
                            attack. It is quite possible that to draw the western line of this area
                            as I have suggested would present a political problem to you at this
                            time. This problem could be avoided by leaving the line undrawn, to be
                            supplied after military study by the Supreme Allied Commander for
                            Europe, with the assurance by the Government of Greece that if the line
                            should be drawn as indicated it would be accepted. Indeed, the
                            willingness of the Government of Greece to enter into such a settlement
                            might be indicated to me without entering into any present direct
                            commitment to the Government of Turkey. With this assurance I would do
                            my best, and believe I could succeed, in obtaining the agreement of the
                            Government of Turkey not to intervene to prevent or to demand prior
                            intergovernmental <pb n="271" xml:id="pg_271" facs="0309"/>agreement
                            before the achievement of enosis between Greece and Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Without something of this sort the Turks would surely believe themselves
                            to be faced with having their treaty rights almost contemptuously
                            destroyed and themselves faced with the alternatives of unconditional
                            enosis or unconditional independence for a Cyprus under Communist
                            domination.</p>
                        <p>What I have suggested will present the gravest difficulties for the
                            leaders of both Greece and Turkey and for the peoples they lead. But I
                            am confident that, in the face of imminent common peril, each nation can
                            find unity at home in support of solutions which look beyond momentary
                            controversy to the fundamental security and welfare of great Hellenic
                            and Turkish states and support abroad by the grand alliance of free
                            states against interference with their execution.</p>
                        <p>May I request, my dear Prime Minister, the early return to Geneva of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> to help us to this
                            solution.</p>

                                <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note> In making your
                            approach please have these points in mind:</p>
                        <p>1. If we cannot put this deal over right now the chances of success at a
                            later date are slight. The interjection of the Soviet Union into this
                            already tangled web of affairs will make the task almost hopeless.</p>
                        <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0310"/>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s solution is not a
                            bargaining position. It is his decision that this is the minimum that
                            can be given to the Turks without an explosion in Turkey which would
                            have disastrous consequences for everyone. You must make this point
                            sufficiently emphatic in order to overcome the mercantile instincts of
                            your clients.</p>
                        <p>3. Time is really of the essence. That means now. We are talking in terms
                            of a deal within 48 hours.</p>
                        <p>4. There are real advantages in a Greek decision today. The presence of
                            Garoufoulias on the Island<note n="3" xml:id="d135fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> visited Cyprus on
                                August 21.</note> should be helpful in making this work. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> has not yet left for Moscow.
                            Any delay will change the picture to everyone's disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>5. It is not for us to tell the Greeks how to bring about instant enosis.
                            You can say to the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that we have
                            deliberately avoided any direct involvement with <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> since we do not wish to
                            interfere in the measures they may deem necessary to achieve the
                            results.</p>
                        <p>6. Obviously this is not a deal Papandreou can carry off by himself. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> and military must also
                            be aboard. Presumably the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>
                            will wish to have the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> in line. A
                            Greek national decision seems to us essential if we are to force this
                            down the throat of the Turks which in any event will be very
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>7. If you find any disposition to further haggling you can tell the
                            Greeks that we are putting this deal up to the Turks at the same time
                            and we do not propose to haggle with them either.</p>
                        <p>8. What we are offering the Greeks after tremendous endeavors on our part
                            is the possibility of avoiding a Communist take-over of the Island.
                            Moreover, it is the opportunity to avoid setting in train a whole series
                            of different events which in combination could result in the extension
                            of Communist power over a very much larger area. This is a major
                            decision directly affecting the future position of Greece itself. You
                            cannot say this too emphatically.</p>
                        <p>9. From the time of Papandreou's visit here the Greeks have continually
                            asked us what solution we propose. We have invested enormous time and
                            effort in reaching this decision. This is it.</p>
                        <p>10. Yours is an epic assignment. We appreciate the difficulties but very
                            large concerns hang on your success.</p>
                        <p>Good luck.</p>

                        <p>362. Have just returned from 10:30 p.m. meeting with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> at which <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> were present on Greek side. <persName corresp="#p_AN1">Anschuetz</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BHD1">Brewster</persName> accompanied me.</p>
                        <p>I opened discussion by recalling <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s urgent request for “instant enosis” and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> assistance; also my reservations that
                            this could be accomplished without prior agreement on Turk demands. I
                            said highest officials <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> including
                            President had concerned themselves with matter for past several days and
                            had confirmed view that would be impossible proceed without prior
                            understanding with GOT. After taking into account various developments
                            in long history of matter, and in view urgent necessity reach immediate
                            solution, Washington officials and <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> had come up with proposal which went long way to
                            meet Greek aspirations. We were by no means sure however that Turks
                            could be persuaded to go along.</p>
                        <p>I then presented Acheson letter to Papandreou which <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> read in English and
                            then translated into Greek. In submitting letter I made unvarnished
                            presentation based inter alia on points <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 327 to Athens,<note n="2" xml:id="d136fn2">
                                <ref target="#d135">Document 135</ref>.</note> emphasizing that this
                            proposed solution not a bargaining position and represents <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s best assessment of what might be made
                            acceptable to Turks. I stressed particularly that a Greek national
                            decision was essential to put solution across and underlined the fact
                            that this solution offered the possibility of avoiding a Communist
                            take-over of island and averting the extension of Communist power over a
                            very much larger area including Greece itself.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> acknowledged danger which
                            Communist control of Cyprus would pose for Greece. After listening to
                            the presentation attentively he explained that he must have a solution
                            which can be rationally explained not only to his own people but also to
                            the people of Cyprus and their “devilish leader <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.” He confirmed offer
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> had made to me
                            two hours earlier that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> prepared
                            lease an area of 99 square miles on Karpas Peninsula. He added that if
                            he had to deal only with Greek public opinion he could possibly have
                            agreed to lease of roughly 200 square miles. However, in his struggle
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> he would be <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0312"/>placed in a very difficult, and
                            probably impossible, position if he granted Turks double the area of the
                            two British bases.</p>
                        <p>I stressed again that the area delineated, which appeared to be not much
                            more than 5 percent of land area of Cyprus, was absolute minimum which
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> considers Turks
                            might be willing to accept. We went over map a number of times showing
                            where Turk demands had originally started and how they had been
                            compressed.</p>
                        <p>At termination meeting Papandreou confirmed <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> would leave for Geneva tomorrow carrying back
                            Papandreou's answer to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> letter. I concluded by earnestly imploring
                            PriMin to give this letter most serious consideration as a final offer
                            inasmuch as it was Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s view, shared by entire <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> including President, that this was best deal which
                            could be obtained for Greece.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Greek side listened most attentively to
                            entire proposal. Presentation I had made earlier in evening to <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> had obviously had salutary
                            effect. There was no detailed discussion of method of public
                            presentation Acheson proposal if accepted, or of procedures in effecting
                            enosis which I made clear we considered responsibility of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. However, when passage in letter re
                            possible future determination of western boundary by <gloss target="#t_SACEUR1">SACEUR</gloss> was reached, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> dryly commented in Greek to
                            Papandreou, “That's the Vaseline.” Although Papandreou made no comment
                            it was apparent that he appreciated that he was confronted by a
                            fundamental decision and that this decision must be made promptly. I
                            believe he would sincerely like to meet <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposal but has not yet resolved in his own
                            mind how he can face <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and Cypriot opinion as well as his own potential supporters such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and Georkadzis.</p>
                        <p>Postscript: I threw everything at him but the glove. Goodnight for

                        <p>335. We have read your 362<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">
                                <ref target="#d136">Document 136</ref>.</note> with considerable
                            dismay here. Despite what I know was a valiant effort on your part, it
                            does not appear to us <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275" facs="0313"/>that
                            Papandreou has understood the urgency of the situation or what great
                            responsibility we are taking in offering him a solution to his otherwise
                            insoluble problems. I believe it essential therefore that you see the
                            King at the earliest possible hour today and make the following
                            points:</p>
                        <p>1. What you are proposing is exactly what he asked [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]—our
                            assurance that we would hold the Turks still if the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would move incisively to bring about
                            instant enosis under terms that would give the Greeks 95 percent of what
                            they want.</p>
                        <p>2. This is not an offer made cavalierly to be treated in a leisurely
                            manner. We are at one minute to midnight. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had better understand this. If the President is to
                            continue to assume the responsibility for trying to keep peace in the
                            Mediterranean and keep the Communists out, the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> must do its part at this decisive moment.</p>
                        <p>We in Washington—including the President—will be profoundly shocked and
                            disappointed if—after all our anguish and exertions—the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> boggles at the leasing of 100 square
                            miles of territory beyond the last Greek offer and thus permits Cyprus
                            to pass under Communist control. (The total area of the Karpas base we
                            are talking about amounts to 204 square miles.)<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">In telegram 366 from Athens, August 21, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> reported that Papandreou
                                was ready to agree to a deal on Cyprus on the basis of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s proposals, but it
                                must include assurances from Turkey that it would cease the
                                deportation of Greek minorities. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, POL 27 CYP)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>4. If Papandreou cannot bite the bullet and act incisively, then the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> must realize that a
                            national decision is required and required immediately.<note n="4" xml:id="d137fn4">In telegram 368 from Athens, August 21, <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> reported that he had met
                                with the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> who promised to
                                attempt to secure support for a Cyprus deal from the <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> leadership. Constantine also noted
                                the importance of Turkish agreement to cease pressures on Greeks in
                                Istanbul and that Greek Cypriots living within a base area would not
                                be forced to relocate. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Up to this point, the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has failed
                            to come up with a single constructive suggestion that takes into account
                            the realities of the situation. What we are offering is a way out of a
                            catastrophic dilemma at little cost to Hellenism, either in territory or
                            national pride. If this offer is not taken immediately, we see no
                            alternative that offers anything but disaster.</p>
                        <p>6. Not only will our plan extricate Greece from great danger at minimal
                            cost, but it will enable Greece at long last to achieve the historic
                            objective of making Cyprus once and for all a part of Greece and making
                            Athens the single capital of Hellenism.</p>
                        <p>7. There is no time for <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> to
                            return to Geneva for further talks with <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. We must have a prompt decision or the whole
                            plan will fall apart. The proposal will leak—as knowledge of our efforts
                            has consistently <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0314"/>leaked from
                            Athens. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will be put on
                            guard. <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> will be poisoned
                            against the plan and his capabilities to achieve it will be undermined.
                            Papandreou will once again find himself impotent.</p>
                        <p>8. We must have an answer today without waiting for <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName>' return to Geneva. The Turks
                            have been alerted and <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            may be on his way to Moscow at any hour. We cannot undertake to get the
                            Turks into line if the Greeks procrastinate. This is the time to decide
                            and to act and we are unlikely to have a second chance.<note n="5" xml:id="d137fn5">In telegram 107 from Geneva to Athens, August 21,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> commented
                                that while he did not believe the moment proper to extract further
                                concessions from the Turks on either minorities or Cypriots living
                                within a base area, he believed that such concessions would be
                                forthcoming after an accord. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. We are puzzled by Papandreou's concern that he will not be able to
                            explain the plan to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.
                            This seems incomprehensible to us since we had not assumed that such an
                            explanation was ever contemplated. Obviously no plan that would possibly
                            be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could ever be
                            acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. We had assumed that the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would take
                            measures to bypass <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            bring about instant enosis through whatever means they felt necessary.
                            This seems to us the only possible way to effect a solution of this
                            problem. If the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> does not understand
                            this, we fail to see how any solution can be effected.</p>

                        <p>445. From <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. Turks came
                            to see me this morning to say they had reported proposal I put to them
                            yesterday and already had “governmental decision” back from Ankara.
                            Essence this answer was that <pb n="277" xml:id="pg_277" facs="0315"/>Turkey had accepted initial proposals I made in Geneva but this was
                            final, not bargaining position. What I had proposed yesterday was
                            radical change involving abandonment of “principle” of sovereign area as
                            well as basic principles of my plan for protection Turkish minority
                            right. This Turkey could not accept.</p>
                        <p>I took strong exception to statement Turkey had accepted initial
                            proposals. Told me they were acceptable “as basis for discussion”. In my
                            view, this meant discussion of all aspects, not merely that Turkey would
                            accept my offer and try to get more. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said there must have been misunderstanding; Turkey
                            would have been willing to discuss certain details, such as exact
                            boundary of sovereign base area, but it was quite unable discuss idea of
                            lease instead of sovereign possession.</p>
                        <p>I urged that Turks refrain from giving me at this time final rejection of
                            latest proposal. They should wait and see what Greece did. It appeared
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> did not like my ideas any better
                            than <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. At least, Turkey might allow
                            Greece to take onus for breakdown of talks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> insisted, however, on going
                            ahead, saying I could “use it or not.” According to Ankara, he said,
                            sovereign base area of adequate size would have been barely acceptable
                            compensation to Turkey for enosis, but leased base could never be
                            adequate counterpart. Turkey must be free on its base to do anything it
                            wished in both civil and military fields. So far as minorities were
                            concerned, my original proposal had been acceptable, but Greek counter
                            proposal (which he implied I had adopted) was completely different. As
                            he had already said, Turkish Government was not prepared to discuss
                            basic changes. Since <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had failed
                            agree to my position, Turkey preferred no settlement at all.</p>
                        <p>He then began once again to talk about federalism, mentioning that USSR
                            had never declared itself as opposed to this solution. Establishment of
                            federal state on Cyprus would preserve Turkey's freedom of action, which
                            would be lost once enosis took place. He went on to emphasize that it
                            was impossible for <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> to sell
                            enosis to Turkish Parliament and people without sovereign base as
                            counterpart.</p>
                        <p>At this point I read him excerpts from latest Ankara press summary which
                            showed newspapers were talking about enosis as possible solution and
                            pointing out dangers of self-determination for Cyprus in light of Soviet
                            Cypriot rapprochement. They were pointing with alarm to danger of Russia
                            achieving a Mediterranean Cuba. Greek press, I said, was taking somewhat
                            similar line. This seemed to indicate to me that both Turkish and Greek
                            opinion had realized we had entered a new phase.</p>
                        <p>As to federalism, I emphatically said this was not presently feasible
                            alternative. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> simply
                            would not accept it and he would have Soviet support.</p>
                        <p>With all the energy I could muster I tried to impress upon <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> that our only chance to save
                            situation is now. This offer gave Turkey a great <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0316"/>deal, even though I admitted it was not
                            what <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would like. There really wasn't
                            all that difference between sovereignty and a lease. What had
                            sovereignty meant in case of Britain and Cyprus? Possession between 1914
                            and 1960, less than the fifty years being offered Turkey. It would be
                            incredible folly for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to turn down
                            this last opportunity. Rejection would be disastrous for Turkey, for
                            U.S., for Greece and for Cyprus. Turks should realize they can't get
                            what they want without fighting. And that would bring down whole house
                            of cards. I strongly hoped Greece and Turkey would not lose sight of
                            their real national interest. They must not allow themselves to be
                            blinded by wretched island of Cyprus to real Slav danger which
                            threatened them both.</p>
                        <p>I summed up by saying that I had done everything I could. I had no more
                            ideas. If my latest proposal were not accepted, I would be finished.
                            Only thing I could do, and what I planned to do, would be to ask Amb.
                            Hare to make final approach in Ankara to urge <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to reconsider. (I said, however, I would not ask him to
                            do this unless I heard that Greeks had accepted.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> and Sunalp listened to this
                            calmly, injecting occasionally repetitious remarks about Turkish
                            inability to give more ground than I had asked them at first. Their only
                            substantive suggestion was that we go back to validity of existing
                            treaties and that U.S. and Turkey make new joint statement that these
                            treaties must be respected. I said we had made our position in support
                            of treaties clear ever since <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            visit to Washington. Restatement in present circumstances would be
                            futile.</p>
                        <p>At one point, <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> remarked that if
                            there should be settlement between Greece and Turkey <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would prefer to have all aspects of
                            agreement made public at same time. We did not follow this up, but I
                            assume he was referring to my earlier suggestion that agreement not be
                            published, at least in full, until after enosis had been
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>We parted amicably, with Sunalp remarking he would probably not see us
                            again because he had received orders to take command of 29th Division at
                            Erzerum. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said nothing about
                            leaving Geneva.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Seems apparent that sovereignty is key issue in Turkish mind.
                            With it, they can pretend to their people that they have achieved form
                            of partition; without it they think this impossible. I got no reaction
                            at all to my repeated warning about dangers of Soviet domination of
                            Cyprus. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> observed very calmly
                            that if this happens “you will have your Cuba and we will have our
                            Cyprus, each ruled by a man with a beard.”</p>

                            regarding impossibility any lasting peaceful solution involving Turkish
                            base on island. From fragmentary info gleaned from various telegrams
                            would appear we have now presented <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            fully approved <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> plan which includes
                            sizeable base on Karpas if not most of peninsula. At same time we are
                            suddenly presented by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> with “instant
                            enosis” as only way Greeks can see out of present virtually impossible
                            situation. At risk of being considered out of step feel I must observe
                            that we are moving into almost hopeless dilemma and we cannot continue
                            even for short period to ride both Geneva and (reluctantly but perhaps
                            with no choice) “instant enosis” horses. Our reasoning is along
                            following lines:</p>
                        <p>1. “Instant enosis” depends upon availability of reliable Greek troops
                            for use in bringing it about and good discipline on part of Greek
                            Cypriot armed elements.</p>
                        <p>2. Sovereign Turkish base not sellable here. Why should Greek Cypriots
                            accept less than they think they will get at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>? And especially now that GOC has or thinks it has full
                            Soviet backing? Greek army can hardly be expected to force base upon
                            Cypriots who likely actively fight against it (Athens 353 to Dept).<note n="2" xml:id="d139fn2">Telegram 353 from Athens, August 20, reported
                                a discussion with the Greeks regarding Turkish base demands and
                                indicated that the Greek Government had not yet taken a decision on
                                the issue. (Ibid.)</note> Even leased base would be categorically
                            refused by majority of Cypriots and certainly by their leadership
                            including <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>. Therefore both crucial
                            elements for imposed solution are lacking.</p>
                        <p>3. Turks believe we think Turkish base rather than <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base can be imposed here if <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> agrees in Geneva. Therefore, it would
                            seem that in Turkish eyes <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be
                            responsible if “instant enosis” did not result in establishment Turkish
                            base.</p>
                        <p>4. Mood here is such that it not inconceivable <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> et al. might go ahead with
                            enosis anyway without our support and of course without any Turkish
                            base. This will surely be terrible fait accompli for Turks to swallow
                            after having held their hand on assumption that US would obtain them
                            sizeable Karpas base.</p>
                        <p>Realize the foregoing obviously presents us with harsh choice. We feel
                            here that possible solution could lie along lines our 345<note n="3" xml:id="d139fn3">See <ref target="#d133fn2">footnote 2, Document

                                In his letter, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                                stressed the need for an immediate agreement on the basis of the

                        <p>To make long story short <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> was
                            obviously well primed and steadfastly insisted no agreement possible
                            which did not provide for larger base area and full sovereignty, with
                            especial emphasis on latter. He agreed however that this should not be
                            considered as final decision but rather as exchange of views which he
                            would report to <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> and I to<pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0319"/> Washington in order obtain

                            unchanged he would submit to government for final decision but he made
                            clear he would not support; to do so would end his political career.
                            Limit to which he could go was original <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposal.</p>
                        <p>It will probably take me several hours to try to patch this rather

                            of cogency, did not give impression of indicating what he really had in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>As contrasted with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s calm,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>'s pressure seemed be
                            running rather high. Said Turks always being asked make concessions;
                            base proposal worthless; as Turk citizen support of proposal would
                            constitute betrayal of his people; better let things go on as they are
                            or even have enosis with no arrangement. Then and possibly with some
                            significance he observed that in any event there now seemed be “light of
                            hope for federation” and, when I asked him genesis of this idea, his
                            first reaction was to say not result of consultation with Russians,
                            which I had not suggested. Mention of same thing by <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> (Geneva's 445 to Dept)<note n="5" xml:id="d140fn5">

                            may not be coincidental.</p>
                        <p>In sum, my talk was longer version of that between <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> yesterday, with sovereignty and
                            area of base given as striking point, but I am not at all sure that this
                            was not used as excuse to get out from under whole thing, which in
                            curious contrast with what appeared be inspired press build-up for
                            something like what we finally proposed.</p>
                        <p>I of course used every gun at my disposal but <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> had obviously entrenched himself well in advance
                            and would give no ground beyond agreeing keep open for another

                            remotely possible proposal, I recommend that we liquidate Geneva and try
                            new policy outlined in following telegram.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">In telegram 462 from Geneva, August 22, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> recommended a policy of

                            I would say in both capitals that last <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposal was final effort to reach agreement and
                            no modification will improve its acceptability. It has now been rejected
                            by both Greece and Turkey and deemed unenforceable on Greek-Cypriots.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> can make no further effort. It
                            therefore considers Geneva talks concluded and will direct <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> return to Washington.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> considers this turn of events
                            most grave for all. It will continue to make every effort to prevent
                            Cyprus from falling into Soviet orbit, but unfortunately it is now clear
                            that this cannot be done by agreement between its two allies most
                            concerned. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will have to keep
                            foremost in mind what is practical and what is in the interest of the
                            entire Western world. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would deeply
                            regret any development which might lead either ally to believe that its
                            interests had not been sufficiently safeguarded but it must be guided by
                            the interest and purposes of the Alliance as a whole. It will continue

                            Greek Government's vacillation and you should make this point quite
                            clear to them. The President has been advised that the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has accepted our proposal and we intend

                            courage or determination on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> we would have to make clear to the world where the

                        <p>We have been considering how to respond to the Greek request for guidance
                            in handling the situation in Cyprus. You should alter or amend the
                            following suggestion as you see fit.</p>
                        <p>With the approval of Papandreou and hopefully of <persName corresp="#p_CKP1">Canellopoulos</persName> also, the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> would send word to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> that he wished to see
                            him. He would then make the following points to General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> preferably speaking in the
                            presence of Papandreou and <persName corresp="#p_CKP1">Canellopoulos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. The Government has fully considered the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> proposal and believes that it should be carried
                            out.</p>
                        <p>2. A quick solution through the American proposal is the only door still
                            open of preventing the Communization of Cyprus without the practical
                            certainty of a Turk attack.</p>
                        <p>3. The Americans have been making a substantial effort to help find a
                            solution. They have assured the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that
                            if enosis is immediately effected through a peaceful bargain with the
                            Turks on the basis of the American proposal they would promptly provide
                            substantial assistance for the rebuilding of Cyprus and the development
                            of its resources.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this last point you may indicate that we would be
                            prepared to undertake an aid program that could result in the reclaiming
                                <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0322"/>of more land for Cyprus
                            than would be included in the proposed Turkish base. How you should
                            formulate that is for you to decide. We are reviewing the situation with
                            the experts this afternoon and will forward you promptly some harder
                            data as to the possibilities of desalination and soil reclamation.</p>
                        <p>What must be gotten across to General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> is that what the American proposal offers is an
                            opportunity for him to fulfill his Dighenis role and thus reclaim Cyprus
                            for Hellenism and save it from Communism to which <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is leading it. He would also
                            secure for the people of Cyprus the chance to make their Island blossom
                            like a rose.<note n="3" xml:id="d142fn3">In telegram 379 from Athens,

                        </p>
                        <p>1. I told <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that statement that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> did not consider itself in
                            position carry out enosis on basis <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposal came as shocking news on top of
                            yesterday's confirmation that he was prepared to accept the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposals in principle and
                            was drafting a letter along those lines. I said new situation confronted
                            us with possible disaster.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> acknowledged above, but
                            appeared greatly distraught and genuinely disturbed over report on
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>' position and
                            atmos-phere in Cyprus. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> added
                            that although it was folly to risk war over question of the size of a
                            base, he was not master over Greek Cypriot community as <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> is over Turk Cypriots. He said he
                            had been most sincere in his statements to me yesterday and day before
                            and that he had and is <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0323"/>acting
                            in good faith; that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            proposal is acceptable to gov as way to avoid war and resolve Cyprus
                            question, but that he is helpless because he could not impose this
                            solution on the island. This was brought forcefully to light by Defense
                            Minister's discussions in Cyprus. He finds himself in a serious impasse
                            and does not know where to turn.</p>
                        <p>3. He and <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> asked
                            several times for US guidance. Would it be desirable for government to
                            state publicly that it accepted concept of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> plan but that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> turned it down? As result of
                            such statement, Greece would, of course, have to withdraw its forces
                            from Cyprus and leave the island to its fate. Both Papandreou and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> questioned that
                            this would be desirable course of action, as it would play more into
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' hands and drive
                            him even closer to Moscow and Nasser. “But what can be done?”</p>
                        <p>4. Papandreou said only way out that he could see was proposal he had
                            made to me on Monday (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>

                            instant enosis with no prior commitments, get rid of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, cut out Soviets, and leave
                            it to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to promise full safeguards

                            their reservations regarding their capacity to make concessions
                            regarding Turkish base. Yesterday morning Papandreou under intense US
                            pressure took policy decision to accept US proposal in principle (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 366)<note n="5" xml:id="d143fn5">See <ref target="#d137fn3">footnote 3, Document 137</ref>.</note>
                            although he continued express misgivings as to his ability to execute
                            program. Today following <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>' return from Cyprus, Papandreou's illusion
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> might have capability to execute
                            program evaporated.</p>
                        <p>It was always the case that the prospective settlement with Cyprus had to
                            be of a nature such that the Greeks could impose it, overcoming whatever
                            resistance exists among the Greek Cypriots to the settlement. As events
                            moved along, under our pressure the Greeks gave more and more ground,
                            hoping that what they were conceding was not beyond their capability to
                            deliver. In their anxiety to obtain settlement based on enosis, they got
                            beyond their capability to deliver.</p>

                            I have reluctantly concluded that Geneva, as originally conceived, has
                            run its course.</p>
                        <p>In order to salvage remaining possibilities, I ask your comments on the
                            following new proposed course of action:</p>
                        <p>1. In Athens <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> would say
                            to the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that it has proved impossible
                            to persuade the Turks to accept anything less than the Karpas Peninsula
                            Base and even that is doubtful on a leasehold basis.</p>
                        <p>2. However, we are not prepared to let conditions drift to the point
                            where Cyprus becomes another Cuba, as will almost certainly be the case
                            if the <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> regime continues
                            in control of an independent GOC.</p>
                        <p>3. We are, therefore, considering saying to the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that they should go forward with their plans to bring
                            about enosis and that we will undertake to see that, if they bring it
                            off with reasonable promptness, neither the Turks nor any outside power
                            will intervene with military force.</p>
                        <p>4. The conditions of this offer are:</p>
                        <p>(a) The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> must undertake, once enosis
                            is concluded, to negotiate promptly and in good faith with the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> regarding the mutual recision of the
                            Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance.</p>
                        <p>(b) In the course of this negotiation, the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> must undertake as a minimum to offer the Turks, in
                            exchange for the abrogation of those treaties, two major
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>(c) The first is the assurance of minority rights to the Turk Cypriot
                            population in the form developed by <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean
                                Acheson</persName>.</p>
                        <p>(d) The second is an undertaking by the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to grant to the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> a
                            50-year lease for a suitable area to be mutually agreed on with the
                            advice of <gloss target="#t_SHAPE1">SHAPE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>5. While the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> may be reluctant to
                            agree now to negotiate these concessions in the absence of a
                            simultaneous Turkish agreement, we can point out to them that without an
                            understanding with the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> a post-enosis
                            Cyprus will face sticky problems. For example, it will be confronted

                        <p>In Ankara we would propose to take the following actions:</p>
                        <p>(1) Hare would say to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> that he
                            regrets that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has not accepted
                            our proposal and that Turkey will probably never be able to obtain as
                            good a deal again.</p>
                        <p>(2) The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, however, is not prepared to
                            let Cyprus become another Cuba.</p>
                        <p>(3) We are advising the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, therefore,
                            that we are encouraging the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to bring
                            about enosis and propose to tell them that we will assure that this is
                            achieved without outside intervention from any quarter.</p>
                        <p>(4) At the same time we are insisting, as a condition of this assurance
                            to the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, that the Greek Government
                            must agree as outlined in paragraph 4 above.</p>
                        <p>The advantage of this course of action from the point of view of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is that it does not require the
                            Turkish Government to agree to anything. It would merely accept notice
                            of our statement that we expect it to stand down on Cyprus and that we
                            propose again to concentrate on the great issues that bind Turkey to the
                            Western Alliance. We should get some sense of the risks involved in
                            giving the Greeks an assurance of Turkish standdown through General
                            Porter's visit to Ankara in the next two or three days. I would like
                            particularly to have Ray <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName>'s
                            comments on this.<note n="5" xml:id="d144fn5">

                                Ankara, August 24, Porter reported that he would make an effort to
                                convince the Turkish General Staff that the Karpas Peninsula was
                                militarily sound for a base. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>In order to share these risks and at the same time give a firmer
                            underpinning to the proposal, we might consider trying to associate the
                            UKG as well as Germany and Italy with our action.</p>
                        <p>If we get an affirmative reply from the Greeks and implicit acquiescence
                            from the Turks, you might wish to stop off in Rome, Bonn and London on
                            your return to the US to try to get them on board.</p>

                            an arrangement along the above lines. This would minimize the
                            possibilities of a sudden sense of alarm resulting <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0326"/>from the conspicuous termination of the

                            most pertinent. For example, he could not imagine granting Turkey base
                            if mistreatment Istanbul Greeks continues. He also emphasized importance
                            not forcing any population movements and continuation of normal traffic
                            in base area. The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> seemed to
                            think smaller base on Karpas might be possible to sell on above

                        <p>3. Papandreou replied he was in death struggle with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and had to make these

                            was no pressure and no agreed solution, adding there was surely no
                            agreement in Geneva.</p>
                        <p>If he (Papandreou) had approval from us of his offer, then he could
                            disagree with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, hence,
                            his statement that there is no agreed solution was accurate. He said he
                            was in complete accord with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is also claiming that he is for enosis
                            following self-determination. Moreover, as long as there is a
                            “spontaneous” Soviet offer to prevent Turkey from attacking Cyprus, he
                            could not condemn <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> for
                            accepting this. I questioned whether the Soviet offer had been
                            spontaneous in response to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' appeals. I also recalled his statement to me
                            of several days ago that, if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should make an alliance with Soviets, there
                            would be parting of ways.</p>
                        <p>4. Papandreou then reviewed briefly events of past weeks, saying Turkey
                            threatened to attack and in fact had attacked the island, at which point
                            allies did not stop it. Neither did Greece help nor could it help. With
                            no one offering guarantees that Turkey would not attack, Papandreou's
                            position was made extremely difficult vis-a-vis <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He affirmed, however, that
                            Greece would not change its foreign policy position, and if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> undertook any commitments to
                            Soviets, he would withdraw Greek forces.</p>
                        <p>5. There was then some talk on what had been achieved at Geneva.
                            According to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SJ1">Sossides</persName> had asserted that <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> (as late as last night) was
                            greatly disappointed at fact Turks “who had originally accepted concept
                            of leased-base had reverted to position of maintaining sovereign base
                            was only solution.” I corrected this misimpression, stating it was
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> who had proposed
                            leased base concept but that according our record, Turks had not as yet
                            budged from their position that they required sovereign base area.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> then spoke of
                            despicable manner in which press on Cyprus and in Athens were attacking
                            Papandreou government <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0329"/>for even
                            considering negotiated base. Papandreou's position on island was
                            completely destroyed because <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was spreading word that Papandreou had betrayed
                            Cypriot cause. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then stated his
                            tactics were to attempt to disarm <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. Papandreou said he was going to talk to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> strongly and insist on following policy
                            lines:</p>
                        <p>a) That there be no tie-ins with the Soviets or commitments made to them.
                            He added he would make clear to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that Greeks could not fight on side of
                            USSR.</p>
                        <p>b) That there be peace on the island and no provocations.</p>
                        <p>c) That common aim would be enosis and not independence.</p>
                        <p>8. Papandreou asked that he be permitted to sum up his policy concerning
                            Cyprus:</p>
                        <p>a) He preferred an agreed solution which would bring peace and lead to
                            enosis and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-fication. That is why
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> participated in Geneva and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> did not.</p>
                        <p>b) Papandreou expected acceptable plan to be found at Geneva but this was
                            not achieved.</p>
                        <p>c) Since bombings of Mansoura an agreement which would satisfy Turkish
                            needs and be acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Cypriot people has become far more
                            difficult to attain.</p>
                        <p>d) Although everyone on island is convinced there would be no base, he,
                            Papandreou, took full responsibility for a base area size of British
                            bases in his letter to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> (further proof that he differs with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>). He added unfortunately
                            there has been no response to his proposal. He has been told that Turks
                            are insisting on sovereignty of whatever base they might obtain and
                            hence agreement impossible. He could not accept sovereign base. If Turks
                            could accept his proposal he would be willing to struggle with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>e) Following “Geneva failure”, he now faces situation without basis of
                            Geneva talks. He would be more than delighted if coup d'etat for
                            unconditional enosis would be achieved in which case <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would be his captive.
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> has been informed
                            of this and although Papandreou had no hopes that this could be
                            accepted, it would be desirable. He was willing to eliminate <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>9. He repeated again that he planned to stress with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that there be no aggressive
                            action on part of GOC and no provocations. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> wishes wash its hands of responsibility in this area.
                            Problem would then go to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. If Turks
                            attack because Geneva has failed, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            will fight on side of Cyprus “but under flag of enosis and not of
                            independence.” As to Soviets, he emphasized he would demand that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> make no
                            commitments.</p>
                        <p>He repeated that if he were to make any commitments, Greek army will
                            leave Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>10. I stressed great importance of Papandreou making clear to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> today that, despite his
                            statement of accord, Greeks would not <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0330"/>put up with further <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> brinksmanship. I specified various areas which
                            must be covered, including cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> on island, cessation of Greek-Cypriot attacks,
                            discontinuance of economic blockades, permission for rotation Turk
                            contingent. Papandreou said these were “details”, but it very nearly got
                            Greece into a war. I noted that frequently it was not general
                            understanding but “details” which caused wars, and added that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was trifling with peace in
                            his tactics. If by a provocation the communities on Cyprus were to fight
                            each other it would be <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            fault, yet because of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s public
                            statements of identity of views, he was permitting <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to determine Greek foreign
                            policy and possibly, to involve Greece in war.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou agreed that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            trifling with peace, but asked what more could he do? He asserted that
                            he could not make public statement against <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> now. I replied that he could at least make it
                            crystal clear to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that
                            he would have to go it alone if he did not conform to Greek wishes.
                            Papandreou said he would make strong statement to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> against provocations.</p>
                        <p>12. Papandreou said he realized what a problem he had with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that he proposed to
                            enhance Greek military forces on island to ensure pacification of island
                            and to do whatever he could to enhance <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> influence on Cypriot press and public opinion. I said
                            that something along these lines made sense to me, but that if he had in
                            mind sending planes to Cyprus, this was something else again. This would
                            not only be provocation to Turks, but would run counter to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution. Papandreou's spontaneous
                            reaction was “you want Greece to control island and yet you don't want
                            airplanes delivered. If <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> does not
                            send them, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will say he
                            will get them other places.”</p>
                        <p>13. Meeting concluded with Prime Minister repeating that he was in death
                            struggle with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that
                            he hoped I would give him time to work things out with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> today and report to
                            Washington after events of this afternoon.</p>
                        <p>14. In parting, I raised question of municipal elections, expressing view
                            that if Athens found itself with an <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>
                            Mayor in a fortnight, this would be very bad for Greek image. Papandreou
                            stated that I could be assured there would be no Communist Mayor of
                            Athens.</p>

                            nothing in <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s statements to
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> or his message to
                            President which warrants any optimism. Having balked at leased base in
                            own name, Turks certainly will treat with contempt proposal that they
                            have <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base instead. Lease of base
                            on Castellorizon will not make any difference. “Full guarantees” for
                            Turkish minority on Cyprus is old story. Although I think Turks would
                            probably settle for my revised minority proposals, they have never
                            flatly said so and in any case sovereignty and size and location of base
                            are key questions.</p>
                        <p>Fact that settlement on basis <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s proposal would be Greek national solution and would

                            from Greek point of view but, I should say, totally irrelevant from

                            much difficulty in accepting these proposals as you are, although it has
                            not, as I understand it, finally rejected them.” As implied by my
                            comments above, I think there is no advantage in holding up delivery of
                            letter (as instructed <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 364 to

                            In fact, there could probably be two bases, one on Karpas Peninsula of

                            and that they would be piloted ostensibly by Cypriots but actually by

                        <p>1. While hesitating further to delay delivery of President's message to

                            I continue to entertain the gravest doubts about the wisdom of his

                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>. The following
                            expansion of reasons set forth in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 424<note n="3" xml:id="d149fn3">Telegram 424 from

                        <p>A. In involving himself in a successful effort to push <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> further than Papandreou had
                            been able on the question of a base, the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>
                            <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0334"/>also involved himself in a
                            delicate constitutional issue. You will appreciate that the govt has
                            seemed reluctant to discuss his proposal with us and may be sitting back
                            to see what results will flow from the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s “meddling.” The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> will be plunged into profound embarrassment
                            vis-à-vis the govt if one of his first real efforts in diplomacy results
                            in his getting a tougher line from the President than the US has so far
                            put to the govt. This will considerably damage the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s prestige (which Papandreou may
                            well wish to do) and make him less willing in the future to try to be
                            helpful.</p>
                        <p>B. The rap on the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s knuckles
                            is exaggerated by the inconsistency between what the President now would
                            be proposing and <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s
                            characterization of his less demanding proposals as “fair” (his letter
                            of August 20)<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">See <ref target="#d134">Document 134</ref>.</note> and as “equitable, realistic and
                            reasonable arrangements” (his letter of August 26).<note n="5" xml:id="d149fn5">The <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> letter of August 26 was transmitted to the
                                Department of State as an attachment to airgram A–166 from Athens,
                                August 29. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27 CYP)</note>
                            Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> has told
                            the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that the Turks have not finally
                            rejected his proposals.</p>
                        <p>C. If it is to be our policy to push the Greeks for concessions beyond
                            those which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> was
                            proposing, this policy, it seems to me, should be put first to the govt
                            rather than the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>.</p>
                        <p>D. I strongly recommend that if the President wants to include the
                            paragraph in question, it be rephrased to read as follows:</p>
                        <p>“After all, that part of the Karpas Peninsula which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposed for a Turkish base
                            is only a little more than 5 percent of the area of Cyprus. This would
                            not appear in any serious way to derogate from the great benefits that
                            would flow to the Greek peoples from the accession of Cyprus to the
                            territory of the Hellenese.” (This re-phrasing eliminates the reference
                            to a larger area than was proposed by <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and the reference to the granting of the area in
                            perpetuity to the Turkish Government.)<note n="6" xml:id="d149fn6">In

                            <hi rend="italic">Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>:</hi> With respect to Cyprus, the Geneva phase
                            of the negotiations is over. Two months have been spent in narrowing the
                            gap between the Greeks and the Turks and defining their differences.
                            There are two reasons for the failure of the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> talks at Geneva:</p>
                        <p>1. The weakness of the Greek Government which was unwilling to move in
                            and take over in Cyprus, and</p>
                        <p>2. The Turks' insistence on having a sovereign base on the island, which
                            in effect, meant partition. The Greeks insisted on leasing an area to
                            the Turks; hence, Enosis.</p>
                        <p>We should not despair of a Greek reply to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s letter<note n="2" xml:id="d150fn2"> King Constantine's September 3 reply to the
                                President's August 28 message stated that Greece could not accept
                                the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposals.

                            which may indicate the Greeks are prepared to give way, thus permitting
                            continuation of bargaining.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General's press
                            conference was not helpful in that he said that the Cyprus Government
                            had to be a party to any deal between Greece and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>There are two timebombs in the situation:</p>
                        <p>1. The rotation of Turkish troops on the island which will take place
                            within the next few days.</p>
                        <p>2. The cessation of the rights of 10,000 Greeks living in Turkey, which
                            will undoubtedly cause trouble.</p>
                        <p>A Tamaya report on Cyprus is impartial and gives a true picture of the
                            situation. It cites the heavy pressure of Greek Cypriots on the Turkish
                            Cypriots.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said (presumably on

                            that:</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> interpreted this
                            as indication Soviets proving somewhat shy in discussion with Cypriots.

                        <p>I endeavored obtain from <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> statement of how <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> sees evolution of Cyprus problem. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> answered it is important
                            that new Mediator be appointed, that conditions for negotiations be
                            restored and that tranquility be maintained on island. This would
                            decrease tension and passion which in turn would enhance capability
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> gain acceptance on Cyprus of
                            solution negotiated with Turks, provided Turks proved reasonable.</p>
                        <p>When pressed as to outlines of possible negotiated solution, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> pointedly referred to an
                            article on Cyprus in August 27 issue of foreign report published by
                            Economist. Without accepting responsibility for formula set forth in
                            this article, he said that solution along these lines (with the
                            exception of the removal of the Patriarchate from Istanbul) could be
                            contemplated by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Plan set forth in Economist foreign report provides for enosis with
                            protection of Turkish minority. Turkey would receive large scale
                            economic development assistance, removal of Patriarchate to Mount Athos
                            or Patmos, establishment of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            possibly on one of present British bases with Turk participation,
                            transfer of Kastellorizon to Turkey and rectification of boundary
                            between Greek and Turkish Thrace so that the railway line from Istanbul
                            to Idirne would fall entirely within Turkish territory. I noted that
                            aside from fact Turks unlikely to accept this proposal, interesting to
                            note implied provisions that US would pick up substantial part of bill
                            for Turkish economic development plan, and that British would provide
                            military base. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            acknowledged I had not failed grasp essential elements this formula.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, in his indefatigable
                            effort assure an appropriate future for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> today noted that Patriarchate of Alexandria
                            likely to become vacant shortly. Although we both appreciated poetic
                            aspect of this solution, neither <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> nor I evidenced any optimism that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would be irresistibly

                        <p>432. While we are continuing to seek a permanent solution of the Cyprus
                            problem we have been giving further study as to how we can:</p>
                        <p>a. prevent deterioration in the relations between Greece and Turkey that
                            may lead to a dangerous explosion;</p>
                        <p>b. create a climate in which we can prosecute a productive search for a
                            permanent settlement; and</p>
                        <p>c. widen the scope of negotiations in order to get the discussion off
                            dead center.</p>
                        <p>The first order of urgency is to bring about the relaxation of tensions
                            on the Island and restore a more stable—if still uneasy—relation between
                            the two communities.</p>
                        <p>The second is to prevent the Turks, Greeks, or Cypriots from setting in
                            train a chain reaction of retaliation and counter-retaliation.</p>
                        <p>With these objectives in mind we are considering the floating of a
                            possible arrangement between the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, aimed at a wide range of
                            Greek-Turkish issues. Each side would explicitly recognize this
                            arrangement as an effort to prepare the conditions in which a final
                            settlement may be possible. Each side would agree to continue to search
                            for such a settlement urgently and in good faith.</p>
                        <p>There would be several advantages to such an arrangement if it could be
                            negotiated. If both sides complied, it could reduce the probability of
                            an explosion. If the arrangement broke down because one side or the
                            other proved unwilling or unable to carry out its share of the
                            commitments, we would at least have isolated responsibility and made it
                            easier to handle a major row in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Assumptions</p>
                        <p>The assumptions upon which we are suggesting the general lines of an
                            arrangement are the following:</p>
                        <p>a. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has sufficient military force
                            under its control on the Island to enable it to assure that the peace is
                            kept—if it has the will to do so. There are in the neighborhood of
                            10,000 Greek troops on the Island and in addition the 30,000 Greek
                            Cypriot National Guard has been placed under the command of Greek
                            officers.</p>
                        <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0339"/>
                        <p>b. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would genuinely like to narrow
                            the engagement of its own military forces in relation to the Cyprus
                            problem. At the same time it would like assurance that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will not intervene capriciously.
                            (Support for this assumption implied in <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>' suggestion to <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName>, reported in Athens 470 [<hi rend="italic">471</hi>] to Department.)<note n="2" xml:id="d152fn2">

                        </p>
                        <p>c. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would like to avoid the
                            creation of a situation in which it feels compelled to intervene with
                            military force. It would, therefore, welcome an arrangement that
                            contributed to the quieting down of the Island and the improvement of
                            the welfare and safety of the Turk-Cypriot population.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Main Lines of Arrangement</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Commitments by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would use its best efforts to
                            assure that the GOC did not interfere with the rights reserved to the

                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would undertake to assist the
                            restoration of more normal conditions on the Island. It would use its
                            best efforts to prevent the GOC from interfering with aid to
                            Turk-Cypriots from outside organizations and agencies. It would assist
                            in the rehabilitation and resettlement of Turk-Cypriot refugees. It
                            would endeavor to end the economic blockade, etc.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would undertake not to provide
                            military support to the GOC against Turkish action, except in case of an
                            unprovoked attack by Turkey.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would undertake to prevent the
                            GOC from seeking or obtaining military equipment or personnel or any
                            other form of military assistance, from any nation not a party to the
                            London-Zurich Agreements.</p>
                        <p>5. The <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would refrain from any acts of
                            discrimination or harassment against Turkish nationals living in Greek
                            territory, including Western Thrace.</p>

                        <p>1. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would extend for at least an

                        <p>2. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would undertake not to
                            exercise its rights of military intervention under Article 4 of the
                            Treaty of Guarantee unless the GOC were acting in such a manner as (a)
                            to deprive the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> of substantial rights
                            accorded it under the London-Zurich arrangements or (b) to endanger the
                            lives or welfare of the Turk-Cypriot population.</p>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would use its best efforts to
                            prevent the Turkish Cypriots from engaging in any provocatory acts.</p>
                        <p>4. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would avoid any provocation
                            against the Government of Greece, including interference with fishing
                            rights, etc.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Method of Procedure</p>
                        <p>Obviously the points included above are merely suggestive of the general
                            scope of an arrangement. Each point would necessarily have to be
                            articulated and expanded through negotiation. Some points might have to
                            be excluded and additional points added.</p>
                        <p>The development of such an arrangement could be approached through
                            several possible ways. We might ask <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> to undertake this through <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> channels since what is contemplated
                            is an arrangement between two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            members. Alternatively we might undertake the negotiation by asking the
                            GOC and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to send representatives to
                            meet with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> in
                            Washington—or possibly Rome. Or we might have Embassy Athens first put
                            the proposition to the GOG and—if that yielded promising results—have
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> follow through in
                            Ankara.</p>
                        <p>In any event we are faced with a tight time schedule since several
                            prospective actions are scheduled for the middle of the month. The
                            termination of the special privileges accorded Greek nationals under the
                            Treaty of Establishment will take place on September 17. The Security
                            Council discussion of the extension of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Peacekeeping Force is scheduled for the second week in
                            September. At the same time the Turkish Government has indicated that it
                            may wish a Security Council review of the economic blockade.</p>
                        <p>Each of these actions may contribute to a deterioration in Greek-Turkish
                            relations. Taken together their cumulative effect could be serious.</p>
                        <p>We would appreciate your prompt reactions to these very preliminary
                            suggestions. We shall look forward to reviewing them with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> upon his return to

                            against any base on Cyprus, he felt he could still hold him to his word

                            whom he branded as an impossible scoundrel. I replied that it seemed to

                            means of controlling him, pointing out that part of trouble resulted
                            from Papandreou's public support of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to such an extent that his government had
                            gradually worked itself into <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' pocket. I said it essential that calm be
                            restored and harassments stopped, going into such points as rotation
                            Turkish contingent, blockade, full support of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> agreed

                            could yet do without increasing Greek forces in Cyprus, and went over

                            with government.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> then reverted to matter
                            of finding a solution, asking what could possibly be done. I said here
                            again that much depended on ability and courage of government to take
                            things in hand. He did not disagree, but reacted as do all Greeks by
                            saying there are definite limits to Greece's ability to persuade
                            Cypriots. He was afraid the USG did not comprehend <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0342"/>this point nor the fact that Turkey had
                            no justification for having separate position on island provided rights
                            of minorities protected. I again went over arguments in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 400<note n="5" xml:id="d153fn5">See <ref target="#d151fn3">footnote 3, Document 151</ref>.</note>
                            (which, incidentally, we have been using for some time in our
                            conversations here but which usually fall on deaf ears), concluding that
                            if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> continued his
                            insistence on no compromises it seemed to me Greece faced a dismal
                            outlook.</p>
                        <p>The conversation was friendly and intimate. At one time the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> asked smilingly whether I wanted
                            him to get rid of Papandreou. In same vein I asked whether he could if
                            he wanted to. He replied he could not do so now.</p>
                        <p>He is deeply and genuinely troubled about Cypriot situation which is also
                            having its serious and alarming repercussions in the country,
                            economically, politically and psychologically. He would like very much
                            to find a way to “trap <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>”
                            but he appears convinced that Turkish threats and air action have served
                            to strengthen <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            position.</p>
                        <p>In my talk with the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>, as with
                            the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, Deputy <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, and with other Greek leaders, I
                            have been following the line that, whereas we are still most interested
                            in helping to find way out, their responsibility for doing so rests
                            largely with the Greek Government. I believe that psychologically this,
                            plus the general deterioration mentioned in preceding paragraph, is
                            beginning to have an effect. However, I have grave doubts that the
                            Greeks will ever be able to change the attitude of the Cypriot people
                            sufficiently to meet the demands of the Turks.</p>

                            take Cyprus problem to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> has led us
                            to explore among ourselves ways and means whereby lid could be kept on

                            rapid drift to left. We still believe that some variety of “instant
                            enosis” before <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> along lines
                            proposed <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 174<note n="4" xml:id="d154fn4">Dated August 5. (Ibid., POL 23–8 CYP)</note> and

                                CYP)</note> would be course of action most in US interest. However
                            if, as it appears from here, Turkish agreement to “instant enosis”
                            cannot be obtained on terms which would assure successful operation, we
                            think that determined effort by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of
                            sort we are proposing could be valid second-best policy. This policy
                            would have as its objectives keeping the peace on island, preventing
                            Communist domination and producing for the post <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> period a more rational and internationally responsible
                            attitude on part of Cyprus leadership. Presumably enosis would still be
                            our ultimate solution to Cyprus problem but none of our proposed lines
                            of action would appear to stand in way of that goal.</p>
                        <p>Keep the peace. Basic assumption upon which whole policy is based is, of
                            course, that Turks do not invade Cyprus during this period. This means
                            that on island provocations to them are held to a minimum. At moment, as
                                <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>'s 589 to Dept<note n="6" xml:id="d154fn6">Dated September 1. (Ibid.)</note> expressed very
                            well, two most inflammatory issues are troop rotation and economic
                            blockade. These show some chance of being alleviated or fuzzed over but
                            there will be other difficulties which will immediately arise. We
                            foresee no basic change prior <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> in
                            present impasse which manifests itself in virtual absence intercommunal
                            area travel, continuing Greek Cypriot pressure aimed at stimulating
                            defection among Turks to end de facto separate entity, lack of all
                            direct official Cypriot Greek/Turk contact and steady deterioration
                            Turkish Cypriot living conditions.</p>
                        <p>On food and living condition for Turks we can see no new or imaginative
                            alternative to unremitting and coordinated pressure on GOC at all levels
                            by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> through Embassy here, UNSYG
                            through his representative on island and other interested governments.
                            All of us are engaged in this now but are seeking ways improve
                            coordination. (Galo Plaza's modest successes in raising blockade
                            indicate that he should be kept on if at all possible.) We would also
                            try direct world press attention more sharply at pressures on Turks. At
                            same time, we would continue (as now in our weekly luncheon meetings
                            with leaders) to try to prevent Turkish Cypriots from creating their own
                            provocations by over-exaggerating their plight.</p>
                        <p>On military side of keeping the peace, believe that continued <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> presence with hopefully wider
                            or at least more discretionary powers <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0344"/>remains important. However, determining factor will be
                            degree of restraint <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can exert
                            through its forces here and through <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>. We have made proposals in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 431 (Notal) for strengthening
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> hand in Cyprus and would hope
                            that these could be pursued actively.</p>
                        <p>Political action in Cyprus. The West still retains certain basic assets
                            in its competition with Communist forces for Cyprus. These are:
                            ideological affinity of Greek Cypriot people with the West growing out
                            of their age-old yearning to return to Mother Greece, a Western country;
                            fear of a Communist take-over on part of business, educated, and
                            professional groups who, while they lack political strength, have some
                            if dwindling influence; presence substantial number Greek troops, loyal,
                            well-disciplined and anti-Communist, Greek Cypriot National Guard as yet
                            not extensively penetrated by Communists; several Ministers and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> who are
                            anti-Communist and oppose <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' policy on this subject. In addition, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has worked with non-Communist
                            nationalist Greek Cypriot organizations in fields of labor, youth,
                            veterans affairs, farmer unions and certain newspapers.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, due sharp anti-US hysteria which prevails in Cyprus today
                            because of what Greek Cypriots believe to be US pro-Turk policy we are
                            precluded from taking full advantage of contacts in anti-Communist
                            forces listed above. There are two possibilities which occur to us to

                            circumstances, namely by privately indicating that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> fully supports concept of enosis with
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base and is working covertly
                            now and will be openly later to bring this about, and</p>

                            (perhaps using Greek Embassy Political Counselor proposed <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 431 Notal).</p>
                        <p>Number one has serious risks in our opinion since it could lead to leaks
                            with bad Turkish reaction thereto and increased pressure for overt

                        <p>Meanwhile as far as possible we would try to establish appearance of

                        <p>The principal subject for discussion at the President's luncheon today
                            was Cyprus. Those present with the President were: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>, Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Dean Acheson</persName>,<note n="2" xml:id="d155fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> returned to the
                                United States on September 4.</note> and myself.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> revealed their agreement on the
                            conviction that the only solution now would be a fait accompli in which
                            the Turks would move to occupy the Karpas peninsula, triggering an
                            instant enosis under Greek leadership, with a consequent supercession of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> in particular emphasized
                            that no negotiated solution was possible because of the weakness of
                            Papandreou and the strength and intractability of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. On the other hand, a program
                            of indefinite delay could only strengthen the hand of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and increase the danger that
                            an eventual Turkish explosion would be both violent and undirected.</p>
                        <p>A number of questions were raised by the President. What would happen to
                            the Turks on the island? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            answered that he would expect most of them to stay and that, with luck,
                            bloodshed would be limited. The President asked whether the Greeks would
                            follow this scenario and whether they could control the Greek Cypriots.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> pointed out that there
                            already exists between Athens and Nicosia agreement to move to instant
                            enosis if the Turks move against the island. They expected that this
                            agreement would probably be carried out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State asked whether <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would appeal to Moscow instead of to Athens.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought he would not,
                            and he said the appeal would not be answered in any serious way. I asked
                            what would trigger the Turkish action, and <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> answered that nearly
                            anything would serve. The most immediate possibility was the refusal of
                            troop rotation.</p>
                        <p>The President summarized by saying that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>'s argument appeared to be
                            that we must expect a resort to action in one way or another, and that
                            the choice was whether it should be messy and destructive or controlled
                            and eventually productive, in accordance with a plan. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> agreed with this definition
                            of the problem. He indicated that in his discussions with a Turkish
                            military leader the Turks had shown that there was a great Turkish
                            interest in such a plan and that the Turks would do their best to
                            execute it with a minimum use of American <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0347"/>weapons and a minimum resort to those kinds of
                            force—like air bombing—which were internationally unpopular.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that it would
                            be impossible to warn the Greeks of any planned Turkish action because
                            of the danger of leaks to Nicosia. He also noted that the British would
                            be troubled about this plan because of the status of Cyprus as a
                            Commonwealth state. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> remarked that this might be true for <persName corresp="#p_BRA1">Butler</persName>, but that Mountbatten would be
                            friendly and that the British bases would be protected under this
                            plan.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his own doubt that the plan as put forward could
                            in fact be neatly and tightly controlled, without risk of escalation. He
                            thought that in particular the Greeks would be very likely to move with
                            all their strength on the island against a Turkish lodgment, and he
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> for a careful
                            Joint Staff study of the problem. The President also noted that the next
                            two months were not a good season for another war, and the question was
                            raised whether it was essential to press along this road before
                                November.<note n="3" xml:id="d155fn3">On September 11 at 10:45 a.m.,

                                discuss the meeting with the President: “Bundy wanted to know if he

                                thought the President wanted to make sure nothing happens. Bundy did
                                not read it this way. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                                did not either. Bundy read it, ‘Don't make something happen out of

                                something does get hot. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                                agreed. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> thought

                        <p>485. During past few days, Turkish political developments appear headed
                            toward two brinks simultaneously: severe attack against <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and pressure for national
                            coalition; and resurfacing xenophobia expressed in desire reorient

                        <p>To dump <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> at this time is
                            serious and could even be dangerous, but to go toward neutralism has
                            even more serious implications. This double trend was almost inevitable

                            Cyprus situation continued degenerate and efforts promote solution
                            failed materialize. Dissatisfaction appears fanning out two directions
                            mentioned above. Interesting note dissatisfaction with Inonu almost

                        <p>535. Saw Erkin late yesterday to give him reading on Washington talks as
                            directed by Under Secretary, i.e. that situation had been given long,
                            hard look; that time not ripe for new American initiative but necessary
                            improve situation on island; that important Turk Cypriot leaders acting
                            in such way as seem to be exploiting their compatriots. In so doing
                            emphasized this not indicative any lessening interest in finding
                            solution but concentration on immediate essentials which could smooth
                            road to longer term objectives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> was not in particularly
                            happy frame of mind, saying he had hoped we would be able come up with
                            something new and definite. Failure <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0353"/>do so will make it necessary for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> take strong measures itself and also
                            leave field open to Soviets who are at this moment actively engaged in
                            negotiations with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. How
                            is it they find it possible be so active and we unable do so? I said for
                            simple reason that acting irresponsibly to cause mischief is always easy
                            whereas acting responsibly for constructive purpose much more difficult.
                            Repeated we not slackening effort; merely focusing attention on
                            immediate objectives. On other aspects of problem <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> commented as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. He was not enthusiastic re initiative of <hi rend="italic">Brosio</hi>
                            but only specific criticism made was with reference to use of PermReps
                            in role of “three wise men” rather than approaching at ministerial
                            level.</p>
                        <p>2. Said he had just dictated reply to <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> who had made plea through Turk Amb in Athens
                            for holding up deportation of Istanbul Greeks and used as argument
                            efforts <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had made to resolve rotation
                            problem. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> had said in reply
                            that he had been able arrange postponement of four weeks but that he at
                            loss understand use of rotation as argument since there had been no
                            result.</p>
                        <p>3. Elaborating on foregoing, <hi rend="italic">Erkin</hi> said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> still seemed be operating on assumption
                            that things going their way and unnecessary to do anything except let
                            matters take their course. I demurred, saying that, although this might
                            have been true sometime back, I was convinced that responsible officials
                            in Athens now quite aware of danger of allowing Greek policy to be
                            determined by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that
                            this had been brought out with especial clarity in connection GOC
                            flirtation with Soviets. It true that this changed attitude has not as
                            yet produced strikingly obvious results but it is in right direction and
                            should be understood. <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            seemed interested but dubious.</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had consented somewhat reluctantly
                            to appointment of Galo Plaza as Mediator but had immediately had reason
                            regret decision when it had been learned that he had submitted report
                            misrepresenting situation of Cypriot Turks which had been shown up in
                            true light by subsequent report of General <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName>.</p>
                        <p>5. There seems to be uncertainty as to when Cyprus question will come up
                            in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. If it goes into Political
                            Committee later discussion likely but could be as soon as late November
                            if it taken up in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> itself as
                            question arising out of general debate.</p>
                        <p>Position of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will be that it still
                            seeks federation but if there is question of enosis <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will insist on double enosis. By same
                            token, if proposal is for self-determination, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will insist on double-self-determination. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will definitely not accept <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> resolution which would result in
                            Greek-style enosis.</p>
                        <pb n="316" xml:id="pg_316" facs="0354"/>
                        <p>In this connection, <hi rend="italic">Erkin</hi> observed only tangible
                            result of Geneva talks was that U.S. and U.K. had promoted cause of
                            enosis without being able obtain recognition of Turkish interests.</p>
                        <p>6. Concluding in same critical vein, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> revived complaint that, whereas <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> not hesitant in initiating discussion
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> in matters of interest to us,
                            process often seems be one-way street because of our failure respond to

                            necessary for him to go to Moscow because he did not wish to give
                            offense to the Soviet Union in light of the fact that they had pressed
                            President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> himself very
                            hard to come to Moscow and he intimated (somewhat slyly) <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0355"/>that he needed to be present to be sure
                            that the Cypriot delegation in Moscow did not get off the track. He said
                            that his purpose in going was to inform the Soviet Union that the
                            ultimate object of Cypriot policy was union with Greece. He then asked
                            me whether I did not think that if the Soviet Union and the United
                            States both agreed to the union of Cyprus and Greece, this would ensure
                            that Turkey would make no military moves.</p>
                        <p>I told him that whether he went to Moscow was his own affair but that I
                            would urge upon him most solemnly that it would be a great mistake for
                            Cyprus to abandon its position of non-alignment and find itself in a
                            military or security arrangement with the Soviet Union. I said, very
                            directly, that should such arrangements be in effect and there were
                            trouble between the Warsaw Pact and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries or between the United States and the Soviet
                            Union, the result would simply be that Cyprus would be crushed. He tried
                            to leave the impression that he expected nothing more than the
                            unilateral declaration made by the Soviet Union in the Security Council
                            yesterday to the effect that if Cyprus was attacked, the Soviet Union
                            would defend Cyprus. I then told him that he could be sure that the
                            Soviet Union would be playing a double or triple game in this situation
                            since their object would be to stimulate difficulties for other people
                            and tension between <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. I
                            pointed out the possibility that the Soviet Union might in fact
                            stimulate Turkey to oppose enosis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> told me that upon his

                                (Ibid.)</note> Made pre-arranged call on <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> this morning for purpose general discussion.</p>
                        <p>As might have been expected he was very upset re recent turn of events
                            affecting questions rotation and Cyprus road, saying he had just talked
                            to <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and was at wit's end know
                            what to do. Feeling in country is very strong and “pressures”
                            (unspecified but presumably military) being exerted on govt. U <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> has turned out be just as bad as
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had been criticized before for using
                            air force but they will do so again if necessary to effect rotation and
                            be prepared “to fight it out”.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> if he could clarify
                            situation as he sees it. Following is distillation of what he had to
                            say:</p>
                        <p>Rotation and opening Kyrenia Road are separate questions and must go
                            ahead with first regardless of second. However, if we happened to be
                            susceptible of simultaneous solution that would cause no problem.</p>
                        <p>As regards Kyrenia Road, both sides are agreed re Nicosia by-pass, Turks
                            also agree that, with exception of Turk contingent and <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> no armed forces would be
                            allowed on road. Turks had agreed remove Turkish police against strong
                            Cypriot Turk objection and Cypriot Turk armed forces would also not be
                            allowed use (since this contrary to what we told yesterday, I managed
                            get this repeated three times in effort avoid misunderstanding).</p>
                        <p>What <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> cannot stomach, however, and
                            what it never agreed to in contacts with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> was that Turk contingent could only use road without
                            arms. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has given assurance that
                            contingent would only use road for normal “requirements of service and
                            liaison”. It has also stated that contingent commander would maintain
                            close contact and cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            commander. What further could reasonably be asked of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>? After all there are limits to
                            concessions and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> cannot take action
                            which would undermine integrity of a duly constituted military unit.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing that contingent is only question as far as road concerned,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> asked that I
                            communicate most urgently with Washington and seek its views with
                            minimum delay since this could be most important in influencing current
                            decision making here.</p>

                        <p>How to reconcile difference between reftel and situation as postulated by

                            since <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> had just gone over
                            with <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, it represents a
                            modification in position following report from Eralp and I believe we
                            should proceed on that assumption, although confusion in this connection
                            has been so great throughout that it is difficult know when on firm
                            ground.</p>
                        <p>Would strongly recommend we take this opportunity flash something back
                            here for communication to <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            by tomorrow morning. This would serve two purposes; firstly, to
                            capitalize on what could be settlement of rotation at time when pressure
                            building up here to go off deep end; secondly, to give concrete evidence
                            of our continuing interest in Cyprus problem at time when, despite full
                            explanation, there is strong feeling here that we have abandoned Turks
                            to their fate. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            made this pretty clear this morning and, although we cannot always
                            pander to psychological reactions, I believe that in this case there is
                            sufficient substance to it to justify recognition, especially since the
                            context in which problem now raised would seem to be potentially
                            constructive and not involve our getting into unduly deep water.<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">Telegram 978 from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss>, October 5, reported that an agreement on control

                        <p>Ankara, of course, is in best position to judge whether there has been
                            any real give in <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s attitude toward
                            Cyprus recently. Although we still awaiting outcome current negotiations
                            on Kyrenia Road this initial step in reducing <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> support of Turkish Cypriots appears to us as possible
                            straw in wind and in line US overall policy and interests.</p>
                        <p>However, it is on <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and pro-enosis
                            Greek Cypriot side where there have been great slippages. While we are
                            marking time there has been a noticeable decline in strength and
                            influence of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and increasing momentum
                            in the drift to the left. We have seen in past two weeks press campaigns
                            which were inconceivable even on part of Communist papers three months
                            ago. These have now reached point of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> inspired attacks on hitherto sacrosanct Grivas
                            himself. Such attacks, of course, have as their real targets Greece and
                            concept of enosis. There are reports of increasing conflicts between
                            Greek officers and National Guard conscripts and good evidence that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is working actively
                            against Greek officers behind the scenes attempting to weaken their

                            Archbishop seems incapable of making political errors, e.g. by skillful
                            maneuvering over past two months he has eroded limits of what could be
                            given <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> for prestige purposes from
                            Turkish sovereign base on island, to Turkish share in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base separate from British sovereign

                            base carved out of British bases, to present rapidly retreating

                            Greek Cypriots regard <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            negotiations with Moscow as complete success and now expect him to
                            continue his victorious march through Cairo to General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile pro-enosis and anti-Communist elements who have usually been
                            found around Grivas are falling apart. Their newspapers are unable to
                            compete with pro-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> media.
                            Their organization is weak and they have no significant political

                            looks like ill-conceived and desperate gesture in sending Papandreou's

                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. As usual in contests of this
                            sort <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has emerged even

                            seems definitely to be running out. Since viewed from here possibility
                            of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> accord on Cyprus looks dim, we do not see much hope of
                            checking <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> except by use
                            of regular Greek troops on island and National Guard units which they
                            control. Moreover because <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is having notable success in isolating Greek
                            military further and further from mass of Greek Cypriots we cannot much
                            longer count on successful action by them. Unless dramatic and decisive
                            steps are taken very soon to reverse the trend, Cyprus will certainly
                            become, after <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, an independent
                            neutralist anti-Western island with a growing Communist element which
                            could thereafter easily turn the island into Mediterranean Cuba.</p>
                        <p>In other channels we are making certain recommendations for actions US

                        <p>I do not believe Andreas Papandreou's statement, particularly regarding
                            possible <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base, reflects current
                            views of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> in general or of
                            Stephanopoulos or Garoufalias in particular. (I do believe, despite

                            that reportage probably reflects rather accurately his own orientation
                            and unfortunately his influence with his father is a factor determining

                            condemnation of Turkish aerial attack and use of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> weapons. Both <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> and Andreas Papandreou have
                            spoken to me in this sense in last few days when I taxed them with
                            Andreas' interview, and I am certain this is one of reasons <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> considers <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will provide more effective forum than <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                            issue.</p>
                        <p>We find no evidence here that anyone is thinking of reexamining <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> proposals and certainly not
                            of improving previous Greek offer. Consensus seems rather to be, as
                            Nicosia has pointed out, that evolution of situation has made it
                            unrealistic to think in these terms and that in many respects,
                            notwithstanding hazards of increasing Soviet influence, situation is
                            evolving in manner generally favorable to Greek and Cypriot
                            aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Sossides in recent conversation told <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss>
                            that if, however, US Government prepared in conjunction with British to

                            utilize its military and political assets on island to precipitate
                            enosis. This would mean US support for solution which could be
                            politically acceptable in Cyprus—a solution which could withstand
                            counterattack from <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.
                            Sossides said under current circumstances this solution would require
                            “unconditional enosis”, protection of Turkish minority, and eventual
                            conversion of British base into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            base with Turkish participation. He estimated that, if this formula were
                            accepted, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could precipitate enosis
                            within a month or two. Sossides <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0363"/>is in touch with Grivas and participated in arranging Delipetros
                            mission to Nicosia which was designed to strengthen <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> capabilities there in the press, radio,
                            and among certain political personalities.</p>
                        <p>In contacts with other Greek officials in recent days, we have had no
                            confirmation of Sossides' statements to <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> regarding present willingness <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to move ahead in event US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> prepared to support a solution providing for
                            “unconditional” enosis and British base converted into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base. Prime Minister and Garoufalias
                            have stated to <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> and me on several
                            occasions in past that if US would support a solution which could be
                            made politically acceptable on the island, Greek armed forces and Grivas
                            would take measures forcibly to remove <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if necessary. We will seek new reading on their
                            views.</p>
                        <p>Evidence seems clear <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> actively seeking
                            extend its control on island a) in order deter Turk intervention which
                            would lead to Greek-Turk war and b) in anticipation that situation might
                            develop in which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> assets could be
                            effectively applied to bring about enosis.</p>
                        <p>As I see it there are two principal contingencies in which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would consider it feasible openly to
                            challenge <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and attempt
                            precipitate enosis: a) Cypriot involvement with bloc to degree which
                            obviously approaches satellization, or b) US prepared support solution
                            which GOG considers can be made politically acceptable on the
                            island.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary showed Mr. Galo Plaza a copy of the Turk-Soviet joint
                                communiqué<note n="2" xml:id="d164fn2">Not found.</note> and noted
                            that the Soviets appear to have gone further in supporting the Turkish
                            position on the inviolability of treaties than we had in the joint
                            communiqué issued after the <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            visit to Washington. The Secretary then noted that Cyprus Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said when here
                            some weeks ago before his Moscow visit that he would tell the Soviets
                            point blank that the Greek-Cypriots want enosis eventually. The
                            Secretary expressed the thought that the Soviet reaction to <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s statement together with the
                            tone of the Turk-Soviet communiqué could be somewhat sobering for the
                            Greek-Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Galo Plaza said that it is important to know what type of enosis is
                            being discussed since <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            definition is quite different from that of the Greeks. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said that he had urged the Greek
                            Government to sit down with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and arrive at an agreed definition. He has the
                            impression that Greece has pressed <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to arrive at such a definition with them, but
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has successfully
                            evaded an answer. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted
                            the former United States assumption that a strong pro-enosis line from
                            Greece would arouse the latent enosis sentiment on the island and
                            undercut <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, but he feels
                            this is no longer possible. Galo Plaza agreed and said he considers
                            Papandreou to be over confident regarding his ability to handle
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He described
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as head and
                            shoulders above any other Greek leader, in effect a “Mr. Cyprus” who was
                            capable of running Greece as well. This was apparent from the beginning,
                            Mr. Galo Plaza said, and had convinced him that he must work through
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and do nothing
                            behind his back. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> told
                            him the day before <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> died
                            that, even if the Geneva talks <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0365"/>brought forth a proposed solution very much along the lines that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> himself wanted, he
                            would still reject it since it was being applied from outside. In line
                            with his determination to work through <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>
                            noted that, as soon as he reached New York after his last round of
                            talks, he wrote the Archbishop a full report; and the Archbishop was
                            very flattered. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said that
                            he made the point with Markarios after the Cairo Non-aligned
                                Conference<note n="3" xml:id="d164fn3">The Conference of Heads of
                                State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Cairo
                                October 5–10.</note> that the Archbishop had to be flexible since
                            the Turk-Cypriots were cornered and he alone had room to maneuver;
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> agreed. Earlier,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> explained, he had had a
                            similar experience with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            in connection with the economic blockade after Kokkina-Mansoura. He told
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that it was not
                            possible to hold a people under siege in the twentieth century, and that
                            he must call the blockade off. The Archbishop then personally wrote his
                            five-point program to ease the economic blockade and offer amnesty to
                            the Turks. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> noted, is always alone and all
                            decisions are made on his own. He now appears more flexible and realized
                            that he has been very lucky to date. He wants to attend the United
                            Nations General Assembly, but indicates that he will check with
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> first before deciding
                            to attend and that he is willing to do whatever <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> recommends is best for the
                            mediation. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> feels that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> wants to be the one
                            to reach a settlement. He also feels, however, that if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had from the beginning
                            exercised the good behavior he has shown in recent weeks, the problem
                            would long since been solved.</p>
                        <p> Galo Plaza explained that his own plans are to return tomorrow, November
                            10, to Nicosia where he will have very concrete talks with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He will then proceed to
                            Ankara, Athens and London before returning to New York in time for the
                            opening of the General Assembly. He had been thinking of making an
                            interim report at that time, but has given up the idea. Now he plans to
                            report orally to the Secretary General in January. The report, he feels,
                            will reflect neither total agreement nor total disagreement among the
                            parties. It will contain his findings and his recommendations for a
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Turkey and the Turk-Cypriots, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> noted that <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> and the Turkish leadership told him very firmly
                            that they must find a way out of the Cyprus problem, but that it must be
                            on honorable grounds. <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>
                            described Turkish objectives to <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> as being, first, an honorable way out, second,
                            Turkish security and, third, the welfare of the Turk-Cypriots, with the
                            latter being much the weakest point as demonstrated by the Government of
                            Turkey commitment on the Kyrenia road without prior consultations with
                            the Turk-Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said
                            that through most of his consultations to date he had done more
                            listening <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0366"/>than talking except
                            in Ankara where the Turks began speaking of separation of the two
                            communities. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said he told
                            the Turks that he was completely opposed to any physical separation of
                            the communities in a federation scheme and that he would not accept
                            partition as a basis for discussion since he considered a Greek-Turkish
                            border through Cyprus, with Greek-Turkish relations dependent on the
                            unpredictable and volatile Cypriots, as completely unrealistic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said he asked <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>, and later the Athens Government,
                            for views on an independent, non-aligned, demilitarized Cyprus. Both the
                            Government of Turkey and Government of Greece said this would leave a
                            weakened Cyprus which would be prey to many outsiders. The Turks,
                            however, said that this would be acceptable from the point of view of
                            their security. In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>'s inquiry, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said that such an arrangement might be similar to
                            the Austrian example and that it could, in fact, be based on an
                            international agreement which would include the Soviets. The Turks, he
                            noted, are definitely against instant enosis which would mean war with
                            Greece. The British asked him why it should not be possible to bring
                            about enosis by a takeover of the island by Grivas and the 10,000 Greek
                            troops there. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> told them
                            there was not a chance of this; <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has all the political power and could defeat
                            any such move. Concerning enosis, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> noted, the United Nations itself could not write
                            off a member state but could certainly accept such an arrangement if the
                            countries concerned joined of their own accord.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if it were far afield to think that the parties might
                            start on the basis of the London/Zurich Agreements and proceed to amend
                            them into something more workable. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> reacted negatively to this. He noted that both
                            sides have now firmly rejected London/Zurich as a basis for the future
                            and that the United Nations is trying to find a new basis for a
                            political settlement; any attempt to return to London/Zurich would start
                            the battle again.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> re-emphasized that the
                            Turks are weak in this dispute and would settle for much less than the
                            goals they first spoke of. They must find an honorable way out, not for
                            the fact of Turkish public opinion, but in order to satisfy the Turkish
                            armed forces.</p>
                        <p> Galo Plaza noted that the Greeks have spoken of giving the Turks one of
                            their small islands near Cyprus for a military base under a 50 year
                            lease. The Greeks have also, he noted, spoken to the British about the
                            possibility of one of the British bases on Cyprus being committed to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and shared with the Turks.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> checked this with the
                            new British Government in London. The British did not reject the idea
                            and, in fact, said that they are willing to go as far as necessary to
                            reach a solution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CH1">Cleveland</persName> asked if Galo Plaza's
                            recommendations might include suggesting several alternative solutions
                            to the Cypriot people in a referendum; he asked specifically if such
                            alternative solutions could <pb n="329" xml:id="pg_329" facs="0367"/>include enosis. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said that
                            it could since it would be the choice of the people and not a proposal
                            by the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if the Turks might agree to participate with Greece
                            in some sort of defense board concept. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> expressed doubt and noted that the Turks and
                            Greeks have forces on the island now which show no evidence whatsoever
                            of cooperation. He expressed the feeling that independence must come as
                            the first step but that first <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and the Greeks must decide what they mean by
                            enosis. Many complications lie ahead even before a firm definition can
                            be reached.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if Galo Plaza advised the United States Government to
                            lie low for the present. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>
                            stated that this was desirable to a point, but that United States was
                            also needed with the Turks. When the Secretary pointed out that we have
                            used much of our capital with the Turks through past intercession,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> expressed understanding
                            but felt that efforts must be made to impress on Ankara the need to be
                            realistic. He noted that they had first told him they must have
                            population separation with the Turkish communities getting 30% of the
                            land to correspond to their percentage of land ownership. Later Ankara
                            dropped this to 20% and still later to a base area with enough space for
                            some Turk-Cypriots in the event of another crisis.</p>
                        <p> Galo Plaza expressed the conviction that, with reference to the Turks,
                            speed is important now because of <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s age. The Turks become nervous, he noted,
                            whenever <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> is ill since there
                            is no one strong enough to make decisions if he goes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that, if Turkey is trying to find a way out of the
                            Cyprus dispute, it may find it earlier without any United States
                            involvement. <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> could be
                            undermined if he appeared again to be responding to United States
                            pressure. Furthermore, such pressure could cause an adverse reaction in
                            the Turkish military.</p>
                        <p> Galo Plaza referred then to Geneva and said that the <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> effort created the
                            impression the United States and not the United Nations had the main
                            initiative. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out
                            that the Geneva exercise did, however, deflate Turkish demands
                            significantly. He noted further that we have suffered in our relations
                            with Turkey because of their reaction to Geneva so that anything we do
                            now could simply make it tougher for the United Nations. The Secretary
                            observed in passing that since things change so rapidly these days, a 50
                            year lease on a base would seem long enough for an 80-year old Prime
                            Minister. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> stressed the view
                            that in any case a settlement involving base rights was not really
                            satisfactory since bases are becoming anachronisms. He noted, however,
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> Constantine said he had
                            three times asked <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if he
                            could accept the commitment of one of the British bases to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> did not reject this nor did the British. In
                            response to the Secretary's question, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said this could include Turkish soldiers and
                            specifically the Turkish <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0368"/>contingent on the base. He said this is an idea that he is trying to
                            sell to the Turks. He hopes to persuade them that this is better than a
                            sovereign base. It would appear not as a concession from Greece, but as
                            something which the Turks themselves had won. In any case, he felt on
                            the basis of his discussions with the Turks to date that they view their
                            position more realistically than he had expected.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> asked if the Cyprus
                            Constitution required that if the British give up their bases they must
                            be turned over to the Government of Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> said that this would not complicate <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-izing the base since it would in any
                            case be done through <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how the Department could best keep in touch with the
                            Mediator. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> suggested that he
                            could best continue his contacts through Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName>. He noted, however, that he
                            badly lacks intelligence reports and would appreciate assistance in this
                            regard. The Secretary agreed that we could help provided the information
                            was not passed to the Cypriots, Greeks or Turks. He cautioned also that
                            we could not guarantee the accuracy of our reports.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> stressed the
                            importance of keeping the mediation effort within the United Nations as
                            a United Nations initiative. He said the Americans are willing to take
                            the blame and consequences of Geneva; he would take the blame for the
                            mediation from now on. He realized that the United States is reluctant
                            to press the Turks, but asked that we support him when the Turks ask our
                            opinion of his approaches.</p>

                            Ambassador's categorical rejection of charge of U.S. involvement in
                            resignation was signal for cessation of govt press campaign against
                            U.S.; most pro-govt papers today headline denials of U.S. intervention
                            and except for pro-govt Ethnos, which initiated accusation, pro-govt
                            papers imply denials have clarified situation and removed any doubts of
                            U.S. complicity. Typical are headlines of sensational afternoon pro-govt
                            papers <hi rend="italic">Ta Nea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Athinaiki</hi>, both of which are usually critical of U.S.; <hi rend="italic">Athinaiki</hi> headlines: “No U.S. Intervention in A.

                        <p>Opposition <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> press had field day at
                            government expense on subject, with all <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> papers charging that <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was remiss in not rejecting charges earlier and that
                            Ambassador's statement “forced” <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> to denounce charges. Characteristic of <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> press is headline of influential <hi rend="italic">Kathimerini</hi>: “U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> amazed that resignation was
                            associated with Cyprus settlement—<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was forced to share amazement,” while conservative
                            Acropolis headlines: “Severe reply from U.S. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> forced <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> late last night to retract.”
                            Acropolis added: “U.S. Ambassador's statement was made when <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> in his statement in Parliament
                            virtually adopted and made official campaign of two Communist newspapers
                            and of certain govt newspapers with personal ties with Andreas
                            Papandreou against the Americans who were point blank accused of having
                            exerted pressure for resignation of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s son.”</p>
                        <p>Comment: <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s failure during
                            Parliamentary debate to denounce charges of U.S. intervention in his
                            son's resignation—charges which he knew were patently false—is
                            inexplicable. It is possible he was willing to go along with campaign
                            that made his son appear as “victim” of foreign pressure, despite damage
                            he knew it would do to U.S. prestige in Greece, in hope it would detract
                            attention from real reasons for resignation. It is also possible that by
                            billing Andreas as staunch defender of Greece's independent policies and
                            as defender of Cyprus, the Papandreous hoped to build up Andreas'
                            political appeal in country as well as within party where he was facing
                            increasing antagonisms. In any event, Ambassador's statement clearly
                            rejecting U.S. involvement forced <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> to take stand on issue, which he did by issuing
                            categorical, albeit tardy, denial. His delay in doing so, however,
                            opened him and his govt to opposition charges that he was using charges
                            of U.S. involvement as smokescreen for accusations of scandals involving
                            his son.</p>

                            our thinking and efforts during and even after Geneva discussions were
                            oriented toward modified form of enosis as solution which held out best
                            hope being definitive and of avoiding continuing trouble. However,
                            review of recent developments in Cyprus situation indicates changes in
                            several important factors which were previously determinants in our
                            policy thinking.</p>
                        <p>First and most important is that both <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> have in fact given
                            up idea of “instant enosis”, at least for the time being. Thus, while
                            enosis with sufficient compensations for Turkey may still remain
                            preferred US solution it retains little value as working concept in
                            shorter run.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, experience has shown us that no matter how much Papandreou
                            continues talk about building up <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            position on island, <pb n="333" xml:id="pg_333" facs="0371"/>he has
                            failed put <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> in position force enosis
                            on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> or even accelerate
                            pace of events. It now clear that on Greek side, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> alone will call tune as to
                            timing and nature of any significant steps toward enosis. This has
                            obvious implications for our long-standing assumption that nub of
                            problem was to get <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> talking, so that hopefully they could
                            reach compromise agreement which <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would have no choice but accept. What has
                            emerged, actually, is coincidence of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            and GOC interest (though for different reasons and perhaps for short
                            term only) in maintaining Cyprus' independence. Logically, this should
                            lead Turks and Greek Cypriots talk together but neither side seems ready
                            yet recognize this as tolerable alternative to present course of mutual
                            hostility (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 642).<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">Dated November 25. (Ibid.)</note> In meanwhile,
                            earlier open-mindedness of Turks to idea of modified enosis has changed.
                            Unhappy denouement of Geneva talks and their aftermath have made even
                            more acute feeling of Turks that they have been suffering unacceptable
                            losses to their position and their prestige. As consequence enosis has
                            again become dirty word for them, their whole attitude has stiffened and
                            they have reverted to original position of federation, with partition
                            relegated to automatic reaction if any overture made toward unilateral
                            enosis.</p>
                        <p>Another change in policy background has to do with Soviets' role and
                            influence. Will be recalled one of principal reasons for seeking
                            urgently obtain agreement last summer on modified enosis formula was to
                            abort growing Soviet influence in and over Cyprus and specifically to
                            forestall Greek Cypriot mission to Moscow. In interval not only Greek
                            Cypriots but Turks have been to Moscow. Although Russians may not have
                            intended Moscow discussions give as much encouragement to Turks as
                            latter reflect in conversations with US and others, nevertheless
                            discussions and joint communiqué, at a minimum, created new element of
                            uncertainty for Greeks and expectations for Turks. Thus, although does
                            not appear have been any change in basic Soviet position, Soviets can
                            now win kudos from both Greek Cypriots and Turks by taking public stance
                            in favor of independence which per se no longer appears, in Turkish eyes
                            at least, as pro-Makarios position.</p>
                        <p>Then, there is experience of Mediator himself. Despite Galo Plaza's
                            inveterate optimism and political virtuosity, including close rapport
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, his multiple
                            conversations with all parties concerned have not resulted in any
                            narrowing of gap (as Acheson's did) but instead have served reveal that
                            gap greater than was thought. Measure of bleakness Galo Plaza's
                            prospects is his decision defer submission his final report until after
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> discussion of Cyprus item.</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0372"/>
                        <p>In addition all of foregoing we constrained adduce one parochial but
                            nonetheless important consideration, which is continuing erosion of US
                            political stock in Turkey. Given fact we have had no choice but sail on
                            more or less straight line between Greek Scylla and Turk Charybdis, we
                            had to expect growing disillusionment and despair on part of Turkish
                            friends for our failure support them in position which they consider
                            right and honorable. This mood has gradually given way to one of
                            adapting themselves realistically to changed conditions but at same time
                            seeking opportunities make them as favorable as possible to Turkey's
                            needs, e.g., <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>'s Moscow visit
                            and federation pitch made to Galo Plaza.</p>
                        <p>Put in summary form, the Cyprus question, as far as <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is concerned, has changed greatly in
                            almost all of its aspects since we became actively concerned with
                            it.</p>
                        <p>First, problem itself has changed as our immediate objective of
                            preventing war between Greece and Turkey has essentially been
                            accomplished. It is true that Turks still talk grimly of war with Greece
                            if enosis should be carried out as a unilateral act but, as prospect of
                            such action fades due to Greek second thoughts and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> having other ideas,
                            likelihood of an armed clash recedes.</p>
                        <p>But unfortunately this does not get us out of woods since original major
                            problem has now been replaced by series of others, which are perhaps of
                            lesser magnitude individually but taken as a whole are not only
                            immediately troublesome but could have important long term effects in
                            the area and on our position in it. Turkey and Greece, on whose past
                            cooperation so much depended, are now at daggers drawn and prospects are
                            for further deterioration. Greece and Turkey who were model members of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, are now unhappy critics of
                            that organization and partisans of non-alignment are raising voices.
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is under severe criticism in
                            Nicosia, Athens and Ankara, which is unpleasant but bearable in its
                            spleenish aspect but has serious implications as regards our specific
                            national interests in Greece and Turkey which tend run parallel
                            qualitatively but are considerably greater in Turkey quantitatively.
                            Result is that problem which started out as primarily affecting others
                            has now become one in which our own interests are directly involved and
                            fact that war threat has receded should not leave us in doubt as to real
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>In circumstances it would seem this time for re-evaluation in order
                            determine whether policy evolved under other circumstances still holds
                            good. If so, it should be consciously revalidated in terms which are
                            explicable in light of present realities. If not, we should see what
                            could be done by way of modification or substitution. In this
                            re-examination cognizance should first be taken of fact that range of
                            possibilities for settlement has been greatly reduced by exclusion of
                            idea of early enosis, whether in unilateral, conditional or double form.
                            This means scrapping Geneva concept and leaves independence, even though
                            non-permanent, as <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0373"/>single
                            remaining solution with only question being determination of what kind
                            of independence. As matters stand <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Galo Plaza appear in agreement in principle
                            if not in detail on an independent, unaligned, demilitarized Cyprus with
                            certain minority right provisions for Turk Cypriots, and Papandreou's
                            having pretty much chucked in his hand, is now taking position that
                            anything that suits <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            will go for him. This also would seem to be what Sovs would like since
                            it would lead to pressure on British to give up their base rights and
                            leave Turkey and Greece estranged and good for troubled waters fishing.
                            This also coincides with Turkish policy to extent that it would block
                            enosis but it leaves sharp cleavage on form which independence would
                            take and it is on this narrowed but clearly defined gap that all the
                            asperity and emotionalism which have characterized this problem in past
                            are now concentrated in situation where both sides remain as deeply
                            entrenched as ever in their positions with result that hope for agreed
                            solution remains perhaps even more remote than before. In fact,
                            Papandreou has categorically gone back to his original position of
                            excluding all talks with Turks and there is no indication that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, still confident of success
                            without compromises will be any more flexible in future than in
                            past.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason that policy of advocating agreed solution, although
                            having possible tactical advantages in situation where we (and also
                            British) are at wits end act positively, is, following Geneva
                            break-down, dead-end street as far as Turks concerned and leads them
                            endeavor induce US break log-jam by coming out in support of what they
                            profess believe type of independence adapted to realities of situation.
                            Unfortunately their nerves are pretty raw these days and they sometimes
                            put their arguments in heavy handed form which is aggravating but this
                            should not obscure fact that, regardless of form of presentation or our
                            ability do something about it, this is normal approach in situation
                            where Turks still deeply feel that something needs be done to redress
                            imbalance but repeatedly stress that they would be open to compromise if
                            real dialogue could be initiated.</p>
                        <p>This then is situation in which we find ourselves and in light of which
                            review would seem in order. Should decision emerge from such study to
                            give some form of support to principles of federation, we should realize
                            that we might be backing horse that would never get far down track
                            (Nicosia's 775 to Dept).<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5">Telegram 775 from
                                Nicosia, November 27, reported that a Cypriot federation could only
                                be imposed by force. (Ibid.)</note> On other hand, there would be
                            certain equity in making attempt since it would amount to giving Turk
                            solution fair try as we did with enosis this past summer. It is
                            foreseen, however, that it would be difficult to give type of general
                            pig-in-poke endorsement of federation which Turks suggest. Furthermore,
                            it would seem to be <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0374"/>wishful
                            thinking on part of Turks to assume that a word from US would cause Galo
                            Plaza to retrim his sails and still more improbable that Soviets would
                            fall in line (although, unlikely as it may be, sight should not be lost
                            of possibility that they might take initiative themselves if this suited
                            their purposes. After all in terms Soviet geopolitics Turkey easily
                            remains at top of priority list). However, this does not alter fact that
                            real imbalance exists, that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has upper hand and that some concession by him
                            is essential if matter is to be directed on more hopeful course. This
                            observation is made in knowledge that current GOC policy is antithesis

                            which natural as far as GOC concerned but would make shambles of our
                            relations here for simple reason that it would be directed to solution
                            of greater rather than lesser imbalance in situation where our influence
                            should presumably be directed to latter not only as matter simple
                            justice but also in our own over-all interests. If <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, hopefully with assistance of Galo
                            Plaza, could use influence to persuade GOC to undertake negotiations in
                            spirit of sincere compromise there might be some hope. If not, all doors
                            for helpful action prior <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> would
                            seem tightly shut since obvious <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>

                        <p>Question currently posed, therefore, is whether we see any useful purpose
                            could be served by putting renewed pressure on GOC primarily and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> secondarily to take first step toward
                            compromise solution and mutatis mutandis advise Turks as discreetly as
                            possible of our views. In so doing, would be important make clear we not

                            clearly described painful dilemma in which US finds itself namely that
                            we cannot press forward on course which would provide permanent solution
                            to Cyprus problem without at same time seriously damaging, if not
                            destroying, our important relationship with Turkey. Since this is so,
                            agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> that
                            practical question now before us is what kind of independent Cyprus and
                            is there anything US can or should do to shape this independence.
                            Stating question another way is what kind of independent Cyprus can
                            Turkey live with over next few years.</p>
                        <p>Our analysis of proposals reftel is based on following assumptions: 1)
                            federation of Cyprus really means partition of Cyprus and therefore will
                            require force to be imposed; 2) <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is in no mood to negotiate precisely because as
                            reftel puts it he has upper hand and 3) US has very little leverage on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and because of our
                            proposed stand in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> we are likely to
                            have even less influence.</p>
                        <p>Federation as envisaged by Turk-Cypriot leaders and we suppose by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is solution which might possibly be
                            imposed temporarily at great cost by force of arms. Admittedly we have
                            not yet got a definition of this all important word but before we go any
                            further down this dangerous road we should know exactly what is in mind
                            in Ankara. Geographic separation of most of two communities with
                            boundaries cutting Famagusta and Nicosia and running west to Kokkina
                            area is Turk Cypriot meaning. This is not merely a horse which can't go
                            far down the track. It will stop any race which might possibly lead to
                            an agreed solution through the efforts of the Mediator. Also worth
                            noting again that Galo Plaza will need a lot of proselytizing on this
                            one and obviously concept ought to be checked out thoroughly with him
                            before we make any decision. We convinced there is no chance of selling
                            this concept to Greek Cypriots generally or to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in particular.</p>
                        <p>Since <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has refused to agree to talk
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, possibility that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> who knows that he is master
                            of Cypriot house would agree to talk with Turks would seem to be even
                            more remote. As we have been regularly reporting and which reftel
                            recognizes, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Greek
                            Cypriots have preponderance of power, de facto control of government
                            machinery, and strong determination to reach goal of “unfettered
                            independence.” <pb n="338" xml:id="pg_338" facs="0376"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would react to
                            suggestion to negotiate as another example of pressure to give up
                            positions which he has already won over Turkish Cypriots. Therefore, not
                            only would he refuse but if he follows past practice, would likely kick
                            off another round of anti-US/<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            hysteria claiming foreign interference once again. Moreover, as long as
                            GOC has indicated to Greek Cypriot public that answer to problem lies in
                            resolution at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, it would be
                            politically impossible for GOC leadership to agree to undertake talks
                            with GOC. In sum, we cannot detect any spirit of compromise here, at
                            all. All shades of opinion, even those who deep down are for “instant
                            enosis” at this stage of game agree with GOC public position that next
                            step is <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and the best effort should
                            be made there to obtain world consensus to invalidate treaties and
                            resolution supporting unfettered independence and principle of
                            self-determination.</p>
                        <p> GOC/<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> current strategy is
                            maintain facade of reasonableness combined with unilateral action of
                            non-provocative nature. Meantime GOC proceeding step by step put into
                            effect most of 13 points first promulgated year ago just prior to
                            opening scene present tragedy. GOC already has accomplished de facto
                            majority rule in Parliament, unified judiciary, abolished separate
                            municipalities, and is considering new tax and measure to abolish Greek
                            Communal Chamber. Such measures will continue to be applied between now
                            and <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. After these “milestones” no
                            matter what nature of resolution, Greeks here will probably promulgate
                            new constitution providing framework for unitary state. The prospect is
                            chilling for Turk Cypriots; they will be ignored and left to wither on
                            vine like Arab refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and Gaza. At same time there
                            is little likelihood that GOC will give new provocation to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to intervene.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, subsequent to <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and
                            assuming GOC cannot get satisfaction in wording of resolution, we shall
                            see not just continuation of series of faits accomplis establishing
                            unitary state, but we shall also see accelerated leftward drift with all
                            the trouble this means for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            installations and British bases. Therefore erosion of Western position,
                            not to mention steady decay of Turkish Cypriot situation, both political
                            and economic, to advantage only of Communists on island and elsewhere is
                            something GOT must face. Turks (and we) must be prepared to live with
                            this situation.</p>
                        <p>We must also recognize unhappy fact that except for our influence with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, US now has little influence on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Our modest aid
                            programs are aimed chiefly at reestablishing some semblance of normality
                            for Turkish community and to keep our foot in door while maintaining
                            some momentum in <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            “peace offensive.” They would have only marginal effect in getting GOC
                            to do anything else. On other hand, GOC has relatively good leverage on
                            us in shape of our communications facilities. After <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> wherein we and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will be villains of piece, GOC <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0377"/>frustrations will be focused on US
                            installations as most accessible target of vituperation and next on
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> bases rather than on Turks (who
                            strike back).</p>
                        <p>All these developments will involve no compensation to Turks and there
                            will be no way of accurately measuring costly consequences to Alliance
                            of which Turkey a vital link.</p>
                        <p>Under circumstances since we do not have means of persuading <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to accept solution in best interests of
                            Alliance, we must examine ways in which to ease burden for them. Perhaps
                            as Galo Plaza and British seem to think, they will find <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> educational experience and may emerge
                            more malleable and thereby more susceptible to mediation effort, or
                            failing that, when tempers have chance to cool they may be somewhat
                            affected by realization US and West generally are losing on island. Even
                            perhaps after dust settles and Turks can quietly come to realization
                            that in fact there is no Turkish Cypriot position left on island, some
                            face saving device can be devised where Turks bow to world opinion and
                            to interests of Alliance in stemming leftward drift in Cyprus and
                            perhaps also Greece. In meantime, if Turks, we and British can face sort
                            of deterioration in all our positions described above, then we see the
                            best intermediate policy for US as one of inaction combined with
                            positive attempts to establish effective relationship with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. If we do not choose even
                            this path, then it is hard for us to see where we and Mediator can look
                            further knowing that federation à la Turque is as much a casus belli for
                            Greeks as enosis is for Turks.</p>
                        <p>This cable started out to be merely a somewhat strengthened reiteration
                            of our previous commentary on hopelessness of selling peaceful
                            federation here. We realize that Dept has in effect turned down (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 403)<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">Dated November 17. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27

                        <p>During his December 4 talk with Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>, the Secretary asked him for
                            his evaluation of Soviet policy. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that when he was in Moscow at the end
                            of September 1964,<note n="2" xml:id="d168fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> visited Moscow
                                September 26–October 1.</note> the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister,
                            Kuznetzov, had told him that the Soviet Government prefers Cyprus to
                            remain an independent state. Enosis would bring about the union of
                            Cyprus with a member state of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated, however,
                            that Kuznetzov had remarked that if the people of Cyprus want enosis
                            (union with Greece), the Soviet Government would respect this
                            preference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that the Soviets
                            had described to him the line which they were getting from the Turkish
                            Government on federation. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that he told the Soviets that this
                            solution was out of the question completely. It was not a solution at
                            all, he said—it would lead to partition.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> observed that he did not
                            see <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> during his visit
                            but that he had been introduced to <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kosygin</persName> with whom he had a lengthy conversation.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kosygin</persName> was not yet then Prime
                                Minister.<note n="3" xml:id="d168fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_KA1">Kosygin</persName> became Prime Minister
                                on October 15, following the overthrow of <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Soviets further told <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            that they continued to regard the London treaties of Cyprus as unequal,
                            exactly as Soviet Representative Fedorenko had stated in the Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> remarked that he thought
                            there was little change in the Soviet position on Cyprus except for the
                            fact that they might be getting <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0379"/>closer to the Turks on the question of opposing Cypriot union with
                            Greece. He believed that the Cypriots could still count on Soviet
                            support on matters such as Cypriot independence, territorial integrity
                            and sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>In response to the Secretary's question as to whether or not a General
                            Assembly discussion of Cyprus would embitter the atmosphere, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that the Assembly
                            debate would help if it produced the right kind of resolution. Such a
                            resolution might provide a way out of the problem of finding a solution
                            to the Cyprus question. On the other hand, if the Assembly does not
                            produce the right kind of resolution, the mediator's role would be
                            frustrated or ended by “developments”. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> later observed that if it were not for the
                            tactical problem, the Cypriot Government could even suggest in the
                            debate the inclusion in the resolution of statements on guarantees for
                            the Turk Cypriots in order to make “the way out” easier for the Turkish
                            Government with its own military people. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> remarked that in Turkey, public opinion does
                            not exist.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the Security Council had noted the importance
                            of an agreed solution to the Cyprus problem and remarked that the
                            Assembly could not circumvent that.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied
                            that by avoiding any mention of how the settlement will be brought about
                            and by enunciating principles which would set the framework for a
                            solution, the Assembly could play a useful role. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stressed that he did not want
                            anything in the Assembly resolution which would strengthen the veto
                            which already is implicit in the agreed solution formula.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that the trouble with enunciating principles of
                            the Charter was that one can cite principles which clash. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that “we like all
                            articles of the Charter”. He said the Government of Cyprus supports
                            respect for treaties but not treaties or interpretations of treaties
                            which are in contradiction with the Charter, which supersedes all
                            treaties according to Article 103.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what progress had been made on his suggestion of
                            “killing the Turk Cypriots with kindness.” <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> observed that he had relayed to Makarios
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s advice in this
                                regard.<note n="4" xml:id="d168fn4">See <ref target="#d159">Document
                                    159</ref>.</note> He stressed that there had been progress in
                            restoring normal conditions stating that in Limassol, Larnaca, and
                            Famagusta things were entirely normal as far as free circulation was
                            concerned and in Paphos conditions were improving, although there was
                            still a problem of Turkish Cypriots being prevented by the Turk Cypriot
                            leadership from returning to their homes. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stressed that the central problem is in
                            Nicosia “where the Turkish Army is.”</p>
                        <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0380"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> described the new law on
                            the judicial system and the makeup of the Supreme Court. He emphasized
                            that Turkish judges were taking part in spite of the opposition of the
                            Turkish Cypriot political leadership. He said he believed the judges had
                            convinced the Government of Turkey that it was in the interest of the
                            Turkish Cypriot people for these judges to participate in the new
                            judicial system.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> observed that the
                            Government of Cyprus is trying to implement a new law unifying the
                            municipalities.</p>
                        <p>He also observed that a small Armenian minority was suffering worse than
                            either Greeks or Turks on Cyprus, stating that the Armenians suffered
                            mainly at the hands of the Turks. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that if the Turkish Cypriots would open
                            up their communications and permit their people to move freely out of
                            their sections of town and permit Greeks to move freely through them, it
                            would be a big step toward the return to normalcy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what the economic balance sheet for 1964 of Cyprus
                            would be. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that
                            exports had increased and imports had decreased, improving the balance
                            of payments. The Secretary observed jestingly that perhaps there were
                            some imports in 1964 that were not on the customs lists.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> asked the
                            Secretary what would be useful in an Assembly resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that he felt that the process itself of discussing
                            Cyprus in the Assembly was an inflammatory one, and stated that he was
                            studying Article 33 of the Charter on whether or not it was wise to
                            resort to the General Assembly with a problem of this kind.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> if
                            his Government had any contacts with the Turks and their leaders.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that there
                            were none and that such contacts were very difficult. He observed that
                            the mediator kept in touch with Turk Cypriot leaders. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that in London on his way
                            to New York, he had heard a rumor that there would be some changes in
                            the Turk Cypriot leadership on the island. This rumor suggested that
                            certain Turk Cypriot leaders would be leaving the island and certain
                            other ones coming in to take their places.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary inquired as to what possibility there was for the parties
                            to the Cyprus dispute to “trade” and through a quid pro quo work out a
                            solution. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that
                            the Cypriot bargaining position was weak. Cyprus had nothing to offer.
                            All it can offer is guarantees to the minority. But it cannot offer part
                            of Cyprus to Turkey, or “we'd all be hanged.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that we did not see any solution now. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that the Government of
                            Cyprus does not see a solution either and was therefore not urging Galo
                            Plaza to bring out a report <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0381"/>before the General Assembly met. Galo Plaza was looking forward to the
                            Assembly, he said, hoping it would assist his work.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> then went over the
                            primary Turkish Government sine qua nons in the Cyprus problem:</p>
                        <p>1) Rights of the Turkish Cypriots</p>
                        <p>2) Security</p>
                        <p>3) Prestige</p>
                        <p>He remarked that if the Cypriots were to be independent, they could not
                            accept demilitarization of the island, unless the Turks did
                            likewise.</p>
                        <p>If the solution were enosis, however, demilitarization could be involved.
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            observed that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee could
                            perhaps be obtained.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what progress was being made internally with the
                            Greek Cypriots on the shape of a solution. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> remarked that some Turks were amenable to an
                            agreement, but without Turkish Government agreement, the Turkish
                            leadership on the island would be unlikely to be agreeable. The Foreign
                            Minister felt that the Turkish Cypriots for the most part, do not have a
                            preference as to independence or enosis but are most interested in where
                            they can get reliable guarantees of human rights. He thought that they
                            would be happy to accept these if they involve some degree in autonomy
                            and religion, culture, education, and personal status, combined with
                            some Government financial assistance.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we see no solution in
                            direction either enosis or double enosis. If progress appears possible
                            toward independent Cyprus with protection of Turk minority, we should
                            strive for this. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we
                            would do our best preserve sanctity of treaties in GA. He said he was
                                <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0382"/>assured that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> will support our position in GA. Since
                            there is general agreement that present treaty system not working and
                            since we hold to principle that treaties can be changed only by
                            agreement, next step should be negotiations looking toward security of
                            rights of Turk Cypriots in manner that does not impair sovereignty of an
                            independent Cyprus.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said he much comforted by
                            position outlined by Under Secretary. In his view, adequate security for
                            Turk Cypriots meant federal system with separated communities. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> responded by repeating his views
                            as indicated above. (In earlier conversations with <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>, <gloss target="#t_memcon1">memcon</gloss>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> getting everything
                            his way. Only obstacles to complete <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> victory are continued separation Turkish
                            community and strong points in Turkish hands. If Turk community accedes
                            to proposals by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> or Galo
                            Plaza to return to homes and give up strong points to <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will have completed “fait accompli” and can
                            claim no further problem exists. <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said this assessment accounts for Turk refusal
                            discuss <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> proposals.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said, after US stopped Turk
                            invasion, Greeks sent 10,000 troops to island without public
                            condemnation from US. Turk leaders might understand reasons, but
                            impossible explain to Turkish people. Russians successfully exploiting
                            situation with strong propaganda effort.</p>
                        <p>On next steps after GA, Under Secretary asked whether <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> thought <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might appropriately call for negotiating meeting.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EN1">Erim</persName> said <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was reluctant become further involved but
                            might make suggestion if requested by US. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we would discuss this with British.</p>

                            403 to Nicosia.<note n="2" xml:id="d170fn2">Telegram 1041 from Athens,
                                January 8, reported Greek concern that U.S. insistence on
                                inviolability of treaties would strengthen Turkey's position in U.N.
                                discussions. (Ibid.) In telegram 1071 from Athens, January 15,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> reported that

                            Para 1 Athens 1071 suggests that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            misunderstands US views on question of including reference to
                            international treaties in any GA resolution on Cyprus. Might be useful
                            to set <hi rend="italic">Costopoulos</hi> or Pilivakis straight next
                            time either raises Cyprus question.</p>
                        <p>As indicated <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 403 to Nicosia
                            (rptd other addressees) US feels strongly that GA should not interpret
                            or modify international agreements or give moral sanction to their
                            unilateral repudiation except in accordance with agreement's abrogation
                            clause if any. GA powers under Article 14 to recommend measures for
                            peaceful settlement of disputes are to be interpreted consistently with
                            Charter's objective of promoting “respect for the obligations arising
                            from treaties …” (Preamble). We feel sure this view shared by large
                            number <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member states.</p>
                        <p>It is not, however, our position that any resolution, regardless of its
                            terms, must inevitably contain paragraph affirming continued validity of
                                L/<gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss> agreements. Whether US would
                            advocate inclusion in any resolution on Cyprus of language specifically
                            upholding legal validity of Agreements will depend on circumstances,
                            including question of whether such resolution tended to call into
                            question validity those Agreements.</p>
                        <p>While as <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> knows, US holds L/<gloss target="#t_Z1">Z</gloss> Agreements still legally valid, we do not
                            consider them immutable. In fact, realities of situation make clear they
                            will have to be changed in some respects. However, any changes in
                            Agreements should be product of negotiations among parties.</p>
                        <p> FYI: We prefer not to tell <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> at this
                            time whether Cypriot draft Res would meet test outlined in foregoing. GA
                            debate on Cyprus item still some weeks off, and Cypriot Res in present
                            form may, or may not, be an active document when debate begins. However,
                            as stressed in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 403, Cairo type
                            resolution would cast doubt on validity of Treaty Guarantee <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0384"/>and certain basic articles of Cyprus

                            of Cairo Res and presents same problems in terms our position. Operative

                            Article 103 of Charter.</p>
                        <p>Operative para 2 of Cyprus draft would have GA call on “all states in
                            conformity with their obligations under the Charter, and in particular
                            Article 2, paragraphs 1 and 4 …” to refrain from threat or use of force
                            or “intervention directed against Cyprus.” This obviously included as
                            challenge to Article 4 Treaty of Guarantee. End FYI.</p>

                        <p>941. Paid routine call on President Friday.</p>
                        <p>After covering number of incidental items, raised problem of Cyprus issue
                            in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> in view Article 19 problem.
                            Said we would be interested knowing what GOC plans were for period after
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> disposed of issue in General
                            Assembly assuming voting problem settled. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> reminded me that he had always maintained that
                            no matter what sort of resolution came out of General Assembly, whether
                            good or bad from Greek Cypriot point of view, he realized <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had no capability for imposing whatever
                            solution recommended. Therefore problem of future remained where it had
                            always been—with people of Cyprus. Said he was giving serious
                            consideration to promulgation of new Constitution (this is idea
                            mentioned to me more than once by <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>) which could be put forward on temporary ad
                            referendum basis pending final approval by people as a whole. He
                            observed that Turk Cypriots might or might not <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0385"/>accept Constitution at that time, but
                            this made little difference to him under circumstances. Whatever happens
                            at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and whatever his decision may be
                            regarding possible new Constitution Archbishop assured me he had no
                            intention using further violence to impose Greek Cypriot will on Turks.
                            He would give <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> no excuse for
                            intervention and certainly had no intention of declaring enosis with
                            Greece until he certain Greece understood possible consequences and
                            prepared accept them. In his mind this ruled out enosis for time being
                            since appeared be casus belli for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.
                            When I pointed out that it all very well to govern under some new
                            constitutional framework but that this did not provide for
                            “normalization” and eradication of physical barriers now existing
                            between two communities, Archbishop said that this matter was up to
                            Turks. They were free as far as he concerned to stay as they were behind
                            Green Line and within their ghettoes if they chose not to play part in
                            life of state under new Constitution. Said he was following Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s good advice to

                            belief that in time more and more Turkish Cypriots would accept facts of

                        <p>In view numerous press rumors of possibility GOC planning conversations
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> or even with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> indicated he was not in favor of talks at this
                            time since he feared they likely be unsuccessful and failure of talks to
                            produce substantive progress might well only worsen situation. He would
                            not be drawn out on question of possible trip to Athens but commented on
                            my use of words “other interested parties” with reference to possible
                            talks. With considerable emphasis <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said that as far as he concerned only
                            interested parties to internal aspect of Cyprus disputes were two
                            communities in Cyprus. Since Greek Cypriot community in majority they
                            would determine fate of island, of course taking into account legitimate
                            rights of Turk minority. Reiterated they had no intention using force in
                            this connection but would rely on time being on their side. On several
                            occasions he reiterated his ultimate aim for Cyprus was enosis but that
                            as responsible leader and with Greek interests at heart he could not do
                            anything which would be against the pursuit of this age-old aim of Greek
                            Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>With regard Gromyko statement,<note n="2" xml:id="d171fn2">Reference is
                                to the Soviet proposal for a “federal” form of government in Cyprus,
                                made in an interview in <hi rend="italic">Izvestia</hi>, January
                                21.</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said this was further
                            evidence that Soviets like all nations were pursuing own national
                            interests and it quite obvious that there was much more at stake for
                            them in Turkey than in Cyprus. Said he believed Soviets had decided
                            against wholehearted support of Greek Cypriots and were now obviously
                            intensively <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0386"/>wooing Turks. Said
                            he felt there something basically inconsistent in Gromyko statement with
                            regard federation as possible solution. This would merely perpetuate
                            divisions within island and make even more difficult achievement of
                            ostensible Soviet aim of viable independent unitary state. Said it
                            obvious that Soviets (as well as UAR) against enosis for own national
                            interest, but by proposing solution which perpetuated divisions, Soviets
                            at same time were creating system in which dream of enosis and
                            “double-enosis” would continue be ultimate aim of both Greeks and Turks
                            in island. Added he personally utterly opposed to federation concept and
                            could not see how it could be applied in Cyprus in view of distribution
                            of minority throughout island.</p>
                        <p>While President did not say so specifically, it was obvious he not too
                            perturbed by nature Gromyko statement since it contained many words
                            having great appeal to Greeks. Federation concept merely mentioned as
                            one possibility and Greek reject this but cling to remainder of
                            statement supporting territorial integrity, no foreign intervention and
                            continued independence of island. From his response to my comment
                            Gromyko's words would bolster Turks' spirits considerably, it was
                            obvious that this made little difference to him. (President later issued
                            following press statement: “The Soviet Foreign Minister's statement is
                            open to various interpretations. In my view the Soviet Union supports,
                            in the case of Cyprus, independence unfettered by treaties. But I cannot
                            say that Moscow favors union of Cyprus with Greece.”)</p>
                        <p>In response suggestion that there might be something on which to find
                            basis for common ground in fact that we now found Soviets, Turks and, at
                            least for near future, Greek Cypriots supporting concept of independent
                            Cyprus, President commented that he found no room for compromise beyond
                            providing Turks with rights and guarantees offered minorities in other
                            states. If this could constitute common ground then there should be
                            possibility of Turk Cypriot participation in life of country.</p>

                        <p>961. FYI. In separate conversations with Secretary and Under Secretary
                            January 26, Turkish Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> reported that Greek <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation had been in touch twice recently (apparently
                            within previous day or two) with member Turkish delegation. Greeks had
                            frankly expressed their growing conviction that nothing leading toward
                            Cyprus solution would come out of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.
                            Had proposed, therefore, that tripartite Greek-Turkish-Cypriot talks be
                            arranged. In first conversation, Turk representative had suggested
                            Greeks talk to <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> about
                            this. Second contact was made by chief Greek delegate Bitsios who
                            reported <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> was consulting
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> for
                            instructions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> seemed regard this as
                            encouraging sign and to be quite ready undertake at least bilateral
                            talks with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, provided they could be
                            kept completely secret. He asked that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> speak to Greeks, without revealing his approach to us,
                            to urge such talks. Both Secretary and Under Secretary endorsed
                            bilateral negotiation, and <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>
                            was assured we would make approach to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>When specifically queried about Turkish attitude toward tripartite talks,
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> first expressed fear
                            British would insist upon being included because of their worries about
                            Cyprus bases. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said he
                            thought British might be so relieved to have something going on which
                            might lead to solution that they would not insist on taking part.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> later said that if
                            Greek Cypriots included in discussions, Turkey would have to insist that
                            representatives of Turkish Cypriots likewise be present. Again indicated
                            his preference for initial talks with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> alone.</p>
                        <p>Suggestion was made that there might be better chance of bringing Greeks
                            to negotiating table if Turks indicated willingness to talk about all
                            outstanding issues between Greece and Turkey, rather than Cyprus alone.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> balked at this, saying
                            Cyprus was of overriding importance, but did suggest <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would be willing sign undertaking with
                            Greeks to settle other problems once agreement had been reached on
                            Cyprus. Dept officer commented this, of course, was matter of tactics
                            which hopefully Turks could work out in further preliminary contacts
                            with GOG representatives.</p>
                        <p>Re substance of possible solution for Cyprus, <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> once more spoke of federation as only logical way
                            out, since modified enosis exemplified <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0388"/>in first Acheson Plan had proven unacceptable to
                            Greeks. Insisted that physical separation of Greek and Turkey Cypriots
                            would not be nearly so difficult as people asserted. More than half
                            Turkish Cypriots were concentrated in area north of Nicosia. (Dept
                            officer pointed out these people would need much greater area than they
                            currently occupied if they were to support themselves permanently.
                                <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> agreed.) Turkey, he
                            said, would not insist on forced transfer of all Greeks out of Turkish
                            area or all Turks out of Greek area. It would undertake not to annex
                            Turkish area to Turkey unless Greece took rest of island for Greece. We
                            avoided any commitment to support federation, saying we still believed
                            parties must work things out among themselves without outside
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator's
                            position, with <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName> reporting he
                            had seen Galo Plaza January 25. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> had said he would make final round of capitals
                            concerned after <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debate on Cyprus
                            and then submit report. If it appeared debate was to be indefinitely
                            postponed, he would make his rounds without waiting for it and submit
                            report. It was agreed this line presented dangers and that Dept would
                            try to talk things over in Washington in near future. It was also
                            agreed, at <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>'s insistence,
                            that nothing would be said to Mediator about possible Greek-Turkish
                            talks. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>In light of foregoing but without revealing any knowledge of Greek
                            approach to Turks or <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>'s
                            approach to us on subject, please take earliest opportunity renew to

                            suggestion that direct, private negotiations between parties immediately
                            concerned offer best hope of progress toward Cyprus settlement.<note n="2" xml:id="d172fn2">Telegram 1163 from Athens, February 2,
                                reported that the Greek Government had responded to Turkish

                                Turkish Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                                added that a change in the Greek approach might be possible

                                Assembly debate on Cyprus. (Ibid.)</note> You may put forward as our
                            view growing conviction that <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>
                            debate and whatever resolution may emerge from it is most unlikely move
                            question any farther forward. In fact, we could not say with any real
                            confidence at this moment that debate will even take place in near
                            future in view of situation in GA. Therefore, it seems futile to lose
                            time and possibly see situation deteriorate while waiting for something
                            which has so little promise of positive results. We continue believe
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> desires talk to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, probably secretly at first, and hope
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will make contact directly to
                            explore this with Turks.</p>
                        <p>If Greeks insist on participation Cypriot Government in talks you should
                            urge they keep open mind on this and not make it firm condition.
                            Important thing is to get something started. From past experience we
                            would judge both Greeks and Turks would prefer avoid public attention
                                <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0389"/>to their contacts, and this
                            would obviously be much more difficult if additional parties added to
                            negotiations in early stages.</p>
                        <p>If it seems appropriate, you may say that we do not think it would be
                            helpful to bring <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mediator or other

                            distrust <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> so much they would

                        <p>On January 27 Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> informed us Greek <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation again in touch with Turkish delegation with
                            news that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> believes time
                            not right for tripartite talks. <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Menemencioglu</persName> consequently feels chance for successful
                            outcome of recent contacts remote. End FYI. Nevertheless, we believe you
                            should proceed with above approach and point out to Greeks that some
                            kind of bilateral talks even more essential if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> unwilling enter discussions

                        </list>
                        <p>I met with King Constantine, at his request, on the afternoon of January
                            27. The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> apparently had no
                            special reason for asking me to see him, other than to exchange views on
                            the general political and economic situation affecting Greece. The
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> observed that things
                            were “in a mess” referring both to the internal Greek scene and to
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Internal Political Problems</p>
                        <p> King Constantine remarked that there was much talk about the spread of
                            communism within Greece, and while he thought there had <pb n="352" xml:id="pg_352" facs="0390"/>been some growth in the activity and
                            boldness of the extreme left which caused him concern, he believed the
                            press comment and other talk on the subject was exaggerated. I said that
                            our observations led us to a similar conclusion although we agreed that
                            the matter should be carefully watched.</p>
                        <p> Constantine then said that some people (unidentified) had wanted him to
                            act against the Papandreou Government but he did not consider a move in
                            this direction wise or practicable, at least at this time. There was no
                            one on the scene who could replace Papandreou, as the latter still had a
                            strong popular appeal among the Greek people. He went so far as to say
                            that if he should try to unseat the Prime Minister now, Papandreou would
                            “go into the streets.”</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> then commented on the
                            appointment of <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> as
                            Minister of Interior. He recalled a meeting some time ago with
                            Papandreou in which the latter had volunteered that he would never
                            appoint <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> to the Interior
                                Ministry.<note n="2" xml:id="d173fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Elias Tsirimokos</persName>, former
                                leader of the Democratic Union Party, was a critic of U.S. policies
                                in Greece with ties to <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> reported on his
                                discussions with Papandreou on the <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> appointment in telegram 1103 from Athens,
                                January 21. (Ibid., POL US–GREECE) <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> became Minister of the Interior in
                                February 1964.</note> Later, when the Prime Minister came to him to
                            say that he wanted to make that very appointment, the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> sought to elicit the reasons for
                            Papandreou's change of heart, but he could obtain no satisfactory
                            explanation except “political desirability.” Constantine said that he
                            tried to argue the Prime Minister out of making the appointment but
                            that, although he felt the latter came close to giving in, he finally
                            stood his ground saying that it would cause him to lose face if it
                            should become known that he had given in to the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> on this particular issue.
                            Constantine observed to Papandreou that “if the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> should happen to have a good idea
                            once in a while there was no reason to reject it just because he was the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>.” But the Prime Minister
                            stood firm and the appointment was made.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> told me that he had
                            initially considered standing up to Papandreou over the <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> appointment, forcing the
                            Prime Minister's resignation. However, he sensed that a possible trap
                            was being laid for him and he was not sufficiently sure that he could
                            win if he stood his ground.</p>
                        <p>As he seemed to be desirous of some reaction from me on this, I observed
                            that I could well understand the importance of his being reasonably sure
                            of success before taking on the Prime Minister. I told him that I had
                            been approached by persons suggesting that the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> should unseat the government and
                            that my reply had been that I thought the circumstances not propitious
                            and that if the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> acted
                            prematurely he could do the regime irreparable harm. I went on to say
                            that there might well come <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0391"/>a
                            time when he would feel he must act, but I cautioned him not to do
                            anything hastily. He agreed and then said that if Papandreou should
                            “tamper with the Army as he has with the gendarmerie,” he would
                            definitely make this an issue and would call for the Prime Minister's
                            resignation.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether there were any indications that the Prime Minister is
                            contemplating any such action against the Army Officer Corps, but the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> did not think this was
                            in the cards at the moment. He mentioned that Papandreou had at one
                            point wanted to move <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>
                            from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of Coordination but both
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> had objected.</p>
                        <p>We then spoke of the deterioration of the general economic situation in
                            Greece. The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s views
                            coincided with those of the Embassy; namely, that whereas there has been
                            some deterioration and will doubtless be more, a real disenchantment
                            with Papandreou among the public because of failure of his economic
                            policies will not be felt for some months at least. The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> then observed that meanwhile the
                            main problem was to maintain and strengthen the forces of law and order
                            to offset possible increased boldness from the extreme left.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the opposition party <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> said that it was holding
                            together but that there was no outstanding leader who could inspire the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I asked the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> what Grivas was
                            doing in Athens, to which he replied that he was here to “seek more
                            authority.” <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> apparently
                            wishes more authority over the Greek forces in Cyprus and also is asking
                            for some additional Greek officers to assist him with the Greek Cypriot
                            forces. The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> does not believe
                            that the additional authority will be given him, but made no further
                            comment about the additional officers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> had called on the
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> that morning and, during
                            the conversation, Constantine asked <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> whether Cyprus would accept the Acheson plan at
                            this time. <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> reportedly
                            replied that although he personally was more receptive now than he had
                            been, he could not persuade the Cypriot people “to go that far.”</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> then went on to stress
                            the point he has made during previous conversations with me that the
                            deterioration of the situation in Greece was partly due to the continued
                            Cyprus crisis and that it was most important that an early solution be
                            found. I agreed, pointing out the various efforts we had made to
                            encourage an agreed solution and repeating again our position concerning
                            the necessity for the parties themselves to get together for talks. I
                            told him that I saw no possibility of any solution coming from the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debates, stressing the
                            limitations of power in the General Assembly on this issue. He said that
                            it was because <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0392"/>he realized that
                            nothing would probably come out of the General Assembly discussion that
                            he thought other efforts should be made.</p>
                        <p>He then said that he was searching in his own mind for some possible way
                            out of the impasse and went on to outline a proposal which was
                            thoroughly confusing. He inquired what would happen if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could be persuaded “to
                            declare Cyprus independent, asking all troops to leave the island and
                            saying that he would thereafter negotiate with the Turkish Government re
                            one or two bases.” Wen I looked somewhat surprised at this proposal, he
                            hastened to add that if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            would not act along these lines, possibly Grivas could set him aside and
                            he could make the declaration. He added that he of course realized that
                            nothing like this could be done without US approval, tacit or otherwise.
                            I said that the proposal struck me as quite impracticable: in the first
                            place I understood that Cyprus was independent, and secondly, that I
                            could not imagine the Turks being willing to withdraw their contingent
                            from the island against some promise of future negotiations. I pointed
                            out that this was a far cry from the Acheson plan of last August and
                            that Turkey had even rejected that. Therefore, I did not believe this a
                            saleable proposition. I tried to probe to find out whether or not there
                            was something else the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> had
                            in mind, or whether some suggestion had been made to him by <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> or others about the possibility
                            of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> displacing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, but the results were
                            negative.</p>
                        <p>It appears possible, judging from other comments we have heard in recent
                            days, that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> may have been
                            entertaining thoughts of attempting a coup somewhat along these lines.
                            However, as we have reported, it does not appear that the Government has
                            been willing to go along with him. In recent talks with the Foreign
                            Minister, he has been categoric in asserting that Greece will take no
                            action to upset the present calm on the island.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> is a young man of good will sincerely troubled by
                            the political situation and eager to advance Greek interests. His
                            enthusiasm, his desire to be helpful, his inexperience and the fact that
                            he is naturally the target of many persons seeking to promote partisan
                            interest make it especially important to weigh with caution his
                            suggestions for action. Moreover, the narrower interest of the Crown as
                            well as the broader interest of Greek internal political stability
                            require that his initiatives be prudent and made only after mature
                            reflection. During the first year of his reign, he has, on balance,
                            handled himself with skill and with restraint. I shall continue to
                            encourage him to act in this manner.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> has had very interesting
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Latter
                            confirmed that Sov Chargé has made it very clear that if enosis is GOC
                            goal then “deal is off.” If enosis is declared and Turks move in as they
                            have threatened, then Sovs will stand aside; nor will they move if it is
                            obvious that Turks take action as result of GOC attack against Turk
                            Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> says <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> told Satouchin that he could
                            not specify GOC goals. Would appear that Sovs have indeed made clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that he cannot
                            count on them unless he prepared to deal enosis out of his future and
                            they have at same time made clear what we have suspected all along: that
                            they are quite pragmatic—as distinct from impression they made on
                            gullible Cypriots—and would not get involved in nasty situation
                            resulting from some GOC miscalculation.</p>
                        <p>There would seem to be no reason to doubt <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' statement to <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>. It confirms reports we have been getting and
                            sending on to Dept in recent days and although Greeks here only now and
                            then suffer from pragmatism, they and GOC must now realize that there is
                            real trouble ahead in their attempts to use <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and supposed “open-ended” Soviet backing to achieve
                            their aims. They may therefore be more amenable to negotiation than at
                            any time in recent months. We have suggested this in recent cables,<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3">These suggestions were made in telegrams 945
                                from Nicosia, January 26, 947 from Nicosia, January 27, and 953 from

                            dictation from Athens.</p>
                        <p>Which leads us to suggest that we should be very cautious indeed in
                            proposing some new set of negotiations or talks (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 495) between Greece and Turkey
                            without being prepared to accept that the results may be abortive as the
                            last time we did so. There is nothing that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would like better than to have a chance now to
                            burnish his somewhat, but not seriously, tarnished image a bit by
                            appearing the super patriot again, as he did when he rejected Acheson
                            Plan mark one once it was presented to him by Papandreou. In fact right
                            now he needs another such chance in order to counter criticism that he
                            had become too involved with the Soviets. As we have suggested,
                                GOC-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> appear boxed
                            in, and we should be careful not to give them opportunity get out.</p>
                        <p>We continue to believe that the time is ripe for some new initiative,
                            whether or not along the lines of our suggestions, and that <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> is our <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0394"/>best bet, despite real or imagined
                            unhappiness on part of Turks with him (which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might do something to counter). We are convinced
                            however that no new game will be productive that deals <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> out of the first hand. He is
                            in charge here and he has made it unmistakably clear that there are no
                            “parties concerned” with the internal problem as far as he is concerned,
                            except the people of Cyprus, consisting of a Greek majority and a Turk
                            minority. This position has international appeal and from viewpoint US
                            interests whether he has the right to feel this way is immaterial: he is
                            in a position to sabotage any bilateral agreement reached between Greece
                            and Turkey and emerge stronger domestically than ever before, as he did
                            after the last time he was dealt out of the game. Had we not better
                            promote the <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>
                            position—i.e., <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> talks to line up a possible
                            mutually acceptable position which might then be negotiated by GOC and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, or by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Our own
                            feeling is that interests of settlement would be better served by direct
                            negotiations between <hi rend="italic">Makarios</hi> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Trouble with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> handling joint position for GOC–<gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is that latter will always be vulnerable to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if he thinks <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is moving in wrong direction to
                            detriment of Cyprus or if he sees some personal advantage in pulling
                            rug. On other hand direct GOC–<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            negotiations based on joint GOC–<gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            position would seem to have effect of multiplying pressures on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> while giving him important
                            psychological (and political) incentive of appearing to be master of own
                            fate.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister called on the Acting Secretary at his own request in
                            order to exchange views on the Cyprus problem before his departure for
                            Nicosia next week. During the hour long conversation, the following
                            points emerged:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Prospects for the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> expressed pessimism over
                            prospects for the General Assembly. The Acting Secretary agreed that the
                            chances for the General Assembly are not good, that it is likely to
                            adjourn on or about Monday February 8, and that the adjournment may be
                            for several weeks.<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2">The General Assembly
                                recessed on February 8.</note> He inquired about the plans of the
                            Government of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister noted that the Government of Cyprus has been hoping
                            for a General Assembly debate to strengthen its positions and that of
                            the Mediator. With the likelihood of an adjournment, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> felt that it is now necessary
                            for him to return to Cyprus for consultations.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">United States Position.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> asked how the United
                            States feels now about the Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary stated that there is no change in the United States
                            position. The United States, he noted, has always hoped for a resolution
                            of the problem through discussions. A solution cannot be reached
                            otherwise. The United States has long been skeptical that the General
                            Assembly debate would make a contribution to the settlement. The United
                            States position regarding a settlement is the same, that the parties
                            must work out a settlement themselves. We are not prepared to dictate
                            the solution. We tried to help in Geneva and it did not work. We have no
                            plans and no proposals.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister rephrased his question, asking what, after the
                            experiences of the past year, the United States sees as a solution.
                            Negotiations, he stated, have been tried and failed and would be of no
                            use now unless there were some hope for a settlement.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that no talks
                            have been tried since last year in January in London, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that negotiations have
                            been repeatedly tried over many years. But what, he pressed, is the
                            United States view of a solution? The positions of the parties concerned
                            are well known: the Turks favor federation; Cyprus wants unfettered
                            independence, majority rule, and self-determination. Cyprus knows, he
                            said, that the United States wants an agreed solution but does the
                            United States have some advice on a solution?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> observed that he could
                            only tell the Foreign Minister what he had told <persName corresp="#p_EFC1">Erkin</persName>. The treaties are still on the
                            books. No one denies that they are not very workable. When this is the
                            case, the only thing to do is to <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0396"/>get together and talk. We told Turkey that we have no solution.
                            Furthermore, a United States solution would not be useful. Because of
                            the power and size of the United States, even if we made a proposal it
                            would be taken as an attempt to coerce the parties concerned; so we
                            refuse to make such a proposal. When we asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> to offer advice to the
                            Mediator, he was acting as an individual who put forward ideas which
                            were not United States positions but were intended to move the parties
                            toward agreement. He served as a catalyst. However, the effort did not
                            work and is now academic. At present, there is nothing we can contribute
                            by choosing a solution. On the contrary, we would be doing a
                            disservice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> stated that another
                            facet is also important: countries which have made clear their views on
                            a solution all have a direct national interest in the matter: the Greeks
                            want enosis, the Soviets oppose enosis, the Turks want federation, etc.
                            However, the United States by the nature of things is not directly
                            concerned with any particular solution. We do not support enosis, nor do
                            we condemn it. We do not support federation, nor do we condemn it. We
                            want only to have peace and stability in the area.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister insisted that there must, however, be a lasting
                            solution. In order for it to be lasting, it must be acceptable to the
                            majority of the Cyprus population. The majority does not want
                            federation. Even a considerable number of Turk-Cypriots do not want to
                            divide the island. But to say that all the parties concerned have a veto
                            means that no solution is possible. In this context, the United States
                            should press for the right solution. The United States cannot take a
                            stand contrary to its principles. Others may do so, but not the United
                            States. The situation only becomes more and more dangerous when the
                            belief is accepted that the various parties have a veto. Turkey, for
                            example, is not hurting because of the dispute. Neither for that matter
                            is Greece. Therefore, they can afford to carry on and, as long as Turkey
                            holds to its present course, no solution is possible.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Soviet Position.</hi>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that it is wrong to
                            believe that the Soviet position against enosis will make the Greeks or
                            Greek-Cypriots anti-Soviet. They will instead again think it is the
                            fault of the United States for not taking a firm stand. He asked why the
                            United States is quiet over Turkey's approaches to the Soviet Union.
                            When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> pointed out that
                            the United States did not object when the Government of Cyprus
                            approached the Soviets, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            maintained that the Government of Cyprus quickly learned of the United
                            States attitude through the American press. He said that, by contrast,
                            even when Turkey withdrew from the <gloss target="#t_MLF1">MLF</gloss>,
                            there was no United States criticism. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> pointed out that the change in Turk relations
                            with the Soviets amounted to no more than a slight rapprochement to
                            which the United States could not object.</p>
                        <pb n="359" xml:id="pg_359" facs="0397"/>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the danger in this development is that it
                            may lead to a competition between Turkey and Cyprus concerning the
                            Soviets. If the tendency is to make the Soviets central to the dispute,
                            each party may attempt to bid higher for Soviet support. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said there is no doubt that the
                            Government of Turkey is willing to play up any kind of support it can
                            get. However, he noted, the Turk-Soviet conversations, as the United
                            States sees them, are not very far-reaching. We were surprised, in fact,
                            at the Soviet statement regarding federation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> reiterated that the
                            development is not a major element and expressed its primary importance
                            as giving somewhat more encouragement to the Turks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated his belief that
                            the Soviet position is simple. Moscow, he felt, supports the Government
                            of Cyprus up to the point of enosis. If the Government of Cyprus says
                            that it abandons enosis as an objective, the Soviets would be 100% on
                            the Government of Cyprus side. Only here do Soviet interests coincide
                            with Turkey's.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Turkish Objectives.</hi> The Foreign Minister
                            maintained that in the long run it is not even in Turkey's interest to
                            forget enosis. At present, he said, the Turks oppose everything Cyprus
                            wants, but their basic interests would not prohibit enosis. He then
                            professed to be puzzled as to Turkey's aims. He insisted that the
                            Government of Cyprus really does not know, even though the Turks talk
                            about federation and partition.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary suggested that the Government of Cyprus ask them.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> hurriedly stated
                            that the Mediator has been asking and cannot find out. He asked if it
                            were prestige the Turks wanted, or land. He opined that the Turks know
                            it is not possible to partition the island. He said that minority
                            safeguards through the United Nations could be accepted in the
                            Government of Cyprus. As far as East-West relations are concerned,
                            Cyprus will choose enosis through self-determination and enosis will
                            solve all problems. Therefore, he concluded, it is difficult to know
                            what else Turkey could want.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> stated that, in a
                            situation such as this, many deep emotional feelings, some rational,
                            some not, are involved. Pride comes into the picture, national prestige,
                            concern for the Turk-Cypriots, etc. It is very difficult to say that,
                            objectively, the best interests of Turkey or Greece or Cyprus lie in a
                            particular formula; this has been tried but is not what the parties
                            concerned find acceptable. As far as Turkey's desires are concerned, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that much
                            depends on the manner in which a solution is worked out. Turkey might
                            accept solution “A” at one time and not at another. He noted that, once
                            last summer, there was a moment when it appeared Turkey might accept
                            mere tokens to save its prestige, involving the lease of a small bit of
                            land for a base, coupled with enosis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said that he believes there is currently an
                            enormous desire in <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0398"/>Turkey to
                            get rid of this problem. It has been here a long time and has become a
                            domestic liability for the Government of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Talks between the parties.</hi> The Acting Secretary
                            expressed the view that a quiet kind of conversation over a long period
                            of time would be useful. He noted that talks could perhaps involve
                            Cyprus, Greece and Turkey with someone from the Turk-Cypriot community
                            and suggested that it would be far better to enter into discussions than
                            to let the situation continue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> added that discussions should involve some kind
                            of quiet contacts perhaps between the Government of Cyprus and the
                            Government of Turkey, and should be secret bargaining sessions to
                            discover if the first positions of the parties are final.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> expressed the opinion
                            that Turkey's first position is not final. He argued that an undertaking
                            to hold discussions would in itself be useful, even if it fails. Such
                            discussions, he pointed out, should not be gone through quickly, and in
                            the meantime it would help for reasonable stability to continue on the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister contended that the Turk-Cypriots have been building
                            their strength during this period of calm. The Acting Secretary
                            responded that some new tensions have arisen and mentioned specifically
                            President Makarios' election proposal and the upcoming Turkish
                            contingent troop rotation problem. These, he said, could make the
                            situation very rough, but nevertheless talks could be quietly entered
                            into and quietly held between Cyprus and Turkey, or among Cyprus, Turkey
                            and Greece.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> criticized the
                            London-Zurich agreement and suggested that a real solution is one which
                            will enable the Greek-Cypriots and Turk-Cypriots to live together. He
                            argued that divisiveness must not be insisted on and predicted that, if
                            Turkey does insist, again there will be trouble. Federation, he said, is
                            all right in a situation where it is necessary to bring parts together
                            into a whole, but in Cyprus federation would mean breaking up that which
                            is already whole.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary reiterated that the United States is not insisting
                            on any particular solution, federation or otherwise, but feels that
                            since the island is quiet now, this is a chance for profitable talks;
                            they hold the only hope. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> suggested that the Government of Cyprus might
                            find a basis for satisfying the Turks without physical separation.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> agreed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> suggested that such a
                            possibility should not be excluded. He reiterated his thought that in a
                            quiet atmosphere, over a period of time, Turkey might not stick to its
                            original position. However, he stated, outsiders should stay out,
                            including even the British. The Soviets should stay out as well, he
                            added, and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> noted that the
                            attitude of all the parties has changed in the last few months; it is
                            now clear that anything which is acceptable to <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0399"/>Turkey and to the Greek-Cypriots would
                            be acceptable to everyone else. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> objected that some differences between Turkey
                            and the Turk-Cypriots are now apparent. He expressed the opinion that it
                            would be helpful if agreement could be reached between Greece, Turkey
                            and the United Kingdom to approve whatever the Greek-Cypriots and
                            Turk-Cypriots would work out. Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> expressed strong doubts that either Turkey or
                            the Turk-Cypriots would agree to such an arrangement; Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> added that, if the Government
                            of Cyprus worked something out with the Turk-Cypriots, Turkey might
                            possibly accept it after some study.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> emphasized that his
                            advice to the Foreign Minister about entering into talks he had already
                            given to the Turkish Government and that he would willingly give it to
                            the Greek Government. The Foreign Minister stated that the Government of
                            Cyprus' fear has always been and still is that it cannot get a lasting
                            and proper solution if a country outside Cyprus has a veto. He termed
                            this “always a mistake”. During negotiations back in the 1950's, he
                            contended, the matter could have remained a colonial issue but the
                            United Kingdom brought in Greece and Turkey. Cyprus, he said, is now
                            trying to overcome that mistake. The Government of Cyprus feels that if
                            a solution were definitely in sight, it would welcome negotiations.
                            However, it has reservations about abandoning principles when it knows
                            that negotiations will fail.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary reiterated that the only way to find out is to try.
                            He stated that if one tries to solve the problem on the basis of
                            abstractions, opposing abstractions cancel each other out. A good deal
                            of pragmatism, he suggested, is the best approach; the best way to find
                            a solution is to look for one and the best way to look for one is to
                            talk.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Mediator.</hi> The Foreign Minister remarked
                            rather wistfully that if the Mediator's preferred solution were only
                            known, talks might be more hopeful. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> expressed doubt that the Mediator is in as good a
                            position to look for a solution as the Government of Cyprus is. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> pointed out that the
                            Mediator working alone could be caught between strongly opposing
                            positions, shuttling back and forth between the parties; under such
                            circumstances, the talks might die. It would be better, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> added, if the Government of
                            Cyprus and the Turks talked together.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary suggested further that the Mediator might be most
                            useful if Cyprus and Turkey and Greece had representatives located
                            somewhere with the Mediator on hand to help.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Situation on the island.</hi> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> noted that two issues have
                            revived tensions on the island, the Turk contingent rotation and the
                            problem of another Red Crescent shipment. He expressed the view that the
                            negative attitude of the Government of Cyprus on these matters could
                            destroy the present relative calm. He questioned very seriously if this
                                <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0400"/>Government of Cyprus action
                            is worthwhile. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> described
                            the second issue as a relatively minor one. The Government of Cyprus, he
                            noted, has allowed all previous Red Crescent shipments in free even
                            though everything in them was available on the island and Cypriot
                            merchants were angry with the Government. As a result of Government of
                            Cyprus leniency, this is tending to become an established practice. But
                            with regard to the issue of the rotation, he said, a question of
                            principle is involved. The Government of Cyprus questions the very
                            presence of the contingent. The last time the Government of Cyprus
                            agreed not to oppose rotation, it turned out that the Turks sent out 500
                            Turk-Cypriot students and brought in 500 Turkish soldiers. When Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> objected that there
                            was United Nations supervision of the last rotation, the Foreign
                            Minister insisted that the United Nations could not possibly tell
                            whether or not such a thing happened. The Government of Cyprus, however,
                            knows it as a fact and it makes the problem very difficult. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> suggested a
                            pragmatic view that even if true, it is a small matter compared to the
                            obstacle the Government of Cyprus refusal raises to a final
                            settlement.</p>

                            that this time he certain Turks not bluffing when they say failure to
                            rotate on time (by March 8) would require special legislation by Turk
                            GNA. (Perhaps Ankara could comment on this.)</p>

                        <p>Important question remains, however, whether Grivas will act according

                            Since Grivas' role or status on island has apparently never been clearly
                            defined, it is difficult to know how much control <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> actually has over him. Greek General
                            Staff members have always responded vaguely to our questions regarding
                            their relationship to Grivas and to his calls at Greek Pentagon. They
                            have emphasized, however, that he is individualistic, “stubborn mule
                            from Cyprus.” King Constantine has told me he understands Greek General
                            Staff can influence Grivas but that latter is not subject General
                            Staff's command. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>

                        <p>We recognize Grivas may be toying with idea of a coup d'etat to take
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> out of the play and
                            to create situation in which Cyprus Government would be actively
                            pro-enosis and anti-Communist; such coup might put Papandreou in
                            extremely awkward position domestically if Grivas were publicly to offer
                            enosis and Papandreou were not in a position to respond for fear of
                            Turkish reaction. There is also reason to suspect that Grivas actually
                            proposed during his Athens visit that Makarios be set aside and was
                            disappointed by what he considered to be lack of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> policy on the Cyprus issue. Greek sources have been
                            very discreet about Grivas' talks here. However, the King and today the
                            Foreign Minister (contradicting his previous statement) told me General
                            Staff making available some additional officers to Grivas to enable him
                            strengthen command of Cyprus National Guard.</p>
                        <p>2. Cypriot elections and Turkish rotation</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> informed me that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> was unaware of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' plan for new elections and
                            did not approve his statement on this subject. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> also confirmed to me today that
                            Papandreou had spoken sternly to <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> when he stopped here last week on return from
                            New York and had urged him to avoid any actions likely to aggravate
                            situation, and specifically, to refrain from holding elections,
                            proclaiming new Constitution, and preventing rotation of Turkish force.
                            Re latter, Costopoulos told me he suggested to Turk Charge that rotation
                            be under supervision <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> and that Turks had agreed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> hoped that, if Turks
                            delay rotation short while, there would be no snags. He also said
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> had agreed to try to
                            help in persuading Makarios against changes in Constitution and to
                            permit rotation.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> views on interim solution</p>
                        <p>To your question whether <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> appreciates
                            problem of readjusting and adapting itself to prolongation of status
                            quo, I think the answer is qualified yes. Soviet-Turkish rapprochement
                            and postponement of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debate have
                            helped to make Greeks realize that unconditional enosis is out of
                            question, although they still call for unfettered independence with
                            right of self-determination. In these circumstances, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> policy is to play for time, to avoid
                            any incidents on island, and to await outcome of <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s efforts. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> this morning expressed
                            opinion that Mediator's position was even more important in view
                            postponement of <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. He observed,
                            however, that when filed, his report would probably satisfy no one.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> also expressed
                            hope <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> would not file a final
                            report in March, but would keep door open by simply submitting brief
                            “temporary” report stating he had been unable find agreed solution and
                            would be available for further talks. He will urge this on Plaza when he
                            comes to Athens tomorrow and he believes <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> may be willing extend his mediation efforts for
                            some time to come. (This may <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0404"/>well be wishful thinking.) Finally <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> noted that there was little prospect of
                            reaching agreed solution while political situation in Turkey in flux and
                            until after Turk elections.</p>
                        <p>If Mediator, however, eventually outlined general plan for interim
                            solution to problem and suggested talks, I think Greeks would find this
                            face-saving way to get off hook of no negotiations—providing <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s recommendations did not rule
                            out enosis at some future date. There are, I believe, elements in <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that may still be considering whether
                            current situation might permit a new effort to find solution roughly
                            along lines of August 20 Acheson formula, although Karpas area would
                            probably not be acceptable as leased base area. More and more Greeks
                            realize they must break out of current impasse, and Papandreou himself,
                            I believe, knows continuation of tension and uncertainty is heavy drain
                            on Greek economic resources and also potential threat to longevity of
                            his government.<note n="7" xml:id="d177fn7">In telegram 1217 from
                                Athens, February 13, the Embassy reported information that
                                Papandreou believed the Cyprus issue had entered a new phase.

                        </p>
                        <p>If some kind of interim arrangement must be made for an independent,
                            demilitarized Cyprus, Papandreou will probably prefer that
                            responsibility fall on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> conduct the
                            negotiations. (This factor also explains in part <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' reluctance to talk to
                            Turks.) In such an event, however, Papandreou will be increasingly
                            vulnerable to attacks from the opposition asserting that he did not
                            avail himself of his opportunities to assert his control over <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and to attempt to achieve at
                            least a conditional enosis (subject to base rights, etc.).</p>
                        <p>In final analysis, what Papandreou could not accept, nor could any Greek
                            leader, would be an agreement permanently forbidding enosis. In this
                            respect, I believe the Greek position coincides with ours, i.e., enosis
                            is the only solution which appears to hold out hope for lasting
                            stability in the area.</p>

                            British Embassy Counselor Trench Feb 24 apparent divergencies in US and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> attitude re Mediator's plans and
                            nature of his proposed report. Following points were made to Trench:</p>
                        <p>1. Turks have pressed us several times to agree that Plaza should not
                            submit report with recommendations; we committed ourselves to Turks to
                            discourage submission of report.</p>
                        <p>2. Greeks also hold view that report would not be useful at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>3. We understood as of our last talks with British on subject in December
                            that they also opposed submission substantive report.</p>
                        <p>4. Now, however, Plaza seems determined to submit report with
                            recommendations which apparently weighted heavily in favor Greek Cypriot
                            views.</p>
                        <p>5. We deeply concerned since we feel Turk reaction to such report may be
                            dangerous.</p>
                        <p>6. We note at same time that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US
                            views appear to be diverging; we concerned over differing UK–US
                            assessments of <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s tactics
                            and wish call to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>'s attention.</p>
                        <p>7. We feel that <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> may be
                            giving <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> one idea and US another as to
                            what report would look like.</p>
                        <p>8. We also feel that among elements in <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s proposed solution, he is talking about
                            demilitarization of island and not Republic; this appears to be one of
                            matters which he may be making different noises about to <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and US.</p>
                        <p>9. We feel British should take measures to clarify <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s views on report before he
                            commits himself to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            leaves Nicosia to return to New York.</p>

                        <p>We queried Trench as to British attitude toward submission substantive
                            report by mediator. Trench said he had little guidance on this but
                            quoted from telegram on <gloss target="#t_FonSec1">FonSec</gloss>
                            Stewart's statement to Greek and Turk Ambassadors, and Bottomley's
                            statement to Cyprus <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>er, on Feb 19
                                (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5269 to London) urging
                            that parties exercise maximum restraint pending submission of mediator's
                            report next month. Stewart's statement as read by Trench indicated
                            British hope that Plaza report might contain new elements which could
                            help toward settlement. Trench also stated that Cypriot <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>er London had asked Bottomley
                            whether British favored talks among parties. Bottomley had replied by
                            letter to effect talks might be more meaningful after mediator's report
                            submitted. From this it seems clear British at least reconciled to, if
                            not in agreement on, submission report with recommendations for
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Trench said he would report conversation to London and give us HMG
                            reaction when received. We hope this reaction will throw light on
                            British thinking re wisdom of public report by mediator.<note n="3" xml:id="d178fn3">In telegram 4203 from London, March 2, the Embassy

                        <p>Under Secretary remarked Aide-mémoire raised more questions than it
                            answered. Several facts were obscure: for example who has been training
                            in Alexandria and for how long. Our information indicated Greek officers
                            had been sent in February. If training is completed in one month rather
                            than three, it can only mean personnel were previously trained in Nike
                            missiles. Whether personnel “released” or not, they had residual
                            allegiance to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> or Greek military and
                            Greece had obligation to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.

                            island by injection into defense apparatus of some 13,000 personnel,
                            some of whom had been released from Greek services, and pointed out our
                            tacit acceptance of this situation was predicated on assumption <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could control situation, both

                            well as such problems as rotation of Turk contingent. Importation of
                            heavy hardware created provocatory situation. We do not know what
                            Turkish reaction will be. <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> has reported to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that some of missile equipment had arrived on island and

                            simple. Situation has worsened. If there are advantages in having Greek
                            forces engaged in Cyprus can we expect <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to assume responsibility for maintenance of order and

                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> pointed out we have
                            concerns at different levels, but related: (1) question military and
                            intelligence people are asking—whether Greek forces sent to work with
                            Soviets or Egyptians had been trained or had intelligence of Nike
                            missiles since contacts brought about might provide <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0408"/>opportunity for Soviets to acquire
                            information on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces or missile
                            operations of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>; and 2) our
                            assumption that if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military
                            personnel, even though released, but subject to residual authority of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> government, come into contact
                            with highly sophisticated Soviet equipment, government concerned would
                            discuss this with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> engaged in form and substance
                            arguments. It was finally agreed form might not be violated if personnel
                            released from service but matter of substance still important since
                            training on Soviet equipment provided opportunities for obtaining some
                            knowledge of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> equipment. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> comprehended security aspect and
                            promised to seek further explanation. He rephrased problem as need for
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to persuade <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> whatever Greece has done has not been
                            harmful to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interests. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> repeated we are not
                            concerned with form but with larger considerations—that Greek personnel
                            presumably owe allegiance to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, in
                            position of operating Soviet equipment, with Soviet training, and this
                            should be formally reported to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> raised question of effect
                            of recent shipments of heavy equipment on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting March 17 and extension of mandate of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>. He noted that in past SYG has
                            taken position sovereign nation has right to import arms for self
                            defense but these heavy arms raise question whether action is in
                            accordance with earlier resolution. We do not know what difficulties
                            this will cause for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting or who
                            would be charged with responsibility. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could
                            not be charged since it had not told GOC to buy arms and had not been
                            able to prevent. There was no consensus on what might develop in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as result recent shipments.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary said we have been trying with enormous effort to bring
                            about some kind of settlement of this perpetual turmoil at some cost to
                            our interests since role of peacemaker is never easy. He supported Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>'s statement of
                            difficulties new situation has placed in way of progress toward
                            settlement and correctness of our assumption that in light of our
                            involvement so far we were entitled to more candor in connection with
                            buildup than had been case.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> asked for examples of what
                            might be done to put situation in perspective. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied with statement of some
                            possible immediate steps: 1) arrange avoid having missiles emplaced, if
                            erected put under control of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, and 2) further deliveries of heavy equipment, such as
                            100 mm. guns, stopped; 3) rotation, that it take place without
                            conditions in accordance with assurances we understand have been given.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> did not have degree of control to stop
                            deliveries, noting it would have had chance had there been no aerial
                            aggression or no Turkish threat. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> noted that provocative nature of this equipment is
                            the real question, together with effect it has had on Archbishop's
                            position, causing him to take harder, more inflexible line. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> said putting weapons under
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control would certainly be
                            resisted by GOC and <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0409"/>would
                            require change in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mandate. Under
                            Secretary said it was matter of speech. They need not be controlled,
                            they could be neutralized under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> queried whether there was
                            any indication yet of Turkish reaction. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied we had no idea, but there are number of
                            reasons for avoiding stirring up Turks when we should be working to
                            bring about settlement. He noted we had been encouraged by indication
                            GOG in congratulating new Turkish <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had hinted willingness to talk. <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> referred to Mediator's report,
                            surmised it would contain suggestions for formal conference or other
                            less formal way of consultations to move toward settlement and asked
                            whether <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> knew conclusions of
                            Mediator. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> replied in

                        <p>Conversation concluded with Under Secretary's noting we would await more
                            information from <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> indicated he would

                            pointed out, we have spent enormous effort to improve chances for

                            Realistically we must analyze obstacles to negotiations brought about by

                        <p>1364. I called last night on <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            Papandreou at his home in Kastri together with <persName corresp="#p_AN1">Anschuetz</persName>. The <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was in serious, almost grim, mood
                            and seemed rather tired.</p>
                        <p>I immediately launched into discussion of Cyprus question and covered
                            substantially same ground covered by <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>
                            yesterday with <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 1161).<note n="2" xml:id="d180fn2">
                                <ref target="#d179">Document 179</ref>.</note> I said that although
                            during latter part of February and first days of March, situation had
                            seemed to be improving on island (for which I credited Papandreou's
                            influence on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            Grivas). In recent days things had taken serious turn for worse. There
                            seemed to be two elements in this. First, increasingly hard line taken
                            by Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, as
                            indicated by his restrictions on Turkish population, his refusal to
                            cooperate with <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> to reduce
                            tensions in Famagusta, and his reported statement that his “peace
                            offensive” had not yielded results with implication that therefore
                            Archbishop would have to assume tougher line. Second aspect was
                            introduction of Soviet heavy equipment including surface-to-air missiles
                            into island, manned by Greeks trained in UAR. I pointed out introduction
                            these missiles could be “straw that broke camel's back” with regard to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, taking into <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0411"/>account steady erosion Turk position as
                            result Makarios policy of “faits accomplis.” <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had been shocked that loyal <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ally, Greece, without informing US or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, permitted its citizens to be trained
                            in Soviet weapons. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> viewed this
                            development with gravest concern, and we request <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to exert all its influence on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> immediately to stop any
                            further deliveries of SAMs and to seek means to dispose of or neutralize
                            arms already delivered.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou first commented on “unacceptable” manner in which matter had
                            been presented to <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName>. He said
                            he realized Cyprus problem could involve question of war and peace
                            between Greece and Turkey and possibly consequent escalation into
                            confrontation between blocs. He reiterated that US had no more loyal
                            ally than Greece and spoke with sincere regret of fact there had been
                            series of misunderstandings between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> since he had come to power. He
                            referred specifically to his inability to accept President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s suggestion for direct talks
                            with Inonu. Failure <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to take position
                            on merits of Cyprus problem had unhappily permitted Moscow to inject
                            itself dangerously into situation. His own invitation to Moscow was part
                            Soviet disruptive policy. Although he had accepted invitation to Moscow
                            he had interposed conditions with regard to timing and diplomatic
                            preparation which would never be met. Internal divisions within country
                            make it impossible for him to leave at this time and inasmuch as Soviet
                            Union would never accept self-determination and enosis for Cyprus,
                            diplomatic condition precedent for visit to Moscow will never be
                            fulfilled. Reflecting obvious sensitivity to unfavorable reaction which
                            might be created by his current domestic policy toward left, he
                            reiterated his uncompromising opposition to Communism as well as his
                            dedication to use of democratic measures to combat it. These measures he
                            insisted require time and organization, but democratic approach is only
                            one which holds ultimate hope for success.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then reverted to question SAMs
                            and asserted delivery of SAMs do not constitute threat to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> because they can be used only against
                            aircraft and only in event of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> aerial
                            attack on Cyprus. Papandreou noted that last August Turks had been able
                            to bomb island with impunity and that Cypriot Govt had legitimate right
                            to seek defensive weapons. He observed it is much better that these
                            missiles be in hands of Greeks, and not Russians, and thus could be
                            controlled. He asked if I would prefer to have Russians man these
                            weapons. In apparent effort vindicate participation Greeks, Papandreou
                            noted that as result of training in use of SAMs, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> now in possession of considerable technical data on
                            these Soviet weapons which it would turn over to US. I noted <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had not been informed by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that it is in possession of such data
                            but that we would welcome receipt of it. However, price is much too high
                                <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0412"/>and we would prefer not
                            have secrets than see Greek soldiers trained by Soviets and Soviet
                            missiles introduced into Cyprus.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou then turned to what he described as <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s “threatening attitude.” He asserted Turks are
                            constantly threatening to bomb Cyprus which in turn justified Cypriots
                            to seek defensive weapons. When I asked him provide instances such
                            threats, he answered that aside from frequent declarations of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> military figures, British MP Francis
                                Noel-<persName corresp="#p_BJ1">Baker</persName>, who had seen
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> one morning last week, had
                            informed him that <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> had admitted that he
                            could not control Turkish military which boasted that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> Air Force needed only “seven minutes”
                            to be over target on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> continued that in view of
                            these circumstances he could not logically tell Makarios to give up his
                            defenses. It would be “illogical” for him to tell GOC that they must
                            disarm themselves and only “pray” against Turkish attack. Papandreou
                            then returned to his favorite theme, which he has repeated to me many
                            times (cf. <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 314 August 16,
                                1964)<note n="3" xml:id="d180fn3">Not printed. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, POL 27 CYP)</note> throughout Cyprus crisis: if US
                            would only issue warning to both <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> against any military
                            intervention in Cyprus, then he could assure US that there would be no
                            further troubles on island itself. He himself could go there to
                            establish <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> control over situation.
                            PriMin spoke at some length on advantages to be gained from such
                            “guarantee”.</p>
                        <p>I answered that if <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> unwilling to give
                            such pledge throughout past year it is most improbable that events now
                            would induce them to do so. I contrasted Cypriot acquiring of SAMs as
                            means to deter <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> attack to person who
                            gets inoculation against disease only to find that inoculation itself
                            provokes the disease. I stressed that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could consider <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' actions as attempted blackmail to which they
                            would not submit, since <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> continues
                            adhere their own interpretation of their rights under treaties.</p>
                        <p>I told Papandreou we would like certain specific information, which Under
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> had requested of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> and I had requested of
                            Garoufalias, concerning arrangements made with UAR and/or USSR
                            concerning training of Greeks to operate SAMs, number of SAMs, etc.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> note (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1359)<note n="4" xml:id="d180fn4">
                                <ref target="#d179fn4">See footnote 4, Document 179</ref>.</note>
                            had not been responsive in this regard. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> replied somewhat indignantly that as <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> note had stated, there were no
                            agreements between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and UAR or USSR;
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said individuals involved
                            were all retired personnel who had joined Cyprus forces of own accord.
                            In fact he had only learned there were Greek personnel involved when
                            present question arose. I noted I had been informed that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had recalled from US all those Greek
                            technicians being trained in <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0413"/>operation Nike-Hercules missiles in US immediately after completion of
                            training instead of permitting them spend some extra time in US as has
                            been custom. This led some observers surmise they might be recalled to
                            replace those learning to operate Soviet SAMs. I added that I would like
                            to discuss all of these aspects with DefMin Garoufalias. Papandreou said
                            he would give DefMin instructions to supply me with all information I
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>I then posed question to Papandreou as to what specific measures <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could take re SAMs. Papandreou
                            countered he was more than willing make every effort reduce tension but
                            that it must be “joint effort.” Therefore, he said, he would use all of
                            his influence with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and
                            Grivas to prevent any further shipments of SAMs if US and/or <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> agreed to give guarantee against any
                            future Turkish aerial attack on Cyprus except in case of serious
                            provocation. He noted Grivas was coming to Athens and he would tell
                            Grivas that he must obey instructions to refrain from aggressive actions
                            and if he would not do that, he must resign.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out such <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> guarantee was
                            highly unlikely. Consequently, question is whether <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> would make necessary effort
                            without this assurance. Reluctantly, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said he would do all he could, even in absence of
                            such guarantees. However, he concluded that he would be counselling
                            “illogical” course, since he was asking <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to be “defenseless” in event of possible
                            Turkish attacks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AN1">Anschuetz</persName> asked if <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> considered present situation
                            might not be suitable moment to initiate direct <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> talks. Papandreou
                            said policy of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is to not take any
                            initiative prior to submission Mediator's report. He remains firmly
                            attached to policy of maintaining peace on island pending eventual
                            solution and says he will do all in power to that end.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Although interview was discouraging, I
                            believe Papandreou and his govt will make sincere efforts to prevent
                            escalation and, given some cooperation from Turkish side, to reduce
                            tensions. Last night Papandreou limited himself to general assurances
                            and provided no concrete commitments or precise information. Papandreou,
                            of course, attempted to bargain for cessation of shipments of Soviet
                            anti-aircraft missiles to Cyprus and apparently saw controversy over
                            SAMs as opportunity to present his favorite proposal for US “guarantee”
                            that there be no outside military intervention in Cyprus. When he saw
                            this was not possible, he agreed to exert his efforts to stop any
                            further shipments, although it remains to be seen whether he can
                            actually produce on this. His argument that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Cypriots may not be willing to follow his
                            advice on this “illogical” line seems to me quite possible. Leaving
                            Soviet equipment, emphasis on defensive nature of the missiles will have
                            popular appeal here and on the island.</p>
                        <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0414"/>
                        <p>Although I feel that Papandreou and others with whom we have talked have
                            come to realize very serious aspect of Greek involvement with Soviet
                            SAMs they obviously find themselves in most serious dilemma and are hard
                            put to work way out. Because of defensive nature of missiles and strong
                            position <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Grivas
                            will doubtless take for their installation, it will not be easy.
                            However, impotence of Papandreou's position, demonstrated once again,
                            derives from knowledge he cannot control <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> but must keep up pretense he is in control of
                            situation, from his fear of taking a position which would compromise him
                            vis-à-vis public opinion in Cyprus or in Greece, and fact that
                            emotionally he is convinced Cyprus is justified in doing what it can to
                            defend itself, notwithstanding reservations about methods employed to do
                            so. On other hand, friction with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and
                            American public opinion deeply distresses him and he would sincerely
                            like to be responsive to US requests.</p>
                        <p>I wish to stress to Department and others in Washington that final
                            paragraph of Papandreou's reply to our démarche<note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">This paragraph stated that Greece had been and
                                continued to be a “sincere and faithful ally” while Turkey, which
                                had opened a “courtship” with the Soviet Union, had not attracted
                                “any allied criticism which seems to be reserved as a prize of the
                                steadfastness of Greece.” (Greek aide-mémoire, March 14; Department
                                of State, Central Files, POL 27 CYP)</note> is a sincere reflection
                            of Greek feeling. In spite of all we have told Greeks over many months,
                            they remain convinced that we pamper the Turks, reserving our
                            condemnation for the Greeks.</p>
                        <p>To set the record straight (see para number 5 of Papandreou reply) <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> did not tell me that
                            members of active Greek military were training in UAR. He referred to
                            “Greeks” or “Greek crews” as I recall. As <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> may be called to task for going even that
                            far and as he is undoubtedly very friendly to us, I made a point last
                            night in my talk with Papandreou of minimizing <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>' role as an informant. I
                            stated that I had gone to see the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> because of the rumors I had heard from other
                            sources; that, although the <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            had acknowledged missiles were possibly on the way and that “Greeks”
                            were training on them, he had not mentioned “regulars” but that we very
                            naturally assumed those Greeks had been trained on Nikes and were part
                            of Greece's armed services.</p>

                            interprets “guarantee” as some sort of assurance that the US will use

                            aggression and we could agree on meaning of “provocation”, it might be
                            possible to relieve Papandreou's worries somewhat on Turkish military
                            threat. If <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can prevent provocation,
                            we and the Greeks would have more influence with Turks. Could Papandreou

                            provocations for at least six month period, understanding this means:
                            Rotation of Turkish contingent without conditions; no customs or import

                            prevent incipient incidents and bring about more freedom of movement? If
                            Papandreou and other responsible elements of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> guarantee they could keep status “unprovoked”, we would
                            be in position to go to Turks and obtain clarification of their
                            assurances they will take no military action unless provoked and gain
                            their agreement on “provocation”. If you believe desirable you might

                            spotlighting problem, it would seem that effort might be made to seek

                            accomplishment by indirection.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> listened attentively and then
                            lowered boom—very hard.</p>
                        <p>Speaking from previously prepared notes he delivered himself as

                        <p>Time had come, he said, to stop talking of consulting parties and
                            exchanges of views. Have now reached stage where views and advice are
                            less than useful; situation much too serious. Determining factor is
                            situation on island. Weapons, officers and men have been introduced on
                            Cyprus allegedly for defense but actually for aggression against Turk
                            Cypriots. If Turks attacked island, these could be used against Turk
                            forces but real objective is Turk Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>Pointing to thick file of documents, <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said that they contained messages of type being
                            received daily describing dire plight of Turks on island. Also contained
                            in file were other messages from Washington, United Nations, etc.,
                            conveying repetitive message to effect “we are not able restrain
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>; you must be
                            patient”.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, as far as <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            concerned, its Commander admitted helplessness and only seemed be
                            thinking of how evade trouble if it breaks out.</p>

                        <p>In some unexplained way he seemed to think that some unidentified recent
                            talk which Dept officer <persName corresp="#p_CGT1">Churchill</persName>
                            had with unnamed officer of Turk Emb in Washington served confirm this

                        <p>As consequence, situation has been reached when <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> can no longer be satisfied with “appeals and talk”; it
                            must act. Turkish people believe their govt has left Turks in Cyprus to

                            regrettable” but Turkey has been left alone and isolated and time has
                            come when it felt it necessary act on its own.</p>
                        <p>As regards Soviets, they had brought some relief (by political support)
                            which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would prefer to have had come
                            from its allies. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> knows
                            that in US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, France, etc., there is
                            greater sympathy for Greece than Turkey. In so saying, <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> observed that he had served in
                            the United States, had liked Americans and had worked for and believed
                            in American-Turkish cooperation as Ambassador in Washington, but
                            unfortunately he does not see same understanding on part of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> now. It was hard say this but must be
                            frank.</p>
                        <p>There were many other angles of matter which might be discussed but
                            preferable stick to essentials. Only hope is to stop “inhuman acts” and
                            then negotiate.</p>
                        <p>With this said, he wanted to know what we are going to do. Were we going
                            to make new appeals? Would we again be heard saying we had tried and
                            failed? If we continue talk only in terms of advice, he saw no <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0418"/>possibility of restraining Turk
                            public and parties (Note: this somewhat elliptical but, like rest this
                            message, based on almost verbatim notes drafted in sequitur without
                            editing in order assure accuracy).</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said that same matter
                            would be discussed tomorrow with political party leaders, including
                            Inonu. On Monday Foreign Affairs Committees of both Houses would be
                            similarly consulted (in secret) and on Tuesday would be put before
                            Parliament in secret session. Thus far endorsement of policy has been
                            unanimous and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was confident
                            that would be same with parties and Parliament. After this process
                            completed Greek Govt would be officially informed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said foregoing was only
                            being divulged to us. He regretted news was not good but this was not
                            first time that situation faced which might result in war.</p>
                        <p>He concluded by saying that he had spoken with complete frankness. Still
                            possible that there might be last drop of that reasonableness for which
                            Greek ancestors known.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said there
                            were several questions which he wished pose for clarification:</p>
                        <p>When would Greeks be informed? Reply: Following conclusion of
                            consultations with parties and Parliament.</p>
                        <p>What kind of “inhuman acts” did <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            have in mind? Our most recent reports indicated no notable
                            deterioration. Reply: All kinds of harassments, economic restrictions,
                            inability move freely, “everything, everything”. For example, there were
                            some 40 items on list of things Turk-Cypriots were not allowed to
                            buy.</p>
                        <p>In saying that permission would not be asked for rotation, did that mean
                            would not even inform GOC? Reply: GOC will be informed but may be at
                            about same time rotation takes place. <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Galo</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> and U
                            Thant had arranged for rotation toward end of month and then it would
                            be.</p>
                        <p>How about awaiting <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report?
                            Reply: Turkish people are mocking government for what is regarded as
                            “wait and see” policy.</p>
                        <p>Not in form question but observation, <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> here said not correct to assert that friendship
                            in U.S. greater for Greece than Turkey. True that there are many more
                            Greeks in U.S. than Turks but Turkey greatly appreciated.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> also said that so-called
                            support of Turkey by Soviet Union was hardly impressive; seemed just be
                            lot of words with no commitment. We don't believe that Soviets really
                            want a solution; just playing game. We could do same thing but would be
                            harmful rather than helpful.</p>
                        <p>To this, <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> replied that he
                            was happy to hear these words of friendship for Turkey. As regards
                            Soviets, words may be vague but friends of Turkey not even prepared go
                            that far. What's more, believes Turks understand Russians very well and
                            we need have no reason for <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381" facs="0419"/>concern on that score. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>
                            said we did indeed understand this and it was for that reason that we
                            had not been perturbed despite insistence in certain quarters that we
                            should condemn <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> action to improve
                            relations with USSR.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> then said he had noted
                            that in my conversation with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            several days before, <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> had
                            spoken somewhat hopefully of talks with Greeks.<note n="5" xml:id="d182fn5">Reported in telegram 1355 from Ankara.</note> Could
                            not suggestion such talks be renewed in intended communication to
                            Greeks? Reply: Situation has changed. Furthermore Greeks didn't
                            reciprocate Turk indication of willingness talk (<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> didn't explain nature these
                            feelers but <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> later said he
                            probably referred specifically to talks with Greek named Drossos who
                            recently here in guise of newsman but was regarded as informal
                            emissary). Also situation deteriorating so fast that will be too late
                            for talks unless urgent action taken to redress situation. To this
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said he had
                            understood time would be given Greeks to take remedial action after
                            delivery of notice. <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said
                            this correct but time would be short.</p>
                        <p>Once again <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> asked what
                            would happen if Greeks prepared talk. <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said would wait while and see what happens but
                            made clear would not wait long. In any case, talks on basis enosis out
                            of question. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said he
                            felt sure <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would not insist on
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Finally, reverting to basics, <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said wished make clear that if <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should seek intervene again as it did
                            last year, results would be catastrophic for US-Turk relations. He
                            wished stress this. Turks are patient people but there comes a time when
                            they will act regardless of effect on mother, father, brother or son. It
                            is not question of talking about what Turks can do with Greeks but of
                            what U.S. can do. If we can do nothing, “events will follow their
                            natural course”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> asked what <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had in mind that we could do.
                                <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> said that was up to
                            State Dept.</p>
                        <p>At this rather conclusive point conversation was cut short by
                            announcement that Cabinet was assembled and awaiting <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>At one point in conversation, I said that woven into the remarks of
                                <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> I seemed to detect a
                            certain suggestion of what might be termed impatience with <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of rather serious sort. If so, I wished
                            recall that over the years and particularly since World War II U.S. and
                            Turkey had established fine record of mutual effort in building up
                            security strength of Turkey and also paving way for future development
                            of internal strength. Many Americans and many Turks had contributed in
                            this on basis of fundamental and enduring interests. Would be tragedy if
                            Cyprus, which totally unrelated to this mutual effort, should be allowed
                            affect basic relationship. Furthermore, in case of Cyprus itself, we had
                            made unusual <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0420"/>effort to be of
                            assistance and fact problem had proved so intractable should not be
                            charged unduly to us. As he had with Jernegan, Urguplu replied with
                            right words but that was all.</p>
                        <p>Comment: Any similarity between this conversation and that of my talk
                            with <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> of three days before
                            would be that of night and day, or, to put it another way, practically
                            all of the same points were covered in both conversations but in
                            mirror-like reverse. It would be reassuring to discount this as being
                            attributable to the temperamental reaction of an over-strained man such
                            as we sometimes saw in Erkin or in a display of super-gamesmanship at
                            which Inonu was adept, but this was seriously and ominously
                            different.</p>
                        <p>This was not a man speaking for himself with the authority of high
                            position but rather a man speaking under the impulsion of other forces
                            over which he can exert little control. This is not, of course, the
                            first crisis we have met in this wretched business but, serious as the
                            others were, this one disturbs me the most for the reason that it seems
                            to have developed a sudden head-long quality as distinct from previous
                            crises where there was always an Inonu at the wheel who could be
                            approached and could change course if he personally so decided.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> and I are having working

                            will see if we can find any rays of light in what is tonight very dark

                                a meeting in which Labouisse presented the proposals outlined in
                                telegrams 1179 and 1187 (<ref target="#d181fn3">see footnote 3,
                                    Document 181</ref>) to Athens. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, POL 27 CYP)</note> suggesting that if <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can give assurances that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can prevent provocations for at least six months, US
                            would be in a position to go to Turks and obtain clarification of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> assurance they will take no military
                            action unless provoked. Papandreou said that he could give assurances
                            “without reservations” to six month moratorium on provocation from Greek
                            side. He said he had just spoken to Grivas, who agreed in principle.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> and Alexandrakis
                            will leave for Cyprus this afternoon in effort to obtain agreement of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on this. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> emphasized that although he
                            agreed in principle with proposals, implementation must be completely
                            honest with “no hidden aspects.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then went point by point over
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>1. Rotation of Turkish forces. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            understands this to mean that no obstacles would be placed in face of
                            rotation of Turks. However, he emphasized that unit must be composed of
                            soldiers and must not constitute attempt to infiltrate Turkish officers.
                            I asked if in accepting rotation <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> meant that Greek side would not ask for exchange, or
                            try to bargain. He answered yes.</p>
                        <p>2. No customs or import restrictions on Red Crescent shipments. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said this unimportant matter and
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> completely in agreement on
                            condition that it be “honestly implemented.”</p>
                        <p>3. Economic blockade. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said this
                            also “logical and reasonable”.</p>
                        <p>4. More cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>.
                                <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> said of course.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> guarantee that so far as it was
                            within its power situation on island would remain “unprovoked.” <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> agreed but with understanding that GOC is independent
                            government. However, he assured me he would exert all possible influence
                            on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept this.</p>
                        <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> then said that US proposals had given
                            him “great satisfaction” and that ideas “correspond to what we believe.”
                            At same time he asked that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> exert all
                            its influence on <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to accept same
                            principles.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> that
                            Department's proposals were result of my meeting with him last Monday
                                (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1364)<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4">
                                <ref target="#d180">Document 180</ref>.</note> at which time he had
                            asked for guarantee against Turkish attack. I recalled that while I had
                            said a guarantee against military intervention was impossible, the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is proposing that if <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> can give assurances there will be
                            no provocation from Greek side for six months then we would be able to
                            use all our diplomatic power to obtain clarification and agreement from
                            Turks against intervention. PriMin answered that he considered it
                            essential to have harmonization of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> views, all other points being
                            minor and can be worked out. He said he was sending Garoufalias, who has
                            his complete confidence, to arrange matters with Grivas and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> wants
                            peace and he believes that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> does
                            also. However, he fears that misunderstanding could cause conflict. For
                            this reason he said this latest American initiative is
                            “praiseworthy.”</p>
                        <p>I then pointed out that proposals did not include certain points which
                            were so obvious as to not need mentioning, such as <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and GOC refraining from attack on
                            Turkish contingent or proclaiming instant enosis. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said “I give my guarantee on
                            this” at which time <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>
                            interjected “unless you request it.”</p>
                        <p>I said I wanted to be perfectly sure that we understood one another's
                            positions clearly. I said that it was my understanding that the <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> accepted completely the proposals
                            contained in Deptel 1179. He said yes, on condition that proposals be
                            “honestly applied.”</p>
                        <p>I asked then if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> accepted
                            proposals, to which <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> replied that that
                            is why he is sending <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>
                            to Nicosia. <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>
                            interjected that Grivas accepted proposals in principle although he
                            wanted clarification of some details, but there remained question of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and that he hoped
                            to have <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' answer when he
                            returned, probably on Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>I then brought up question of Ambelikou and asked if Grivas is willing to
                            accept <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> control of position. <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> answered that Grivas did not
                            accept this but had counterproposed that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces be stationed there together with GOC forces.
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> noted Grivas maintains it
                            was Turks who started trouble by building road and then moving in
                            platoon of troops. Therefore, Grivas insists that he remain in his
                            position there but that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force can join
                            him. Grivas is reluctant to turn position over to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> because he claims that Turks built road even though UN
                            was there. I pointed out that such a move by Grivas of turning over his
                            positions to <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0423"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would be example of good faith and
                            evidence of cooperation with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> that was
                            needed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> then spoke at some
                            length defending Grivas' position. He also asked us to inform Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> to ask <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> to be “more objective” re
                            situation. He said Grivas believed there was tendency in <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> of support for Turkish position
                            because of what they believed was their “underdog” status.</p>
                        <p>I asked for more details on what <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> told me yesterday about the Turks blocking the road
                            between Nicosia and Limassol.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> answered that Turks
                            had not actually blockaded road as yet but had constructed block houses
                            near it. I said Grivas should not take action on his own but should go
                            to see <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> even if
                            Turks move. He said Grivas would not take any initiative but it was
                            essential that <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> do
                            so. He said he would tell <persName corresp="#p_Thimayya1">Thimayya</persName> and Grivas when he saw them to try and settle
                            this and other questions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> asked me what I knew
                            about press reports of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> plans to
                            deliver ultimatum to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. I said I did
                            not know any details but I was aware that within <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> there are those advocating hard line and those
                            following more conciliatory policy. I said thing of most immediate
                            concern to Turks is the “inhuman treatment” of the Turkish Cypriots. For
                            that reason, every measure must be taken not to provide examples of
                            “inhuman treatment”. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said that
                            as far as he knew everyone was free to move on the island and that there
                            is no extreme hardship except for those in the Turkish created
                            pockets.</p>
                        <p>When I left Amb Alexandrakis accompanied us to door, and I emphasized
                            upon him once more necessity of avoiding incidents on island. I said
                            that the Greeks are in incomparably stronger position and should be able
                            to act with restraint toward any Turkish moves. Alexandrakis answered
                            that while it is true Greek Cypriots are in top position on island
                            itself, fact that Turkey is so close and constantly threatening attack
                            makes Greeks underdogs as far as overall situation concerned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Seriousness and importance with which
                            Greeks view our proposals was highlighted by fact that Prime Minister
                            had come into town on Sunday, contrary to custom, and had been holding
                            conferences all morning with Grivas and high <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> officials before seeing me. I believe Papandreou
                            genuinely pleased at Department's response which he considers is
                            obviously a step toward reduction of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            threat. Key question remains as to whether, assuming <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' acceptance in principle,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can enforce observance of
                            conditions. Another factor of prime importance is that Turks refrain
                            from sabre-rattling.</p>

                            possibility of war, tragic as it would be for Turks as well as Greeks,
                            cannot be excluded. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>
                            emphasized <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> considers <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> real interlocutor regarding Cyprus
                            problem and is therefore eager to initiate direct conversations with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> expressed appreciation
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName>'s presentation. As a
                            political leader himself he understood political and psychological
                            problems which confront <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Pending
                            final solution <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> attempting arrange
                            provisional solution based on maintenance of peace and status quo on
                            island which in turn would develop better climate between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. As result <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> initiative
                            GOC has been forced accept rotation, abandon economic blockade and
                            assure there will be no military provocations or operations. These
                            conditions were forced on GOC after threat of break by GOG. Papandreou
                            reverted to his basic argument that failure of bilateral talks would
                            only aggravate problem and again expressed regret he had not been able
                            accede last summer to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s request for direct talks.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou went on say that with submission Mediator's report period in
                            which talks inadvisable is drawing to an end. However, he was at loss
                            understand how Turks could justify such pressure for talks just on eve
                            of Mediator's report. Following submission Mediator's report new
                            discussions between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would be in order.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou noted <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> proposes avoid
                            talks with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. In fact,
                            Turkish Cypriots virtually do not exist as an effective economic or
                            intellectual factor on island while Greek Cypriots exist both in numbers
                                <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0425"/>and as a state. Turks
                            assert GOG has an army in Cyprus, which is true to an extent. Greek
                            military personnel were sent, however, to assist Cypriots who were faced
                            with threats from Turkey at a time when Cypriots themselves had
                            virtually no military resources and no control Makarios himself. Greek
                            assistance to Cyprus is purely for defense, but now Turks again threaten
                            because defense has been established. Some means must be found to break
                            out of this vicious circle. Although GOG has moral and material force to
                            impose its will if its demands are logical, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is morally strong when he is threatened with
                            attacks or with bombing. Since GOG has imposed its will on GOC to permit
                            rotation, etc., Turks must now also demonstrate good faith by refraining
                            from threats and thereby gain time to reach an understanding. War
                            between Greece and Turkey is improbable but cannot be excluded,
                            Papandreou said. If Turks want war they will have it because <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> cannot avoid it. However, he said, I am
                            determined there will be 1) no pretext for war or 2) no misunderstanding
                            which would constitute justification for war. War, if it comes, would
                            probably not be limited. Bulgaria might move under pretext of protecting
                            Greece while Tito would act to prevent Salonica from falling into hands
                            of Bulgarians. I do not want historical responsibility for a war, he
                            said, and I assure you that status quo will be maintained on the island
                            and that there will be no pretext for war and no misunderstanding. With
                            settlement of problem of rotation of contingent and guarantees against
                            military provocation, dangerous aspects of problems have been
                            eliminated. It is ridiculous consider minor economic issues as
                            justification for actions which would cause war or peace to hang in
                            balance. If Makarios takes any initiatives which would provoke military
                            action, I will denounce him. I have told Makarios I will not follow him
                            in such action and will not be led to war by him. After all, enosis will
                            eventually be accomplished through union of Cyprus with Greece, not
                            Greece with Cyprus.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou reiterated, as he had at our last meeting, that he regretted
                            certain coolness which had developed in Greek-American relations as
                            result of Cyprus. He hoped this ungrateful period will have passed
                            without harm. Greece has been a sincere and loyal ally both in easy and
                            difficult times and this will continue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> inquired whether in
                            this pre-electoral period there is any real hope that concrete results
                            could be anticipated from direct <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> relations.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> suggested position
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would certainly be easier if it
                            could assert it had established contact with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu</persName> is a
                            man of good will and even Turk military do not want war, but they feel
                            that time is working against them. Papandreou again warned that if
                            discussions were undertaken which after a period of weeks or months were
                            to reach an impasse, possibility of ultimate solution would become even
                            more remote. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> pointed out
                            that if nothing happens, even on surface,<pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0426"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> might within the same period of time
                            find itself at point of no return vis-à-vis Turks. Papandreou insisted
                            that indirect contacts through <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> and Mediator had not produced an impasse, but
                            that an impasse as result of direct conversations would be grave.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou asked toward what type final solution Turks seemed oriented.
                                <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> said he had not come
                            away from Ankara with any very clear impression. Turks seemed rather
                            more preoccupied with concrete facts of current situation, although it
                            had been made clear that enosis is totally excluded as a solution.</p>
                        <p>I alluded to Papandreou's earlier assurance that there would be no
                            pretext or misunderstanding which could justify Turkish attack and that
                            there would be no economic blockade or difficulties regarding Red
                            Crescent supplies. I said frankly our discussions with Garoufalias had
                            not produced this impression, that we believe <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is restless particularly because of alleged oppressive
                            measures against Turk community especially with regard to economic
                            measures. Papandreou laughed and said <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> was very tired after his long meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Cypriot
                            Cabinet. He reiterated his determination to impose on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> such measures as U Thant or
                            United Nations would recommend in these matters.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> noted Tuluy, new Turkish
                            Ambassador in Athens, is an extremely well qualified and able man.
                            Consequently, it might be extremely useful if Costopoulos or <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> could see him soon. Even though
                            situation may not yet be mature enough to approach question of final
                            solution, such contact would be of tremendous value in clearing away
                            misunderstandings of fact regarding situation on the spot and thereby
                            avoid any explosion.</p>
                        <p>I also urged <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> not just await
                            Mediator's report in hope creating new situation but take immediate
                            steps reduce misunderstanding and clear path for the future. Our talks
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> upon his return
                            to Nicosia had not been encouraging and reports from Nicosia itself
                            discouraging. While we have no information which leads us believe Turk
                            community subjected to actual military threat, we are not at all
                            confident GOC will take measures which will relieve economic pressures
                            on Turks. In fact, according to some reports, ideas which I had
                            discussed with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> in response to
                            his suggestion and which he had accepted, had been presented in Nicosia
                            as “American proposals” which GOC had turned down rather than alter its
                            present policy. Position attributed to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, that no flour could be included as part of Red
                            Crescent supplies, hardly confirmed he is prepared cooperate for purpose
                            reducing tension. It would be useful talk directly to Turks about such
                            “details” which, small in themselves, are charged with explosive
                            potentialities. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> added it
                            is much more important for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> convince
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> it is sincerely endeavoring to

                                27. (Ibid.)</note> and that he is prepared to tell him what he has
                            told us. He acknowledged GOG policy may be misunderstood and said he is

                            normal thing and would permit exchange of views without disclosing

                            Papandreou personally to restate directly to <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> line which he has been taking with us. It also
                            afforded Papandreou with an excellent appraisal situation existing in
                            Ankara. As indicated, Papandreou attempted to put best possible face on
                            results of <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>' efforts in
                            Nicosia, as well as to reiterate his thesis, more than somewhat
                            threadbare, that he could impose his authority in Nicosia in those cases
                            where GOG position is morally unassailable. His efforts to discount
                            importance of certain economic pressures being applied against Turk
                            community suggests he does not in fact have much confidence in his
                            ability to insure a complete relaxation in <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' policy in these regards. I am hopeful,

                        <p>In hour and half conversation on March 24, Cypriot Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> reviewed recent
                            Cyprus developments with Secretary, Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>. Meeting at <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s request.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said situation on island
                            now relatively quiet. GOC seeks (1) to reduce tensions and return to
                            normality; (2) agreement on minority rights for Turk-Cypriots. Current
                            tensions caused by self-isolated Turk-Cypriots and their intimidation
                            other Turk-Cypriots. Agreement on minority rights complicated by
                            question of who are true Turk-Cypriot leaders. If there is any serious
                            problem, it is minority rights; GOC prepared to discuss this.</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary reviewed recent talks in which we have been involved.
                            Said GOG suggested US might seek agreement from Turkey that it not
                            intervene on island for six months. Thus climate for negotiations might
                            develop. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> seemed enthusiastic about
                            its suggestion and sent Garoufalias to Nicosia to discuss proposal. Now
                            we hear Garoufalias has had no success in talks with GOC. Under
                            Secretary said he wanted emphasize this Greek idea; we would cooperate
                            by speaking to Turks only if Greece and Cyprus in agreement. What is
                            needed is period of quiet in which parties immediately involved can
                            talk.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> commented GOC could
                            never meet conditions for talks established by Turks since latter and
                            self-imposed Turk-Cypriot blockade only causes current problems. [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Secretary and Under Secretary insisted there
                            other problems such as arms buildup, relief supplies, refugee housing.
                            Secretary said central problem that of Turk-Cypriot security.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied to latter point
                            saying he doubted Turkey only interested in Turk-Cypriot security.
                            Partition remains final aim. Still GOC ready discuss minority rights
                            which could be guaranteed by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> whether
                            Cyprus remains independent or joins Greece. There could even be <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> observers to oversee minority
                            guarantees.</p>

                        <p>Under Secretary said these thoughts worth exploring with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Pointed out formation new Turkish
                                Cabinet<note n="2" xml:id="d185fn2">On February 26, the Justice

                            on that basis seemed impossible, then GOC should try another approach.
                            Important point is to get talks started. But if GOC wants useful
                            discussions, it must suspend actions which would hinder talks.</p>
                        <p>Secretary said thought had come to him which he had not explored with
                            anyone. Present Turk-Cypriot and Greek-Cypriot officials elected to
                            govern Cyprus, not to negotiate communal settlement. Perhaps communities
                            could now hold new elections for sole purpose electing small number
                            delegates to something like constitutional convention. Delegates could
                            explore possibilities of interim arrangement and then during extended
                            truce examine possible long term solutions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said his immediate
                            personal thought was that only GOC officials could represent
                            Greek-Cypriot side, but elections might be held by Turk-Cypriots.
                            However, how could GOC talk to Denktash, for example, without hurting
                            real moderates like Ihsan Ali? How could Turk-Cypriots hold free
                            elections when extremists intimidate moderates?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> inquired about possible
                            talks with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> thought discussions with
                            Turk-Cypriots would be easier for GOC and perhaps for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> also. Latter would certainly
                            participate from behind curtain anyway. Asked whether Turks would be
                            prepared to talk directly, Under Secretary replied we did not have
                            Turkish proxy, but since Turks ready to talk to Greeks, they might also
                            be ready talk to Greek-Cypriots. We know Turks sick of crisis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said recent period has
                            been one marked by waiting for developments such as <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debate, mediator's report. Latter
                            expected within next few days, after which new phase will begin. This
                            phase should be based on frank talks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> asked whether
                            Cypriot-Turkish talks would be better than some between Greek-Cypriots
                            and Turk-Cypriots. Under Secretary said we only interested in helping
                            talks begin and precise composition of parties a secondary point. If
                            talks began between Turk-Cypriots and Greek-Cypriots, they would
                            probably eventually be expanded to include Greece and Turkey anyway.
                            Important point is to begin talks and see how they go. It would be
                            welcome initiative if Archbishop would inform Turkey he plans to
                            initiate talks with Turk-Cypriots and, if there progress, Turkey and
                            Greece should eventually join discussions. If <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> did not want to make this
                            approach directly, perhaps Athens could make it for him.</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0430"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> asked whether Turkey
                            would accept such an approach. Under Secretary replied we do not know,
                            but important point is to explore such ideas and see where talks might
                            lead. Suggested recent assignment new ambassadors in Athens and Ankara
                            might present useful opportunity. What we hope for is conversations.
                            Immediately involved parties should determine precise procedures and USG
                            would be helpful where possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> concluded saying would
                            wait for mediator's report and then determine what to do next.</p>
                        <p>During conversation there were several exchanges on two immediate
                            problems:</p>
                        <p>Red Crescent supplies: <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            said GOC could not extend free entry procedures since there ample
                            supplies on island and businessmen would be hurt. ICRC had said latest
                            customs free shipment should be last. Under Secretary said in this
                            problem we faced with an immediate condition, not mere theory. Lawyers
                            should be first to appreciate importance not being too legalistic. If
                            GOC wants meaningful talks, it should suspend actions standing in way of
                            those talks.</p>
                        <p>Ambelikou: <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said current
                            situation seriously increases tension and asked why Greek-Cypriots could
                            not withdraw as requested by <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>. Kyprianou said <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> had not acted when asked by GOC and so
                            Greek-Cypriots must now take own action to counteract Turk-Cypriot
                            moves. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> clearly in wrong at Ambelikou.
                            Under Secretary said <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should be
                            considered neutral force whose requests given special consideration.</p>
                        <p>Greek Ambassador informed <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>
                            March 25 that <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> told him
                            that US officials had not pointed to “perils of situation” and were not
                            “alarmed”. He was disturbed because this was counter to his reporting to
                            Athens and his recommendations for action because of “critical phase”.
                            We suspect <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s remarks to
                            him may have been ploy to resist GOG pressures. However <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> we would endeavor to clarify in Nicosia and
                            Athens as appropriate.</p>

                        <p>Your discussion with Isik may provide an opportunity to bring the Turks
                            nearer to reality. At the moment it is difficult to find any thread of
                            rational strategy in their conduct. The purely negative position they
                            have taken is not good enough. We have been trying to prevent public
                            discussion of the report. However, by disqualifying Mediator and
                            repeatedly threatening military action, Turks have opened the way for a
                            GOC initiative for early <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> debate on
                            Cyprus issue. Moreover, they have weakened their position in that
                            debate. Yet they will certainly ask our support and be bitter if they do
                            not receive it.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances I think you should take a strong line with
                            Isik. You should emphasize that Turkey is tearing itself apart over a
                            situation that involves only 100,000 Turks and that the world is getting
                            tired of stubborn inability of a handful of people to live together. We
                            have made a great effort to assist Turkey to find an honorable solution.
                            But Turkey's position does not improve with time.</p>
                        <p>We have made clear from the beginning that there was only one way to
                            solve the Cyprus problem and that was by negotiation. This also is the
                            burden of the Mediator's report. The Mediator suggests that negotiations
                            start between the two communities on Cyprus. This may be impracticable
                            but the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> might still find some profit
                            in announcing that it was advising the Turkish Community to begin such
                            negotiations. This could put <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on the spot. Obviously, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could provide <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0432"/>competent men who could serve as
                            advisors to the Turkish Community if such negotiations ever
                            materialized.</p>
                        <p>If the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> does not regard this formula
                            as feasible, it might propose to negotiate directly with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on behalf of the Turkish
                            Community. This might be one way of forcing the hand of the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>—compelling it to undertake negotiations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> or risk losing its position
                            in the situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> has expressed concern about the
                            apparently aimless direction of Turkish actions and you may wish to
                            raise one or more of the following questions:</p>
                        <p>1. If <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> expects our support, we think
                            they owe us fuller explanation of what they are really driving at,
                            expressed not in terms of ideal desiderata but of real possibilities in
                            real world.</p>
                        <p>2. It not at all clear to us what <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            really expects to achieve through present course of action.</p>
                        <p>3. After Geneva experience, do Turks think <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has capability of forcing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept either partition or Federation?</p>
                        <p>4. Does <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> hope keep Cyprus problem on
                            shelf for six months (beyond Turkish elections) meanwhile trying prevent
                            status and welfare Turk-Cypriots from deteriorating?</p>
                        <p>5. We had understood <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wanted
                            protection for Turk-Cypriots and assurances against enosis; if Turks
                            feel guarantees these two items insufficiently stated in report, what
                            guarantees conceivably acceptable to other side would they propose?</p>
                        <p>6. If <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> continues along present course,
                            we must assume question of <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>
                            report will come up for debate before UNSC very soon; how can US or
                            other friends of Turkey be helpful unless we are fully informed re
                            objectives present Turkish posture and actions?</p>
                        <p>You may wish also mention following elements in <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report which Turks might find
                            positive and useable.</p>
                        <p>1. Debarring of enosis.</p>
                        <p>2. Demilitarization (genuinely demilitarized Cyprus would greatly reduce
                            Turkey's security worries).</p>
                        <p>3. Human rights (<persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s
                            suggestions leave considerable room for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to maneuver, particularly in developing international
                            institutional arrangements ultimately to replace London-Zurich).</p>
                        <p>4. Autonomy for Turk Cypriot community in communal affairs, specifically
                            education, religion, and personal status.</p>
                        <p>5. Recognition of “hard fact” of distinctive character of two communities
                            and that, without weakening unity of state, Turkish Cypriots should have
                            “an equitable part in public life of country as whole.”</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> role in settlement (<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> assistance in demilitarization; <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> safeguard of human rights; <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> guarantee of final settlement terms).</p>

                        <p>1519. Ambassador called last night on <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Papandreou and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> was also present. Bourguiba had just
                            completed a 3-day official visit<note n="2" xml:id="d187fn2">April
                                5–8.</note> and Papandreou was evidently tired from obligations
                            involved in visit. Despite <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s
                            weariness, he seemed relaxed.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou initiated discussion by having <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> read text of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> statement on <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>
                                1517).<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3">Dated April 9. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 27 CYP)</note> PriMin observed that there
                            is basic “contradiction” in Mediator's report since it recognized right
                            of self-determination but then suggested Cypriots should deny themselves
                            that right because of threat from Turkey. Thus <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> was in effect asking Cypriots to
                            renounce rights guaranteed by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter
                            because of threat by one member of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            against another. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is, however,
                            attempting mold its policy in harmony with <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report, since it is <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> view that <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>
                            should continue his role. There are two aspects to Cyprus question:
                            first is need for provisional settlement and secondly final solution.
                            Until now, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> policy has been to wait
                            for submission of Mediator's report. Now that report has been issued,
                            basic question is what to do next.</p>
                        <p>In view of “vacuum” currently existing following publication of <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would like to demonstrate “good will.” <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had “obliged” <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to give “real pacification”
                            to Turk-Cypriots. First step is to begin negotiations between two
                            communities on Cyprus. However, to do this Mediator must play role.
                            Since Kuchuk would not <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0434"/>respond
                            to simple request to talk, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will seek <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s assistance. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he continued, has had erroneous idea that
                            Cyprus exists in isolation and consequently has assumed that by
                            terrorizing Turk Cypriots they will submit. This, however, ignores fact
                            that Turkish state and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> exist and since
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' “defeat” in his
                            relations with Moscow <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            no longer has courage to insist on his own policy.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou then referred to question of direct negotiations between
                            Ankara and Athens. Papandreou observed that new Turk Ambassador, Tuluy,
                            is “difficult” but that he has organized mind and could give intelligent
                            answers “even when we disagree.” He had told Tuluy that until now he had
                            refused negotiations not because he is uncompromising, but because he
                            has perhaps been “wise.” Failure of direct negotiations could lead to
                            rupture in relations between <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. Even now time is “not yet
                            ripe.” Talks now would simply mean each side would air its views, with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> advocating partition or
                            federation and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> supporting enosis.
                            Result would be stalemate or even worse.</p>
                        <p>Rather than holding talks between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> now on substance of problem,
                            more meaningful step would be to “show our good will” and thus win time.
                            Both sides must try to progress on day-by-day basis through maintenance
                            of contact through diplomatic channels. Beginning will be by
                            pacification in Cyprus “through total protection of Turkish minority.”
                            He had told Amb Tuluy time is necessary because there will be elections
                            in Turkey in September or October and present GOT would find it
                            difficult to make sacrifices immediately before elections. Thus, as
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> sees it, appropriate schedule is
                            for negotiations now in Cyprus between two communities with help of
                            Mediator to be followed by negotiations between Ankara and Athens after
                            Turkish elections. Although Tuluy did not express agreement he said he
                            would transmit these thoughts to his govt.</p>
                        <p>Question of final solution still remains, Papandreou acknowledged. From
                            point of view of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> it is not
                            imperative find an immediate permanent solution since time is working
                            for Greeks. Greeks control 98 percent of area of island and 98 percent
                            of its military force. Situation cannot remain stationary, however,
                            because (1) <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> cannot continue
                            forever and (2) Turkish restiveness cannot be indefinitely restrained.
                            Plaza report had made it clear London and Zurich are unworkable and that
                            there can be no federation and no partition. Therefore, there are only
                            two possibilities for future of Cyprus: (1) completely independent
                            Cyprus and (2) Cyprus as part of Greece—enosis. Put another way, choice
                            is between “oriental” (pro-Soviet) Cyprus and “occidental” Cyprus, which
                            through union with Greece would become part of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou then outlined <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> criteria in
                            Cyprus solution. Basically, they are (1) protection of Turkish minority,
                            which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> was willing <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0435"/>to guarantee, (2) security of Turkish
                            state, which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could provide through
                            Cyprus' membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and (3)
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> prestige, which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is willing to “assure”.</p>
                        <p>With regard <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> prestige, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said settlement could be handled
                            in such way it would seem to be Turkish victory. When Ambassador pressed
                            Papandreou on what <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could actually
                            give which would meet demands of Turkish prestige, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> could only answer that
                            “something” would be given, but that he did not know precisely what at
                            present time.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou then reverted to practical steps which could be taken to
                            ensure provisional tranquility. He said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> wished collaborate with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> for complete pacification of island and that he had
                            repeated this to Amb Tuluy on previous evening during reception for
                            Bourguiba. Even if <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> rejects <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will seek to find way to bring about peace on island in
                            conjunction with Turks. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            reiterated that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is working to create
                            situation in which war would never arise as result Turkish
                            “misunderstanding.” If conflict came it would be only because Turks
                            wanted it and not due to misunderstanding of Greek intentions.
                            Papandreou referred to fact that Tuluy had given Costopoulos an
                            aide-mémoire (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1454)<note n="4" xml:id="d187fn4">Dated April 4. (Ibid.)</note> containing list of

                            serious attention in hope correcting most conditions to which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> objects.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador referred to question of Soviet SAM's for Cyprus. Papandreou
                            said this question is finished as far as <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is concerned and that DefMin <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> had given strict orders that no Greek be
                            involved in any aspect of this program. When Ambassador pressed for
                            information on what arrangements <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had made for training of Cypriot personnel and
                            delivery of additional missiles, Papandreou disclaimed any knowledge.
                            However, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> referred to
                            rumor reported by Grivas that Egyptians considering training Cypriots in
                            use of the missiles without knowledge of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            asserted he had instructed Greek Ambassador who had been in Athens
                            during <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> visit to inform
                            GOC that if such thing happened, all agreements between Cyprus and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> should be considered as

                            to this end. Papandreou has had two conversations with Tuluy and
                            Costopoulos at least three, including one this morning.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> seems confident of its ability to
                            encourage a reduction of tension in the island. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> also appreciates fact <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report represents substantial tactical advantage
                            for Greek case which, accompanied by <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0436"/>decreasing tension on the island, might hopefully
                            create a situation in which new efforts find solution could be fruitful.
                            However, this calculation would collapse if Turks, aware that time is on
                            Greek side and sensitive to increasingly less favorable position of
                            Turkish case vis-à-vis world opinion, were to permit initiatives by
                            Turkish community which might galvanize situation into new crisis.</p>
                        <p>Recent references in Athens press to <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> plan as well as from Papandreou's formulation of

                        <p>1104. Department please repeat to field as appropriate. Secretary in
                            breakfast talk with Turkish Foreign Minister Isik this morning
                            repeatedly emphasized that US would hope for and expect full
                            consultations with <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in advance of
                            any military action Turkey might decide necessary to ensure physical

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> said he was unable to give
                            such assurance. Secretary then warned that in event <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> takes action without consultation
                            Turkey would find itself isolated and this would spell disaster. Isik
                            indicated he understood this point and insisted that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would take military action only if
                            forced by circumstances to do so. He implied that such circumstances <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0437"/>might include (1) protracted
                            threat to well being Turkish Cypriot community or (2) attempt by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to bring about
                            “juridical” fait accompli further diminishing rights of Turkish
                            community. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, he said, would not take
                            action impulsively.</p>
                        <p>Secretary pointed out that juridical innovations could always be changed
                            by negotiations but Isik replied that GOI now has no other means than
                            military action to oppose Greek Cypriot domination Turkish
                            community.</p>
                        <p>Looking beyond Cyprus dispute to long-term objective of improvement
                            relations between Turkey and Greece, Secretary asked Isik what role
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would like to see us play.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName>'s answer was that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should seek to ascertain basic
                            conditions sought by both sides, try to find a solution and then push
                            both to agree. When US begins pushing Turks, provided solution be
                            presented privately rather than in a public report, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will study US proposal “as carefully as
                            possible.” Secretary emphasized that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            has no independent view of Cyprus problem. Our objective has always been
                            to help bring about a solution acceptable to parties to dispute.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> assured Secretary that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is “really interested” in talks with
                            Greek Government if there is some prospect of concrete results.
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> feared that it would not
                            be possible to preserve relations with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> if urgent question of physical situation of Turkish
                            Cypriot community is not settled within a “normal” period of time. If
                            basic preconditions of (1) no territorial annexation and (2) no Greek
                            Cypriot domination of Turkish community are acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, Isik felt there might be some hope
                            that secret talks could lead to an agreed solution.</p>

                        <p>1342. We believe that efforts you have made so far to bring more reality
                            to Greek consideration of possible elements of Cyprus solution should be
                            accelerated.</p>
                        <p>One of points toward which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> exhibits
                            less comprehension, particularly since submission <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report, is unattainability of
                            enosis without compensation to Turkey. This applies whether enosis
                            sought in immediate future or over years as reportedly under
                            consideration by <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Suggest you use occasion of your farewell talks with <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>, Papandreou, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> and others to help Greeks
                            clarify in their own mind:</p>
                        <p>(1) Enosis cannot be achieved without compensation;</p>
                        <p>(2) If Greeks attempt enosis without prior arrangement with Turkey, there
                            will be violent action by Turks. They have made this clear in public and
                            private statements;</p>
                        <p>(3) Western alliance cannot be expected impose enosis or restrain Turk
                            action while instant enosis attempted. Both Greece and Turkey are
                            important to Western alliance and we could not (even if capable of doing
                            so) try to help bring about enosis at expense of a frustrated Turkey who
                            would surely then follow neutralist policies.</p>
                        <p>It seems to us that more realistic consideration by Greeks of above
                            points would help <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> in
                            proposed initial talks with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName>

                        <p>Secto 16. The Secretary's conversation at noon today with <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> and Pilavachi showed clearly
                            that Greeks feel on very shaky ground in regard to proposed bilateral
                            talks with Turks re Cyprus.<note n="3" xml:id="d190fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> met during the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting. Their discussions were

                            worrying them seem to be:</p>
                        <p>A. Turkish insistence on talking about conditions for continued
                            independence of Cyprus and reluctance to discuss enosis.<note n="4" xml:id="d190fn4">Reported in Secun 11 from London, May 11.
                                (Ibid.)</note>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> repeated point he had
                            previously made to <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> that
                            Greece had no right to negotiate about independence of island in absence
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that any attempt
                            to do so would open way for Archbishop to sabotage whole operation. On
                            this, we suggested talks might begin without any prior understanding as
                            to their basis and that Greeks could take initiative to bring up enosis
                            with compensation at very beginning, thus channelling further discussion
                            in right track from their point of view. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> looked dubious and did not comment.</p>
                        <p>B. Greece does not feel it can undertake talks without some <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> connection; <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> thinks it important that “third person” at
                            least have blessing of UNSYG even if he is selected by prior agreement
                            by the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Still thinks New York is best location and cannot
                            accept Turkish idea of talks under <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            auspices. We asked whether Greeks had yet made suggestion about New York
                            to Turks. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said no and
                            indicated he was hoping we would present this idea to Turks. Secretary
                            asked why they could not sit down together and exchange ideas on their
                            respective 1st, 2nd and 3rd choices for location and personalities to be
                            involved; perhaps one of these sets would match. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> did not respond directly,
                            merely reiterating difficulty of discussing anything but enosis in
                            absence of Cypriot representative.</p>
                        <p>C. He fears Turks will be unwilling devote time necessary to work out
                            solution this very difficult problem and that if there are any delays in
                            course of talks Turks will charge bad faith and take action or make
                            threats which will completely upset situation. Secretary emphasized that
                            to prevent such actions or threats it was absolutely essential to have
                            complete calm on island and full protection for Turkish-Cypriots.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0440"/>rejoined it was equally
                            necessary that Greeks and Patriarchate in Istanbul be protected,
                            otherwise Greek public would explode. He urged that we use our influence
                            to make this point understood in Ankara.</p>
                        <p>D. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> fears Turks want to
                            make propaganda out of fact talks underway and might prematurely reveal
                            substance of discussions. He emphasized that to prevent difficulties in
                            Greece and above all sabotage by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> there must be absolute secrecy about substance,
                            but he agreed it would probably be impossible to prevent public
                            knowledge of fact talks themselves were underway. Secretary said he
                            thought it should be possible to maintain secrecy on substance.</p>
                        <p>In course of discussion Secretary reiterated advice he had given Isik
                            that above all contact must be maintained and participants must not be
                            easily discouraged. Over a period of time new ideas might emerge.
                            Assured <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> that he
                            believed <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> genuinely desired to
                            keep things quiet on island, something which was essential to make
                            lengthy talks possible.</p>
                        <p>Greeks mentioned Inonu press statement supporting present Turkish Cabinet
                            in relation to Cyprus issue. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> himself volunteered that this seemed to show
                            Turks really meant business. Secretary concurred.</p>
                        <p>Secretary asked about reaction to set of “agreed principles” we had
                            submitted to them and to Turks.<note n="5" xml:id="d190fn5">Reported in

                            <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> replied most of
                            points were acceptable but he felt there should be some additions. Also
                            remarked that some points seemed in conflict with UNSC resolution of
                            March 4. Secretary pointed out that if Greece and Turkey could agree on
                            anything, they would certainly get unanimous endorsement from <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> asked whether our idea was that agreed
                            principles should be published once understanding reached with Turks.
                            Secretary said no, that idea was to give two parties a common basis to
                            build on and enable them to launch negotiations on the easier rather
                            than the most difficult issues. <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> suggested, however, that if agreement could be
                            reached there would seem to be definite advantages in publishing, since
                            a great many people in Greece and Turkey and elsewhere must be anxiously
                            looking for signs of hope. <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> replied problem would be adverse effect
                            publication would have on Cyprus. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> suggested he could talk to Isik about
                            principles tonight. Secretary agreed but said he did not think too much
                            time should be spent on this at present moment since first essential was
                            to get agreement on procedures.</p>
                        <p>With further reference to danger of violent action on either side,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said we must keep
                            in mind terribly important humanitarian <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0441"/>aspect. If Turks attacked Cyprus whether by land or by
                            bombing, Makarios would proceed to kill all Turkish-Cypriots and Turks
                            would retaliate by killing all Greeks in Istanbul. Secretary again
                            emphasized importance that there be complete calm on island. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> said during recent meetings
                            in Athens Makarios had repeatedly promised <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> he would keep peace and abolish all measures directed
                            against Turkish-Cypriots. He had also promised to refrain from
                            initiating changes which would likely to provoke Turks: A) he will not
                            carry out his plan to call new elections this summer when his present
                            mandate runs out—instead he will continue in office without raising
                            issue; B) he also agreed to refrain from appointing a pro-Greek
                            Turkish-Cypriot minister, GOG having told him he must not bring a
                            Quisling into his Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>Secretary suggested it might be useful for Turkish Ambassador Athens and
                            Greek Ambassador-designate Ankara (both of whom are in London) get
                            together this afternoon to see if they could smooth over some procedural
                            difficulties before tonight's meeting. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> gave tentative endorsement to this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary asked if there was anything special <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could do to help negotiations along. <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> indicated he did not want
                            US participating, since that would be regarded in Greece and Cyprus as
                            US interference and pressure. He made no concrete suggestion except to
                            say that he hoped for continued close US interest and occasional
                            help.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Pilavachi should meet with <persName corresp="#p_JJD1">Jernegan</persName> tomorrow morning to report on how things go
                            tonight. (Will be recalled Isik is seeing Secretary again tomorrow, at

                                procedures for talks on Cyprus and provided details of concluding

                            condemns Greco-Turkish dialogue, contending Cypriots must be allowed to

                            terms. He might figure best way achieving his goals would be to undercut
                            Greeks by offering Turks independence which they find more

                            example, report he is “calling back” Galo Plaza has caused Turks to

                        <p>1779. <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> came to
                            see me last evening.</p>
                        <p>He said his father's conversation yesterday morning with Turk Ambassador
                            Tuluy had gone well. Although understanding reached during <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> talks in London provided that Greek Ambassador
                            Sgourdeos would discuss possibilities Cyprus solution in Ankara with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had moved directly into the matter with Tuluy.
                            According to Andreas (who had not been present himself), <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> followed very closely line which
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> had outlined to me last

                        <p>(A) <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> prepared to discuss enosis,
                            immediate or deferred;</p>
                        <p>(B) <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> prepared to give consideration to
                            any reasonable system of protection for Turk minority;</p>
                        <p>(C) <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> security interests much better
                            preserved by inclusion Cyprus in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            as result of enosis. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> both confronted by Slav-Communist
                            pressures and would continue to have common defense interests even if
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ceased to function;</p>
                        <p>(D) Question of Turk prestige is problem to be dealt with although it is
                            subjective and not susceptible satisfaction on basis of logic or of
                            right. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> prepared to discuss this
                            matter in effort to find bearable concessions which might assuage
                            Turkish prestige. Exact nature of what such concessions might be was
                            apparently not discussed.</p>
                        <p>Although no specific conclusions were reached, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> was pleased with Tuluy's general reaction. Tuluy at
                            one point proposed an <persName corresp="#p_UAS1">Urguplu<pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0444"/>
                            </persName>-Papandreou meeting, to which Papandreou apparently replied
                            that he is prepared to accept but wished to await prior measure of
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>I inquired whether any word had been received from MOD <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> presently attending <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Defense Ministers' meeting in
                            Paris.</p>
                        <p> Andreas said <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> had had
                            conversation with his Turkish counterpart and had reported that latter
                            seemed disposed to discuss question of enosis.</p>
                        <p> Andreas said he also wanted to apprise me of an important new
                            development in Cyprus problem. On basis information he had received
                            personally yesterday as well as information also received by <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName> two things are now
                            clear:</p>
                        <p>(1) <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and GOC are not
                            prepared to give any concessions to achieve enosis—“no British base, not
                            even a pair of shoes”. GOC will, however, mask its position by speaking
                            loudly of unconditional enosis. Most Greek political leaders believe
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> does not want
                            enosis. This is a conclusion which he (Andreas) is coming to accept, but
                            of which he is not yet irrevocably convinced since <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is a very clever politician.
                            Although public opinion in Cyprus can be readily influenced, pro- enosis
                            sentiment on the island is at the moment much less than it was six
                            months ago.</p>
                        <p>(2) <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will call for
                            Presidential elections by June 15.</p>
                        <p>I said I understood that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            had specifically promised during meeting of Crown Council not to take
                            any action regarding elections unless his legal position were challenged
                            by Turks (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1672).<note n="3" xml:id="d192fn3">Telegram 1672 from Athens, May 8, reported
                                discussions at the Crown Council meeting on Cyprus. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Andreas confirmed this and said this had been recorded in minutes of
                            meeting. However, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is
                            basically apprehensive that once his mandate has legally expired his
                            position will depend to a large extent on attitude which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would adopt toward him and he does not
                            wish to make himself vulnerable to possible pressure from <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p> Andreas noted that Turkish reaction to elections might seriously
                            jeopardize any prospect of successful <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> conversations and
                            might even provoke military intervention by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Question of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' policy was
                            discussed yesterday during meeting of Cabinet Political Council (<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> and himself. <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> in Paris). During meeting <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> declared his intention maintain
                            present <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> course, to continue talks
                            with Turks, and to break openly with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if need be. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> transmitted long message to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Andreas acknowledged that in
                            face this situation <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> might wish to
                            accelerate discussions with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. In any
                            event, he emphasized it is very important that substance <pb n="407" xml:id="pg_407" facs="0445"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            conversations be kept highly confidential and protected from premature
                            disclosure to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Position attributed to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> by Andreas does not seem
                            surprising as moment of serious <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> conversations
                            approaches and in light Nicosia's recent reports including <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName>'s conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p> Andreas' own position is, however, somewhat obscure. As Dept aware,
                            Andreas is widely considered to have close and sympathetic relations
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and to have played
                            an important role in rejection of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> plan last summer.</p>
                        <p>In this connection <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            commented to me recently that inasmuch as Andreas was also present
                            during my conversation with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> on
                            May 26 regarding <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> Cyprus policy,
                            substance conversation had probably been reported to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. In short, while I believe
                            Andreas was factually accurate, I am not entirely certain whether he is
                            basically supporting <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> or
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> at this juncture.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of pleasantries, the Secretary informed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> that he hopes there will be no
                            trouble in Cyprus since we have <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0446"/>enough trouble elsewhere. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> responded that he doesn't think there will be
                            any. He continued that he expects the Security Council meeting to be
                            very short and quiet. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            understands that the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> favors a
                            6-month extension of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>; and
                            while he sees some psychological disadvantage in such an
                            extension—because people looking for a settlement will assume that
                            nothing will be forthcoming for six months—on balance he feels that the
                            advantages outweigh the disadvantages and that the 6-months extension
                            will be passed.<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">U.N. Security Council

                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that the GOC is
                            doing its best to maintain peace. No major incidents have occurred for
                            some months. The GOC has been trying to normalize the situation in
                            Paphos, Limassol and Larnaca and things have been improving in those
                            districts. The Limassol incident and other isolated incidents are
                            accidents. There have been other isolated incidents instigated from the
                            outside. In Limassol, the Turkish employees of Greek factories have been
                            returning to work recently.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked about the economy of the island. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that it is not bad.
                            Tourism has been off, but <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            has taken up the slack in tourism. He said that when some people had
                            suggested cutting down the numbers of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, he had countered by saying that the number should
                            remain the same since <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            expenditures are important economically to Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated that the GOC
                            has not objected to the Greek- Turkish dialogue despite its strong
                            belief, as a matter of principle, that the Cypriots should be allowed to
                            decide their future for themselves, and that no solution should come
                            from the outside. Makarios does not object to the talks if the subject
                            is enosis. If the subject is not enosis, however, the GOC does not see
                            how Greece and Turkey can negotiate, since they cannot negotiate for an
                            independent Cyprus. Cyprus itself would have to be brought into these
                            discussions. After all, it is an independent country, recognized by the
                            United Nations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said
                            that Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>
                            had made the point to him in London that Greece could only discuss some
                            form of enosis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said the Greek Cypriots
                            can never accept any solution involving any form of partition, whether
                            outright partition or some settlement leading to partition. The reasons
                            for this are twofold: 1) the Greek Cypriots feel very strongly against
                            partition and 2) the presence of Turks in Cyprus would be the beginning
                            of a new Cyprus problem. Continuous frictions resulting from partition
                            or cession of any part of Cyprus would lead to other hostilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> then asked if the Turks
                            are really prepared to consider enosis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said the Turks apparently would consider <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0447"/>several solutions, including
                            enosis. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said the Greek
                            Cypriots feel that enosis must take place but that it must be “outright
                            union” of all Cyprus. What will satisfy Turkey, which needs compensation
                            for reasons of prestige? The Cypriots have considered 1) strong
                            guarantees for the minority, and 2) some form of demilitarization
                            similar to that in the Dodecanese islands. The Greek Cypriots are
                            looking for ideas so long as they do not involve territorial cession. He
                            added that the Greek Cypriots regret that the Mediator is not continuing
                            since he could fill the gaps which might occur, for example, if the
                            Greco-Turkish talks break down.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that Makarios had asked him to ask whether we
                            are now willing to tell the GOC in confidence that we favor one solution
                            or another, and then work with the GOC to implement that solution. If,
                            for example, we favor enosis, talks outside the Greek-Turkish dialogue
                            could be started. Since the Greeks and Turks are now discussing enosis
                            among other things, GOC–<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> talks would
                            not be anything the other parties do not want. He remarked at this point
                            that only enosis will provide a lasting solution, while all others will
                            lead to other problems. The Secretary then asked if the GOC had had
                            consultations with Turkey. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that they had not.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the starting point must be that conditions on the
                            island give diplomacy a chance. Nothing should be allowed to get in the
                            way of talks. This goes further than just people killing each other, and
                            extends to the whole situation. He wondered if diplomatic channels might
                            quietly dig up clues for other settlements. He does not see any formal
                            role for the US at this time and asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> what he thought. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> replied that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> is asking that if we think of anything, we
                            should discuss it with the GOC. Our experience has taught us that the US
                            label has definite disadvantages to both sides. The Greeks and Turks in
                            London both thought a US role would not be helpful at this time. Based
                            on our experience, any American role would tend to impede acceptance
                            rather than facilitate it. The Secretary added that our role had not
                            produced much thus far.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said his suggestion is
                            really that the GOC and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> work
                            together. He does not believe anything will come from the Greek-Turkish
                            talks. The GOC believes that more would come from GOC–<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> talks on the basis of a solution. If
                            the solution is independence, there is not much the US can do. If the
                            basis is outright enosis, the consultations would be helpful.
                            Consultations would not commit or hurt anyone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> raised the question whether
                            talks with the Turks would be worthwhile. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that no direct contacts between the
                            GOC and the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> or the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will provide a formula. He said that he felt that
                                GOC–<gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> informal consultations would
                            be the only talks that would produce results.</p>
                        <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the removal of Turkey's objection to enosis
                            is of joint interest to both Greece and Cyprus. Has Cyprus discussed
                            this fully with Greece? <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            replied that it has but only up to a point, adding that if everybody was
                            not in such a hurry for a settlement, things might be easier.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to point out that there is a
                            difference between talks and negotiations. In preliminary talks, it has
                            been useful oftentimes to have no agenda, with nothing listed and
                            nothing excluded. In the course of this kind of discussion, a solution
                            can sometimes be found. How would <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> feel about this sort of approach? <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that such talks could
                            be useful with us or the British. However, it is a question of the
                            Turkish mentality, and the Turks are always ready to look with suspicion
                            upon every Cypriot suggestion. The Secretary said that he did not
                            necessarily mean GOC–<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> talks. He
                            merely meant that oftentimes parties to a dispute are able to iron out
                            differences through this informal type of meeting. He cited the Chamizal
                            dispute with Mexico as an example, saying we had found a solution to a
                            problem that had been in existence for fifty years through this
                            approach. He cited as another example his talks with <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> in Berlin, when the informal
                            talks actually revealed that there were no grounds for negotiations. He
                            cited the technique as useful, however.</p>
                        <p>In answer to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s
                            suggestion, the Secretary said that channels of diplomacy between us are
                            always open. We are always glad to hear any suggestions the Cypriots
                            might have, and will pass along any ideas and suggestions we might have.
                            He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> if he had any
                            ideas on this subject. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName>
                            stated that he would like to give some thought to this to see what we
                            might come up with. He asked when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> planned to leave New York, and said that he
                            would get in touch with him before he leaves. The Secretary said again
                            that what happens on the island is very important to a settlement. He
                            said specifically that the removal of fear from the island is a basic
                            ingredient to any settlement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> then said that the
                            Archbishop had asked him to ask what objection the US had to missiles on
                            Cyprus. (He said he could not use the word “objection” in public, but
                            could do so in this meeting.) The missiles are defensive rather than
                            offensive, he said. In view of this, what objections would we have. The
                            Archbishop is under some domestic political pressures to bring them in,
                            since everybody knows that the GOC has bought them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would speak very frankly. The military
                            advantages of this missile are not very great. Any low-flying plane
                            could easily knock them out. On the other hand, the political
                            disadvantages of bringing them in are very, very great. The Secretary
                            said that the Archbishop <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0449"/>should
                            look at this from the very sophisticated military point of view and
                            weigh this against the heavy political disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> then asked why
                            objections arose if the missiles were not very dangerous. The Secretary
                            replied that they are politically stimulating and they increase
                            tensions. He could see no advantage at all for Cyprus to have these
                            missiles. He said that he could not see how Cyprus could want union with
                            a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country and have Soviet
                            missiles. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> then said that
                            our original difficulties lay in having <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> trained personnel also being trained to man Soviet
                            missiles, since it was possible that they would reveal information about
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> missiles which should not be
                            revealed. He reiterated that politically it would be very bad and that
                            tensions would be created by the missiles.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this would also create some difficulty for us
                            with Congress. He hoped Kyprianou would urge <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to look at this in the most
                            sophisticated and detailed terms with regard to what the missiles mean
                            to Cyprus militarily and politically.</p>

                        <p>Basically, govt is now paying for its accumulated mistakes over past year
                            and half. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s juggling act, of
                            playing off one faction against another, which served him so well during
                            early months in keeping party together, appears to be breaking down as
                            party criticism of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s
                            leadership mounts. Pro-govt press, which was such valuable weapon in
                            beating down periodic revolts which cropped up during 1964 is now
                            increasingly critical of Papandreou. Cumulative resentment of Andreas
                            and his activities is certainly a major cause of the problems which
                            confront the <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Both left and right within Center Union are unhappy over <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s temporizing. Conservatives,
                            always concerned over Papandreou's lenient attitude towards cooperation
                            with left, are now disturbed at <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s acceptance of army's involvement in partisan
                            politics. On the other hand, left wing of party, which has been
                            increasingly critical of what it considers Papandreou's efforts to
                            placate Palace, is now bitter at <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s decision to permit statute of limitations to be
                            invoked in DEI case. Extreme left had been eagerly anticipating putting
                            its old enemy, Constantine Caramanlis, in dock; however, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s action, after building up
                            leftist hopes since February, has snatched away this prospect at last

                        <p>Army, which from beginning has been unenthusiastic about Papandreou
                            administration, is now widely disillusioned with his govt. First real
                            jolt came with publication of so-called Operation Pericles plan in Feb,
                            in which, much to distress of military leadership, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> used Lt. Gen Loukakis as his
                            hatchet man in attempt to implicate army in exercise of partisan
                            political activity in support of <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>
                            1961 electoral campaign (A–739). Now, “Aspida” case has further
                            undermined <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s prestige with
                            senior officers. Moreover, DefMin <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>, who was considered conservative element in
                            Cabinet, has demonstrated disappointing willingness to accommodate
                            himself to some extent to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            game.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Rumors of Coup d'Etat</p>
                        <p>One feature present political climate is existence of rumors re possible
                            army moves against Papandreou govt, fanned by extreme left. IntMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> this week told Emb
                            officer he, too, was concerned about these rumors. While senior military
                            officials have given no indication of such intentions, number of them
                            have expressed concern in recent days about drift of current political
                            situation. Retired Gen. Sakellariou, who was ousted last year as Army
                            Chief of Staff, told Emb officers openly last week that it is essential
                            Papandreou be “overthrown” before he drags country down to destruction.
                            Certainly army leadership is strongly opposed to <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>, whom it regards as
                            leftist sympathizer who might lead Greece out of Western camp if he ever
                            came to power.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>However, from all indications, talk of possible coup d'etat remains in
                            rumor stage despite uneasiness it creates in political circles. Before
                            military leadership would attempt such move, it would almost certainly
                            seek Palace's approval. There are no indications, however, that
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> would be willing to go
                            along with any extralegal solution at present time, despite the strong
                            anti-Papandreou propaganda he is undoubtedly subject to from various
                            rightwing sources. Palace was unquestionably upset by revelation of
                            “Aspida” affair and involvement of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s son (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>

                                GREECE)</note> Particularly disturbing to <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> was implication that “Aspida”
                            represented essentially anti-monarchy element in armed forces which
                            might be used at a critical moment by its leaders as an instrument of
                            political and/or military pressure against throne. However, <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> is aware that Papandreou is still
                            popular in the country, particularly in rural areas. <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> presumably aware of dangers to
                            monarchy of a struggle at this time with <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> who still has masses with him.</p>

                            Support</p>
                        <p>Possibility always exists that significant segment of party might
                            suddenly withdraw its support of govt and thus bring about Papandreou's
                            fall. Major obstacle to this action is continued popular support for
                            Papandreou, general fear of new elections, and inability of various
                            discordant elements within CU to agree on successor to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. FinMin <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> is recognized as most dynamic
                            in Cabinet but has disadvantage of bitter opposition of liberals in
                            party, led by powerful <hi rend="italic">Vima</hi> newspaper. More
                            likely choice would be De <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, who while not
                            highly regarded, has few real enemies and whose relatively advanced age
                            makes him more acceptable to other ambitious leaders. Some observers
                            believe such attempt might be made this fall, when Cabinet conflict over
                            govt's economic policy, and particularly question of agricultural price
                            supports, may well erupt. Anti- Papandreou forces in govt would prefer
                            to act before <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> could suddenly
                            call for elections to secure new mandate while his popularity still
                            holds. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, of course, would not
                            take revolt against him lying down, and would certainly press <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> for elections. In event <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> refused to proceed to elections,
                            Papandreou might well go to streets to make his case.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>In sum, uneasy atmosphere prevails in Greek political world. Opposition
                            press, taking advantage of Papandreou's troubles, has stepped up
                            intensity of its attacks. These attacks may well concentrate on
                                <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>, who
                            remains <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s most vulnerable
                            point. In <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0453"/>view of this strained
                            atmosphere, further incidents involving army or national security,
                            whether real or contrived, might set off train of events which could
                            threaten Papandreou govt.</p>
                        <p>However, armed with his temporarily invulnerable position vis-à-vis Greek
                            electorate and his undoubted political cunning, Papandreou will probably
                            be able to sustain himself at least during summer months.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In event confrontation does occur, likely outcome would be resignation of
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and his replacement by
                            other member of govt, possibly Deputy <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> and MinCoord <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>. Key question is whether <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> or other political figure
                            could secure sufficient number of votes from own party to form govt.
                            Support of 99 <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> deputies is probable,
                            since most anxious to bring down Papandreou and would likely be willing
                            to support CU govt led by acceptable figure such as <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> for limited time.
                            However, if new vote unable to obtain minimum of 50–60 deputies from CU
                            ranks, then elections would be in offing, despite fact that almost no
                            one (with exception of Papandreou) would want them.</p>
                        <p>Dangerous aspect of current situation twofold: (1) If new election held,
                            Papandreou would in all probability be returned with approximately same
                            strength as at present, and could conceivably receive even stronger
                            mandate. This would be heavy blow to <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s prestige, particularly since Papandreou,
                            supported by left, would possibly make monarchy an issue in elections.
                            (2) If <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> or other CU
                            figure succeeded in forming new govt, Papandreou might go to streets to
                            try bring down such govt. With leftist support, Papandreou would have
                            capacity to provoke serious demonstrations throughout country. At this
                            point army might intervene, fearing that stability of regime were being
                            shaken.</p>
                        <p>Whatever outcome, confrontation at this time (while Papandreou still
                            popular) and on issue of army leadership would appear to be unfortunate
                            step both from point of view U.S. and Greek interests. Even opponents of
                            Papandreou in both govt and opposition ranks believe timing is not right
                            for challenge to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. They
                            maintain that in fall, when economic problems reach critical stage,
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>'s popularity will fall
                            sharply, and challenge to his leadership will then come from within his
                            own party, from <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> forces.
                            However, these anti-Papandreou forces within party might be reluctant to
                            line up with Palace against <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            now. Deputies would not now relish facing alternatives of elections on
                            one hand or participating in coalition supported by <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> on other.</p>
                        <p>Indications are that <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>,
                            undoubtedly under influence of rightwing advisors, believes that his
                            leadership of armed forces is being eroded by army's involvement in
                            politics and by its penetration by forces <pb n="418" xml:id="pg_418" facs="0456"/>loyal to Papandreous (such as Aspida) rather than to
                            throne. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>
                            apparently is being persuaded that he must make stand now, rather than
                            at later time, when his position might be weaker.</p>
                        <p>Embassy remains hopeful that head-on collision will be averted through
                            realization by both sides that confrontation not in their best
                            interests, and we are taking every opportunity to point out that
                            confrontation would be damaging to nation's interests.</p>

                        <p>Now he must face up to problem of taking politics out of the army. This
                            means removing those within army who espoused cause of either right or
                            left. He has therefore decided he must ask for MinDef <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>' resignation within next few
                            days and assume post himself. <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>, in whom he has great trust and who would be
                            highly competent in any other Ministerial post, is unhappily labeled as
                            man of the Palace. <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>
                            strives to protect Palace interests but in order compensate <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> does not act with
                            appropriate vigor toward center elements who require discipline. His

                            <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Gennimatas</persName>, Chief of Staff, had
                            also been labeled as a man of the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> and was also unable to function effectively because
                            he too is under <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0457"/>fire from “the
                            democratic elements”. A new man is needed as Chief HAGS who would not be
                            tarred with this brush and he, the past <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> is going to advise the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> that a change has to be made. He said he thought
                            the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> would agree to this
                            change when he had presented his reasons for it.</p>
                        <p>I said frankly I am concerned at implications of confrontation between
                            Palace and govt over question of military leadership. US interests in
                            stability of Greece as well as our continuing contributions to Greek
                            armed forces are basis legitimate interest in this question. I entirely
                            agreed with <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> that politics should be
                            kept away from armed forces. While I agreed that govt, not <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> is responsible for policy
                            determination, I am also aware that modern Greek history shows clearly
                            that <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> has over period of time
                            acquired a generally recognized interest in armed forces. Any severe
                            shock to this delicate balance of powers could be dangerous and might
                            even risk raising basic issue of regime. This would be tragic for
                            Greece. For this reason I earnestly hope that a solution satisfactory to
                            both parties could be found. I said that I am pleased <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> will soon have occasion to see

                            misunderstandings resulting from reliance on intermediaries. I expressed
                            concern that departure of both <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Gennimatas</persName> might create profound reaction in Palace and

                            was adamant that <persName corresp="#p_GGI1">Gennimatas</persName> as a
                            person would have to go but acknowledged that once agreement had been

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Papandreou was in a very serious mood
                            and showed a degree of stubbornness to my probing as to what the
                            implications of the change in the military hierarchy might mean to the
                            political fabric of Greece. He appears confident he can stand down
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> on this issue and will
                            use the threat of resignation and elections in the event the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> does not agree. He stated flatly
                            no new government based on support of <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> could stand because it would be a travesty of will of
                            people. He did not once mention <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> factor or allude to <persName corresp="#p_KP1">Kokkas</persName> attacks except indirectly, when
                            he said his son Andreas is being blamed for all ills of Greece. He would
                            not be surprised if they were to run out of issues to bomb him for,

                        <p>33. Had long talk with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> last
                            night which began as review discussions on Cyprus but progressed into
                            unexpectedly frank exchange on situation of Greek nationals in Istanbul
                            and Patriarchate.</p>
                        <p>Re talks, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> said dialogue
                            continuing with Sgourdeos but getting nowhere. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> still says it understands necessity for compensation to
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> if agreement to be reached on
                            basis enosis but then says it has nothing to offer.</p>
                        <p>I asked what in circumstances they then had to talk about.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> replied this good question
                            and answer is that, in effort keep talks going, he and Sgourdeos
                            indulging in form of “mental gymnastics” which taking form not of real
                            negotiations but of discussing various aspects of question on purely
                            hypothetical basis. However, this type of shadow discussion could not go
                            on indefinitely and, unless something more promising develops, he will
                            have no alternative but to abandon idea of agreement on enosis and
                            revert to settlement based on independence.</p>
                        <p>In painting this rather bleak picture, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> again mentioned desirability of reaching agreement
                            in order keep issue out of election campaign but did not press point as
                            vigorously as he had before. However, this may have been more end of day
                            fatigue than change of emphasis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> took occasion once again
                            express dissatisfaction with unfulfilled assurances of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to influence <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to improve situation of Turk
                            Cypriots and said improvement in this respect remained essential <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421" facs="0459"/>to successful talks with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. He also referred to various statements
                            and acts of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> which
                            apparently designed impede talks but reemphasized that real problem is
                            situation Turks on island.</p>
                        <p>This led to his observation that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            attempting fan flames of situation of Greek nationals in Istanbul and
                            draw analogy with that of Turk Cypriots, which obviously unreasonable
                            since measures taken re Greeks are normal application of law such as is
                            observed worldwide in situations where residence permits expire. If any
                            analogy to be drawn it should be with Greeks of Turkish nationality
                            whose status not in question.</p>
                        <p>I observed at this point that, without going into question of law, fact
                            is that continuing eviction of Greeks from Istanbul lends itself to
                            highly colored treatment with result that, rightly or wrongly, it does
                            in fact have an impact in Greece similar to that of situation of Turk
                            Cypriots here. Thus it is a practical problem which can affect progress
                            of talks. Viewed purely pragmatically, could not something be done to
                            alleviate this?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> hesitated and then said he
                            did recognize this and had gone ultimate limit in trying do something
                            but that action which would have effect of non compliance with law would
                            provoke reaction far more difficult than existing situation where
                            various means can be used to modify application of law without actually
                            voiding it. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> added he had been
                            frank in saying same thing to Sgourdeos since he believed only hope of
                            successful outcome of negotiations was to lay cards on table.</p>
                        <p>He then added, as though thinking out loud, that perhaps just as well
                            that presence of Greek nationals in Istanbul should be gradually
                            liquidated since, viewed long term, it was constant irritant in
                            Greco-Turk relations. Same could also be true of Patriarchate,
                            especially if present incumbent continued to rely on political support
                            of Greece and also to play international role by exchanging messages,
                            gifts, etc. with heads of state in manner not consonant with his
                            position as a prelate in Turkey. In situation where Turkey had abolished
                            Caliphate as symbol of universal Islam, not permissible that
                            Patriarchate should arrogate role to itself for which Caliph had been
                            deposed.</p>
                        <p>Here again I intervened to suggest that, whereas this might be Turkish
                            position, matter does not necessarily look same from outside where,
                            although understood that Patriarch of Istanbul does not have same
                            authority as Pope, he is nevertheless recognized as first among equals
                            and thus not unnatural that he should be regarded at times as spokesman
                            for Greek Orthodoxy. For instance, was trip of Patriarch to visit Pope
                            at Jerusalem last year inappropriate?<note n="2" xml:id="d198fn2">The
                                Pope and Partriarch met in Jerusalem January 5–6, 1964.</note>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0460"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> admitted that distinction
                            could perhaps be made where contacts were purely religious but he once
                            again stressed that political connections which Patriarch has been
                            maintaining are definitely improper in eyes of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and could lead to removal.</p>
                        <p>I might add that, in cases of both Greeks in Istanbul and Patriarchate,
                            foregoing is my own distillation of long and frank discussion in course
                            of which my probing evoked replies which <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> would hardly have volunteered. Views which he did
                            express, however, even though on personal basis, would indicate that, as
                            prospect of quid pro quo for enosis settlement fades, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will be taking harder look at
                            alternatives.</p>

                            some rumors that <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> prepared to
                            accept government under a military leader if satisfactory government,
                            willing and able to confront demonstrations and strikes which

                        <p>Embassy position has remained unchanged from that which we have taken
                            ever since collision between <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>

                            only the Communists would profit. This position has naturally been
                            received with a lack of enthusiasm by those elements on both sides who

                            reflected similar views. <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> leaders
                            were highly emotional over current situation but revealed very little
                            evidence they had carefully considered all implications of confrontation
                            between <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> and <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> at this time.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> has been isolated in Corfu
                            presumably depending principally upon Queen Mother, his political
                            advisor <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Choidas</persName> and his long-time
                            confidant, Major <persName corresp="#p_AMM1">Arnaoutis</persName>, as
                            advisors and intermediaries. In extensive conversation with <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Choidas</persName> June 23 reported in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 1880 I expressed serious
                            reservations as to wisdom of direct collision between Papandreou and
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> under current
                            circumstances. Since that time I have twice seen him socially. On each
                            occasion he asserted he wished to talk with me again and promised to get
                            in touch with me, but conspicuously failed to do so. I had also
                            expressed my own opinion clearly to General <persName corresp="#p_PGT1">Papathanassiades</persName>, Marshal of the Court, who asserted
                            that he entirely agreed and that he had transmitted not only his own but
                            my views to the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>.</p>
                        <p>My present feeling is that the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> has acted with imprudent haste and abruptness,
                            thereby incurring serious risk to internal stability which might
                            possibly have been avoided. If <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s action results in establishment of relatively
                            stable new government (presumably headed by a Center Union personality
                            depending principally upon <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> support

                        <p>A) Situation has not developed to point where U.S. attitude might be
                            decisive. Consequently we are endeavoring to maintain greatest possible
                            discretion.</p>
                        <p>B) In circumstances where we felt it might be helpful, we have privately
                            expressed view <persName corresp="#p_NG1">Novas</persName> solution
                            which, though not very promising, at least has advantage some declared
                            adherents, would not be prematurely abandoned.</p>
                        <p>C) With regard <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, we
                            have noted this formula depends upon willingness of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, certain other C.U.
                            leaders, and particularly such newspapers as <hi rend="italic">Vima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Nea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Makedonia</hi> to force acceptance this solution on Papandreou or
                            proceed without him. Unless and until support these elements is
                            definitely acquired it would <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0463"/>be
                            dangerous to abandon <persName corresp="#p_NG1">Novas</persName>. In
                            principle we have no objection to <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> or “<persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> plan”, which in theory would preserve a
                            wider measure of unity in C.U.</p>
                        <p>D) We have not demonstrated any enthusiasm for new effort to find
                            compromise between <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> and
                            Papandreou. This would probably leave Papandreou in even more powerful
                            position in C.U. Moreover, it is highly unlikely <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> would consent. We recognize,
                            however, Papandreou may yet emerge victor and that we may have to live
                            with him. We are endeavoring avoid actions which might prejudice U.S.
                            position in this eventuality.</p>
                        <p>Given incredibly sensitive political acoustics in Athens and virtuosity
                            of Greek talent for misrepresentation and distortion, Embassy position
                            is constant subject for local exploitation. For example: <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> has been quoted as saying I
                            discouraged <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> from
                            forming or joining government following Papandreou resignation; rightist
                            elements have charged that U.S. is no longer interested in fighting
                            Communism; <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> told
                            me he knows Americans are saying that he must go. This spectrum of
                            commentary suggests that although our attempt not to become involved may
                            not prove to be completely successful, the effort is at least a valiant
                                one.<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">In telegram 127 to Athens, July 31,

                            even though CU party caucus yesterday afternoon had produced only 26
                            deputies who supported <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> as against 116 who supported Papandreou,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> was <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0464"/>confident <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> would continue his efforts. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> had assured <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>, through <persName corresp="#p_CC1">Choidas</persName>, that he would produce a
                            solution. Palace hoped such solution would be <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>' agreement to accept mandate himself.
                            Embassy's good offices would be appreciated. <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> himself also commented to an American friend
                            yesterday that he hoped Embassy could encourage <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> to move forward.</p>
                        <p>Later in evening [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] and I received visit from CU Deputy Tsouderos.
                            Tsouderos said he had just come from meeting at which <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> and Papapolitis were working very hard to
                            persuade <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> that it is
                            essential he continue his effort. A word of encouragement from Embassy
                            at this point could be extremely important. Tsouderos said there is
                            increasing amount of disgust and unhappiness among 116 deputies who had
                            supported Papandreou yesterday. Although it is not at all certain that
                            all 26 who had supported <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> yesterday would necessarily support him
                            if he proceeded without formal support of CU, there is undoubtedly
                            significant number of deputies who had supported Papandreou who would
                            switch their allegiance if <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>' determination to accept mandate and seek
                            vote of confidence became clear.</p>
                        <p>I acknowledged that if <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> solution failed, other possible solutions
                            are certainly not very attractive. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> is now in awkward position to continue in
                            light his public statements making acceptance of mandate contingent on
                            approval of CU. Moreover, performance of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>' sponsor, <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lambrakis</persName>, and his papers <hi rend="italic">Vima</hi>
                            and <hi rend="italic">Nea</hi> have been extremely disappointing not to
                            say ambiguous. Despite his professed private endorsement of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> plan, it seemed pretty
                            clear <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lambrakis</persName> had in fact done
                            virtually nothing at the last minute to encourage those who might
                            otherwise have been tempted support <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>. Even though <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> succeeded in forming govt and even though
                            an additional thirty or forty CU deputies subsequently adhered to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, serious
                            situation would remain with Papandreous outside govt, resulting de facto
                            popular front. Problem would be particularly awkward if powerful
                                <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lambrakis</persName> press continued
                            support Papandreou. Nevertheless <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> solution still seemed least unattractive
                            and I hoped <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> could
                            be persuaded not to abandon his effort until it is certain he could not
                            succeed. Tsouderos visited <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> after having left us.</p>
                        <p>This morning I received a telephone call from <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>. Asked him how he saw situation and
                            whether he was prepared to continue his effort. He said he would inform
                                <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> at noon today he could
                            not under circumstances accept mandate. I commented it is obvious that
                            solution must be found and asked whether he had any other ideas. He
                            replied that he had, and that he would like to talk with me about them
                            soon.</p>

                            yesterday in CU caucus would be arithmetically sufficient to form a

                            word of encouragement which might just possibly provoke necessary
                            impetus to break current impasse and provide interim political solution.
                            Situation had developed to point where issue apparently hung in balance

                        <p>279. As Greek political crisis enters its fifth week it is becoming
                            increasingly clear that viable solution to present anomaly is nowhere in
                            sight. Even if <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>' effort
                            to form govt is successful—which does not seem too likely as of this
                            writing—country must expect turmoil for months to come.<note n="2" xml:id="d202fn2">On August 14, <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> withdrew from the Center Union. On August
                                18, King Constantine asked him to form a government. He took office
                                on August 20 and was defeated in an August 28 vote of confidence by
                                135 to 159.</note> Whatever govt is formed under present
                            circumstances will undoubtedly be an unstable one, with a razor-thin
                            majority in Parl. If <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>
                            does indeed secure vote of confidence next week, his continuation in
                            power will be dependent on votes of an extremely disparate group,
                            ranging from rightist <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> to his own
                            centre-leftist followers, and will count for support upon such
                            unpredictable personalities as Progressive leader <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> and EPEK head Papapolitis,
                            any one of whom could suddenly pull rug out from under <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> govt by withdrawing
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Even more serious in its effect on political stability is fact that
                            former <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Papandreou and his
                            followers will be touring country, beginning tomorrow, in effort to keep
                            atmosphere as turbulent as possible. Continued demonstrations both in
                            Athens and in provinces are in prospect, creating conditions hardly
                            conducive to serious deliberation by Parl in session. Although
                            demonstrations have been frequent, few have been marked by violence.
                            Eventually serious violence may take place, particularly if Papandreou
                            supporters feel their own strength ebbing. And of course if Papandreou
                            takes to road <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> Party may consider it
                            has to do likewise unless it wishes to leave field to Papandreou
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this prospect of continued political instability comes at
                            time when Greece is facing problems of major dimensions both on domestic
                            and foreign fronts. Although Cyprus has been relatively quiet during
                            first month of Greek political crisis, it is at least questionable
                            whether it will continue to remain so in months ahead. Equally urgent
                            are pressing economic problems, characterized by the continued fall in
                            foreign exchange reserves and an increasing trade imbalance. Business
                            confidence will undoubtedly be deeply shaken if prospects for eventual
                            stable govt do not improve. A govt without a solid foundation—either in
                            Parl or among general public—will hardly be in position to make firm
                            (and probably unpopular) decisions in the coming months.</p>

                        <p>In addition to prospects for continued instability, two aspects of
                            current crisis are particularly disturbing. First is that as result
                            efforts to prevent extension Papandreou's influence into military and
                            security forces, <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> had
                            directly descended into political area with result that the “regime”
                            issue has gradually arisen. And this despite repeated denials of
                            Papandreou that there is any “question of monarchy” involved or that CU
                            would raise it in future elections.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">At a
                                meeting with Embassy officials on August 25, Papandreou reiterated
                                this assurance. (Telegram 304 from Athens, August 25; Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 15–1 GREECE)</note> Anti-royalist
                            sentiment is being continuously inflamed by such pro-Papandreou
                            publications as powerful <persName corresp="#p_LC1">Lambrakis</persName>
                            syndicate (<hi rend="italic">To Vima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ta
                                Nea</hi>) which daily carry attacks on <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>. <hi rend="italic">Vima</hi> for example recently
                            carried editorial critical of <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> under heading: “Crown showing contempt for people.”
                            Slogans chanted and paraded by leftist-led demonstrators for Papandreou
                            are becoming increasingly bold; although initially anti-monarchist
                            slogans concentrated on Queen Mother (“the German woman must go”), in
                            recent days they have included <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> himself. One banner in Aug 17 demonstrations read
                            “people don't want you—take your mother and go.” Thus, regardless of
                            promises of Papandreou camp that they are not raising monarchist issue,
                            in effect it has already been raised.</p>
                        <p>Second disturbing aspect is achievement of extreme left in making its
                            catchwords the slogans of center through its collaboration “at the base”
                            with followers of George Papandreou. For first time since bandit war
                            Communists are no longer isolated but have succeeded in merging at
                            popular level with much larger masses of center. It is difficult to
                            determine what is Communist demonstration and what is not, since slogans
                            have become virtually identical, except that Communists cleverly insert
                            slogans peculiarly their own on such non-Greek topics as Vietnam,
                            “imperialism,” etc. While CU supporters provide bulk of demonstrators,
                            Communists often provide leadership and hence are able to control
                            demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>It seems clear that any long-term solution to current crisis must come
                            through elections, however distasteful this may be to many quarters,
                            including the Palace. As of now Crown maintains (quite rightly) that
                            present climate is completely unsuitable for elections, and electoral
                            campaign in current tense atmosphere would very probably be
                            characterized by serious violence. Even more important from the Palace
                            and conservative point of view, because current tide running in
                            Papandreou's favor, former <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            might well equal his 1964 feat of 53 per cent of popular vote. There are
                            few serious politicians, even in his own party, who would welcome
                            prospect of Papandreou returned with heavy popular vote (which he would
                            consider vindication of his struggle with <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0468"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>) and probably determined to
                            punish those he considered responsible for his troubles in Palace, army,
                            and his own party. Further, a Papandreou victory would not bring with it
                            the tempering influence of more conservative leaders of party such as
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_NG1">Novas</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName>, etc. The influence of his left-leaning son
                            Andreas in govt would undoubtedly be greater with so many of other major
                            figures departed. Further, heavy vote in favor of Papandreou could only
                            be interpreted as blow to <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>,
                            despite Papandreou's denial that monarchy question would be involved;
                            very possibly Papandreou would move to limit role and influence of Crown
                            in Greek political life. Finally, return of Papandreous would probably
                            increase unwholesome political tensions in military and security
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons, <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>, supported
                            by <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>, Progressives and sizeable
                            element of CU, strongly opposes elections, and would consider
                            instability for indefinite period preferable to return of Papandreou.
                            However, as unstable situation continues, pressure for elections from
                            Papandreou will undoubtedly increase and idea might well gain support
                            even among other elements (now opposed to elections) as only available
                            means of clarifying situation.</p>

                        <p>During the period 1965–1967, senior U.S. policymakers, concerned that the
                            return to power of George and <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> could open the door to the radicalization of
                            Greek politics and permit the Communist Party to obtain influence in
                            Greece, debated possible courses of action within the 303 Committee.
                            (Concerning the role of the 303 Committee, see Note on U.S. Covert
                            Actions and Counter-Insurgency Programs, above.) Some officials in the
                                <persName>Johnson</persName> administration believed that the United
                            States should take active steps to strengthen a moderate regime as well
                            as weaken the political base of the Papandreous, leaders of the Center
                            Union Party. The President's Special Assistant for National Security
                            Affairs McGeorge Bundy opposed such a course of action. He contended
                            that reporting on the situation in Greece did not bear out such
                            apprehensions and that political lines were not clearly drawn. The 303
                            Committee first tabled the issue and later, upon considering it a second
                            time and not reaching a decision, referred the matter to Secretary of
                            State <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Dean Rusk</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> rejected such a program because he
                            believed the security risk outweighed any possible gains that could be
                            achieved. Ultimately, the <persName>Johnson</persName> administration
                            endorsed no such programs for Greece.</p>

                            has concluded George Papandreou's return to power should be avoided if
                            this can be done without a direct and open confrontation with him.
                            George Papandreou at this moment commands wide popular support among
                            Greek people. This popularity has temporarily been raised to artificial
                            levels in current crisis by Papandreou's clever exploitation of latent
                            hostility towards the Monarchy. I am keenly aware that inasmuch as we
                            may have to deal with Papandreou again in future, utmost discretion and
                            avoidance of open hostility toward him are essential.</p>
                        <p> Andreas' motives are difficult to present categorically. In my
                            assessment, based on half dozen extensive conversations with him,
                            Andreas is neutralist, ambitious, amoral, and emotionally unstable.
                            Although conclusive proof has not yet been adduced I believe Andreas is
                            probably a leader in Aspida and that he hopes eventually to achieve a
                            measure of control in army which would be exercised as decisive element
                            in Greek political life.</p>
                        <p>In his view the weight of the American position in Greece, political and
                            military, is an obstacle to “independent” foreign and domestic Greek
                            policy which he advocates. I believe Andreas would seek significantly to
                            reduce Greek military expenses, would progressively remove Greece from
                            close <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alignment, look increasingly
                            toward Soviet bloc both as growing market for Greek products (30 per
                            cent of Greek exports now find their way to the Soviet bloc) and as
                            source of aid to fill gap created by decline in Western aid (U.S.,
                                <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> defense support). His natural ally in implementing
                            such a policy is extreme Left and Communists. Explanation of his dubious
                            role in Cyprus issue and his opposition to an active enosis policy may
                            lie in his desire to avoid a position which would be offensive to Soviet
                            Union and Communist elements to whom he seems to be looking for support
                            in other areas. Under these circumstances, it is of great importance to
                            obtain better measure Andreas' relationship Communists and extreme Left,
                            determine sources and magnitude his financial resources, and
                            circumscribe to extent possible his political power, actual and
                            potential.</p>

                        <p>Greece is small, poor country in strategic area of world. Gradual
                            elimination of Western economic aid, reduction of East-West tensions,
                            increased trade between Greece and the bloc, frustration over the Cyprus
                            situation, and current political impasse with its implication for
                            viability of regime itself have all combined create movement of new
                            dimensions in postwar Greek political life. This situation presents new
                            opportunities for Soviet bloc and perhaps other unfriendly forces such
                            as Gaullist France and Red China. Objective evidence such as
                            organization of public manifestations, program of personal threats and
                            intimidation, and rumors regarding substantial funds available to
                            Andreas clearly suggests Communists are not standing aside. Kostopoulos
                            and <persName corresp="#p_ZZ1">Zolotas</persName> have both recently
                            mentioned to me that drachmae resources of Western European banks have
                            mysteriously evaporated.</p>
                        <p>Changing factors in international political life have also reduced
                            somewhat weight of American influence here. We recognize precisely
                            because American influence is slowly declining it must be exercised with
                            increasing caution and discretion. [<hi rend="italic">13 lines of source

                        <p>450. In brief private exchange last night following dinner which King
                            Constantine gave in honor of Astronauts Cooper and Conrad, <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> referred to current political
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> said it imperative <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> succeed in effort form
                            govt although it is not yet quite clear whether <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> has in fact obtained
                            assurances of six or seven additional votes necessary to obtain
                            majority. He suggested that if Embassy had any influence such influence
                            could be terribly important in present circumstances. If current effort
                            to form govt fails it is difficult to know what to do next.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> recognized that even though
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> were to receive
                            vote of confidence, one could not predict how long his govt would last.
                            It is of greatest importance that new govt not be formed on basis of a
                            commitment to hold elections notwithstanding fact elections must
                            eventually be held. It would be most unfortunate if elections were held
                            now on basis of who is right and who is wrong. Important thing is to
                            form govt of ostensibly indefinite duration thereby eliminating
                            prospects of early election which provide Papandreou with hold over
                            substantial number of his deputies. When activities of left have been
                            controlled, electoral system changed, and appropriate situation had been
                            created, quick decision could be taken to hold new elections. <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> expressed opinion elections should
                            be held under proportional system. Although proportional system might
                            strengthen hands of Communists, Communists would be clearly visible and
                            power of Papandreou would also be reduced.</p>
                        <p>I observed that we had always recognized that whatever government might
                            be formed from present Parliament should be regarded as evolutionary,
                            and agree with him that elections must eventually be held. I added I was
                            particularly pleased that records of Crown Council meeting just
                            published had clearly established fact <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> had informed Papandreou on night of Papandreou's
                            resignation that he was prepared to give Papandreou Defense portfolio as
                            soon as Aspida investigation had been concluded and that he was also
                            prepared to accept <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>
                            or any other CU deputy as DefMin pending completion of
                            investigation.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> opened the discussion on
                            Cyprus with the observation that the governmental crisis in Greece had
                            brought efforts to settle the Cyprus question to a standstill. Even with
                            Papandreou in office, there had been only a slim chance of reaching a
                            mutual understanding; now there is no reason to hope for progress. He
                            said he had just spoken with the Greek Ambassador (to the United
                                Nations)<note n="2" xml:id="d207fn2"> Alexis Liatis.</note> who said
                            his government was trying to find a solution. However, it was clear that
                            even with the good intentions of Greek officials, the situation in
                            Greece was not conducive for a settlement. At the same time, <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> said, time is running out. It would
                            be unfortunate if Cyprus developed along the same lines as Kashmir. We
                            must act promptly to prevent this. He said he realizes the United States
                                <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0473"/>Government wants to help
                            find a solution, but it would be helpful to know what the United States
                            now proposes to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> agreed that the present
                            situation in Greece complicates the problem. Any Greek Government for
                            the foreseeable future will be working with a very narrow margin and
                            will not be in a strong position to negotiate. It was the presumption at
                            London that any Greek Government would have to negotiate on the basis of
                            enosis with compensation to Turkey. A weak government in Athens, such as
                            we can expect for some time, would be unable to cede territory. This
                            does make the prospect for settlement very difficult. If we accept the
                            premise that Greece can only negotiate on the basis of enosis, we would
                            have to examine the alternatives. One of these is negotiations between
                            the Turkish Government and the Government of Cyprus, although we
                            recognize this presents difficulties for the Turks, and is, therefore,
                            an unlikely avenue.</p>
                        <p>Being frank, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said it is
                            very difficult to say what the United States might be able to do under
                            these circumstances. We want to see some kind of agreed solution, which
                            is the only kind that could be permanent. Even if we were in a position
                            to bring about a settlement by force, it would be unlikely to be a
                            permanent solution. We had hoped a period of calm on the island would
                            allow an evolution toward some kind of solution. This apparently has not
                            happened. However, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said,
                            we are not entirely clear as to what is happening on the island, or what
                            shape <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' ambitions are
                            taking. He said he would be interested in Mr. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName>'s assessment of the situation and his suggestions
                            as to what the United States might usefully do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> responded that the United
                            States must do its best to avoid a settlement that would not be
                            satisfactory to Turkey. This was the most important element. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is moving continuously toward
                            his objectives. He is always trying to create unrest. Now <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is offering to improve the
                            living conditions of the Turkish refugees. This seems a good sign on the
                            surface, but is really only another attempt to maneuver the Turkish
                            Cypriots into accepting the status of a minority. The Turkish community
                            rejects these blandishments, but individuals, of course, are only human.
                            The Turks have been living under conditions of hardship for a long time,
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' offer will
                            undermine morale in the community. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> said that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' action on the electoral law showed clearly
                            what his real intentions are. But Turkey cannot accept further faits
                            accomplis. We must find a way, he said, to prevent a further
                            deterioration of the situation. If <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> feels he can act, he will continue to move
                            along his present path, and this will prove disastrous. Security lies in
                            preventing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from
                            acting.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> went on to say that Turkey's
                            relations with Greece could not be improved unless the Cyprus problem
                            could be resolved. Turkey and Greece have implicitly agreed to avoid
                            either enosis or partition, unless <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0474"/>as part of a negotiated settlement. Annexation by
                            Greece at this point would result in a direct confrontation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said we had made clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on a number of
                            occasions that we objected to unilateral revision of the London/Zurich
                            Agreements, and we would continue to do so. We have also pointed out to
                            him that if he proceeded with constitutional revisions, this would be a
                            course of action unacceptable to the entire international community and
                            a source of danger. It has been our feeling, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> said, that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has been more cautious after
                            this warning. <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> responded that
                            his actions were cautious but continuous.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> confessed that his Government
                            was at a loss as to how to act under present circumstances. He said he
                            was studying the situation carefully, and was interested in discovering
                            what Turkey and the United States might do together. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> assured <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> that the United States was prepared to do anything
                            possible to facilitate a solution.</p>
                        <p>On the question of Cyprus in the United Nations General Assembly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> commented on the
                            assignment of this issue to the First (Political) Committee. The
                            Committee, he said, would determine when the issue would come up before
                            the Assembly. He said the Turkish Government was working for a
                            “procedural” (non-substantive) resolution. He felt that at least some of
                            the unaligned countries would support such a resolution, although
                            certain of these countries might feel themselves bound by the previous
                            Cairo Conference resolution on Cyprus.<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">The
                                Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries,
                                held in Cairo October 5–10, 1964, issued a declaration that, among
                                other things, called for the “unrestricted and unfettered”
                                sovereignty and independence of Cyprus. For extracts of the
                                declaration, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current

                                    assessment and said he would speak personally with Ambassador
                                        <persName corresp="#p_YCW1">Yost</persName> in New York on

                            </note> The up-coming Afro-Asian Conference in Algiers on October 28
                            might also affect the situation. A non-substantive resolution might be
                            backed by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and other key countries.
                            The attitude of India and the UAR is still unknown. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> felt the chances for a
                            non-substantive resolution were about fifty-fifty at present, but that
                            strong support from the United States and the Latin American countries
                            would ensure success, or at least prevent a resolution favoring
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. The danger,
                                <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> pointed out, is that
                            a resolution might be passed which would seem harmless but could be read
                            by the Greek-Cypriots as a victory. If this were to happen, it would
                            ruin any chance of working out a solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>

                                comments on the Greek aid request. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> 4 GREECE)</note> In past week Embassy has
                            intensively reviewed present political and economic dynamics in Greece
                            and possible instruments available to mitigate adverse trends. While
                            picture has many uncertainties and while indeed our information has many
                            gaps, I have reached following current conclusions:</p>
                        <p>1. Strains on Greek political fabric are more severe today than at any
                            time since recovery from civil war and may not be containable. With far
                            right and, more aggressively, far left nibbling at edges, fractured
                            center is enmeshed in uncompromising power struggle between foxy old
                            Papandreou and those former colleagues who have dared oppose him and son
                            Andreas. As result, Greece is now weakly governed. Nor is any
                            substantially stronger government in prospect.</p>
                        <p>2. Ultimately, this struggle of center forces must be taken to
                            electorate. There is substance, however, in fears held by opponents of
                            Papandreous that election campaign in present tense atmosphere would
                            undermine if not destroy effectiveness of Greek political center for
                            years to come and open field to left-right dichotomy of sort Greece has
                            so calamitously experienced before.</p>
                        <p>3. Key to avoiding that prospect in next few months is ability of present
                            government or one like it to muster support of workable majority of
                            Deputies when Parliament reconvenes November 15. With current 152–148
                            edge tenuously based on alliance of ambitious rivals brought together by
                            common opposition to Papandreou and to immediate elections, it will not
                            be easy for <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> to
                            overcome timidity of other Deputies who are said to want to bolt
                            Papandreou but to fear they would be dead ducks if he succeeded forcing
                            early elections. Outcome depends on confidence current government can
                            generate in its survivability.</p>
                        <p>4. Meanwhile Greece is sliding into sharp double-headed economic strains,
                            on which Embassy has commented in series of recent messages. On
                            international payments front, firm fiscal management, emphasis on import
                            substitutes (e.g., in meat production) and other measures should in long
                            run stand good chance of restoring favorable payments balance on which
                            remarkable Greek development has rested since currency reform of 1953.
                            However, trend of declining reserves in <pb n="438" xml:id="pg_438" facs="0476"/>relation to external obligations probably cannot be
                            corrected this year by measures <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            capable of taking. Serious payments difficulties loom just ahead. I am
                            assured these could gravely undermine confidence of drachma if <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> unable to find necessary financial
                            resources or if accompanied by political turbulence here.</p>
                        <p>5. Condition of domestic economy also causing anxiety as fiscal
                            stringency becomes acute. Seeds of trouble lie in some long-term
                            factors, but are accentuated by uncovered costs of Papandreou economic
                            and social programs and by very large wheat surplus produced by past
                            year's good weather and high subsidies. Administrative immobility
                            reflecting political paralysis of recent months has also had effect.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has already cut back capital
                            development program and may shortly have to interrupt work or at least
                            payments on some ongoing projects unless new resources found. While
                            economy still looks reasonably good to ordinary man, it is in fact
                            highly vulnerable to economic and psychological shocks.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> defense policies and foreign
                            policies do not at present time show signs of deterioration similar to
                            those evident on domestic political and economic fronts. Greece
                            continues to waffle weakly on Cyprus question, but that is old story. A
                            new Cyprus crisis this fall would of course further complicate domestic
                            situation here.</p>
                        <p>7. In sum, Greece faces imminent and heavy pressures on stability and
                            progress achieved in past dozen years. Among limiting and hardly
                            satisfactory political alternatives available, I now believe these
                            pressures would best be resisted by continuation for some months of
                            centrist government without Papandreous. Even if Papandreous should be
                            returned to power in elections sometime in 1966, government then headed
                            by them might be less unsettling to Greece and to our relations with
                            Greece than if they were to ride into office on today's emotional
                            tides.</p>
                        <p>8. As indicated above, I believe there is small hope of averting
                            political crisis unless measures taken to contain worst of economic
                            strains. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has already committed
                            itself to some difficult steps, e.g., its decision to substitute 100,000
                            tons of wheat for imported corn feed. Officials tell us <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is cranking up to take other steps
                                (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 644),<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">Dated October 19. (Ibid., <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss> (US) 15–11 GREECE)</note> but within life
                            expectancy of present <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> these at best
                            will be ameliorative rather than corrective. Effectiveness of such
                            measures may in fact depend, as <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            argues, on Greece's ability to get some external assistance. I believe
                            any such aid at this stage should be precisely focussed on immediate
                            fiscal and economic problems. Its object would be to get prompt economic
                            effect and to indicate continued sympathetic interest in Greece. It
                            would thus improve psychological climate in which <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> government struggling to
                            meet most urgent problems, but if <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0477"/>well handled would not cost us influence with
                            successors if <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> govt
                            should subsequently be overthrown. Ensuing paragraphs discuss
                            possibilities and identify those I recommend.</p>
                        <p>9. To ease balance of payment strains, neither imports nor exports look
                            amenable to constructive manipulation in short term. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has focussed on getting USAID program
                            loan as tidiest instrument among available levers to meet combined
                            problem of international payments, drachma shortage in investment
                            budget, and psychic requirement to avert slump in confidence of traders
                            and money market. Greeks have considered but, as Department knows,
                            strongly resisted drawing <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> tranche on
                            grounds it would have reverse psychological impact. (<persName corresp="#p_ZZ1">Zolotas</persName> says <gloss target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss> staff agrees.) I am not sure they have yet looked hard
                            enough at possibility of getting relief this winter through arrangements
                            with Exim, World Bank or <gloss target="#t_OECD1">OECD</gloss>
                            consortium. In view of urgency of problem, Embassy urging <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to explore all possibilities, not just
                            US program loan, and to apply any measure of discipline permitted by
                            exigencies of situation. I do not yet see how <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can overcome short-term payments crunch and would
                            welcome Dept's suggestions.</p>
                        <p>10. To meet growing shortage of drachmae available for upcoming
                            commitments, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can choose one or
                            mixture of several courses: moratorium on new capital works and
                            slow-down of current capital budget projects, cut in military outlays,
                            or negotiations of new drachma-generating loans. Naturally it is looking
                            to latter, though capital works will also be slowed.</p>
                        <p>11. On particular problem of grain production and needs, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is progressing with plans for handling
                            a considerable part of its wheat surplus by designating 150,000 tons for
                            distribution in mountain villages, 1,000,000 tons for poultry and
                            livestock feeding, and remainder for sale abroad. Ultimately several
                            hundred thousand tons likely be sold to foreign buyers, with good chance
                            that bloc countries will take substantial part. Best estimate of Ag
                            Attaché is that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> cannot in any
                            circumstances succeed in coming year in displacing as much as 100,000
                            tons of corn with wheat for feed. Thus in Embassy's judgement <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will require 200,000 tons of imported
                            corn to meet needs of starch, poultry and cattle producers.</p>
                        <p>12. Taking all factors into account, I recommend following <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decisions as urgent next steps to help
                            limit risks of major political or economic turbulence this winter and to
                            encourage constructive trends without assuming responsibility for costs
                            of mistaken past Greek policies:</p>
                        <p>A. As sole practical economic gesture at this time, to offer 150,000 tons
                            of corn by PL 480 sale Title IV plus 50,000 tons under “usual marketing”
                            to meet full requirements of starch industry and about one half
                            requirements of poultry and livestock producers heretofore met by corn.
                            Details of suggested agreement spelled out in separate telegram. This
                                <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0478"/>action if taken promptly
                            would help <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> hold down payments
                            deficit and meet substantial part of producers' demands for traditional
                            feedgrains while forcing Greeks to start adapting to soft wheat as
                            feedgrain. It would hopefully be read as sign of continued US belief in
                            and encouragement of Greece. To produce maximum political and economic
                            effect I urge that such agreement be concluded or intention to conclude
                            such agreement be announced before convening of Parliament on November
                            13.</p>
                        <p>B. To examine carefully with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> all
                            likely sources of prompt international financial assistance other than
                            USAID loans and to support reasonable Greek requests of prospective
                            lenders.</p>
                        <p>C. To begin consideration of direct US concessional loans, with
                            expectation decision could be made as situation evolves further in
                            coming weeks.</p>
                        <p>D. To postpone consideration of Greek feelers for invitation to <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> to visit Washington until we see
                            situation after Parliament reconvenes and after <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> considers Cyprus (unless, as now seems highly
                            unlikely, Greeks in meantime come up with new ideas on Cyprus that we
                            would wish to discuss with them).</p>
                        <p>E. To tidy up certain requests we have pending with Greeks. With
                            agreement for <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> Gamma site now
                            confirmed by <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>
                            government, top priority is settling marathon joint-use land issue. To
                            avoid further encroachments and other difficulties, I strongly recommend
                            we request <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> promptly expropriate
                            these lands with costs to be borne by <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. Acquisition of additional 27 acres for use for
                            personnel housing at USAF base at Heraklion is also pressing need. By
                            acting promptly we can profit from present readiness <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to be accommodating and at same time US
                            dollar payments involved in these transactions would provide additional
                            foreign exchange for Greek reserves.</p>

                            earlier discussion in US re Cyprus, and remarks of Turkish officials
                            during Ambassador's initial calls. We have also taken into account
                            helpful suggestions contained in Nicosia's 172 to Dept and attitude of
                            Greek Government as reported by Embassy Athens. Against this background,
                            it seems to us that major elements in current situation are
                            following:</p>
                        <p>1. It is improbable that bilateral Greek-Turkish talks will be resumed
                            before <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> Cyprus debate despite
                            Turkish efforts to renew discussions.</p>
                        <p>2. Turks believe they have commitment from us to support procedural
                            resolution at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Even assuming US as
                            well as possible Soviet support, Turks are concerned that majority of GA
                            will approve substantive resolution, perhaps including reference to
                            “self determination” for endorsement of Galo Plaza report.</p>
                        <p>3. Looking beyond <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> vote, over which
                            Turks have limited control, indications are that <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> is anxious to try to achieve
                            early resolution of Cyprus question so that he can devote his attention
                            to Turkey's domestic problems. Compared with predecessor coalition
                            government, he will head strongest Turkish Government since 1950's and
                            thus will possess somewhat greater margin of flexibility. However, area
                            of maneuver open to <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> will
                            remain small because he perforce will operate within familiar framework
                            of Turkish national interests and also be ever sensitive to question of
                            Turkey's prestige.</p>
                        <p>4. In contrast to greater political stability in Turkey, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> government's future seems
                            doubtful. From our perspective, in view heightened Greek-Turkish tension
                            which will probably intensify during <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> debate, it seems probable that in immediate future no
                            Greek Government will be able to consider new initiatives re Cyprus
                            which would require any concession. Consequently, enosis-Greek
                            territorial compensation formula appears shelved.</p>
                        <p>5. On Cyprus itself, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            internal position apparently remains strong despite possibly weaker
                            international position as reflected in August UNSC action and Soviet
                            shift in direction of Turkey. Archbishop appears even less subject to
                            Athens' influence than before, fact which Turks would now be willing to
                            concede, and he remains determined to block any externally imposed
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>6. Given political situation in three countries directly involved, and
                            prospect of residual bitterness after <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> vote, US initiative probably will be required to move
                            Cyprus issue off dead center.</p>
                        <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0482"/>
                        <p>On basis <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName>'s conversations in
                            Washington and Ambassador's discussions here with <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName>, it is clear that Turks are still anxious to
                            engage us in some type of joint planning, although they have no specific
                            proposals in mind.</p>
                        <p>In order partially to meet Turkish desire without actually becoming
                            involved in joint planning, they believe some merit in our exchanging
                            views with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> on informal basis. We
                            might begin by reviewing with Turks various alternative proposals,
                            including those which have been considered before, with objective of
                            determining parameters of Turkish position. To create atmosphere of
                            mutual confidence it would be advisable to hold talks in secrecy while
                            making clear to Turks that no commitments on our part were involved
                            during preliminary exchanges.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, we believe conversations with Turks should begin by
                            explaining alternatives rather than on basis of US-drafted general
                            outline of reasonable proposal (Nicosia's 172 to Dept), but we should be
                            prepared put forward such an outline if talks evolve in fruitful
                            direction. Talks should begin in Ankara on bilateral basis because it is
                            highly unlikely that Turks would be willing to agree to Nicosia as focus
                            of talks involving Archbishop, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>, Greek, Turkish and US
                            Embassies. In addition to Turkish belief that Cyprus issue should be
                            resolved primarily between Ankara and Athens, Turks would fear their
                            interests would not be properly protected in Nicosia where they would be
                            represented only by charge, who would be operating in Greek-Cypriot
                            dominated environment, subject to influence by unreliable
                            Turkish-Cypriot community, and out of direct control of Ankara.</p>
                        <p>Parallel with informal talks in Ankara, we might wish to consider similar
                            noncommittal bilateral exchanges in Athens and Nicosia, informing all
                            three governments that we were carrying on informal exploratory talks in
                            other capitals but that US did not view its role as mediatory one.
                            Instead, our task would be to try to determine whether there was any
                            possibility of forward motion on Cyprus issue by talking independently
                            to parties involved.</p>
                        <p>Depending on progress made in talks in Ankara (and possibly Athens and
                            Nicosia), we could decide whether there was any prospect for direct
                            negotiation between interested governments in light of prevailing
                            circumstances. It might, for instance, be desirable to encourage
                            resumption of Athens-Ankara dialogue building upon conversations which
                            US had previously undertaken with two governments. At that point, it
                            could also be decided how and when <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> might be brought into picture. We are inclined
                            to agree with Embassy Nicosia's view that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should be brought into discussions in early
                            stage so that he does not remain aloof only to sabotage ultimate
                            solution. Turks would remain skittish about including Archbishop in any
                            discussions but their final attitude would hinge upon prospects of
                            satisfactory settlement, <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0483"/>rather
                            than upon principle involved, and they might be willing to include
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if apparent that
                            weak Greek Government could not deliver. Throughout proposed preliminary
                            discussions with Turks (and possibly with others), we would remain alert
                            to desirability of injecting third party into discussions at appropriate
                            time. This could be done by again calling for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention. Despite Turks' unhappy experience with
                            Galo Plaza, or possibly through Acheson type arrangement.</p>

                        <p>Reporting on my conversation with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> at The Hague, I said Under Secretary had reaffirmed
                            US intention to support procedural resolution on Cyprus. Under Secretary
                            had stated that, in his judgment, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                            not the place in which seek change in treaties. Treaties should be
                            reviewed and renegotiated by parties involved; otherwise, agreed
                            solution unlikely. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> also
                            had reiterated view that US is prepared to support any settlement of
                            Cyprus problem which Turkey and Greece can negotiate bilaterally and get
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept. I
                            explained that my stopover visit in Athens had given me opportunity to
                            talk with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> whose
                            position was similar to mine in that both were in process of settling in
                            and obtaining briefings from our respective staffs. While neither of us
                            was therefore yet in position to speak with much local experience, we
                            found it very useful to explore all aspects of Cyprus problem. In this
                            connection, I emphasized that Embassy staffs in Athens and Ankara were
                            of one mind in their desire to seek constructive solution to Cyprus
                            question and that we did not have separate approaches to problem. (I did
                            not go into any details of my Athens discussions.)</p>
                        <p>I then told <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> our <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Mission had been instructed to discuss
                            with Turkish Del plans for handling Cyprus item in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>. Tactical matters re handling Cyprus
                            question would have to be left to these New York delegations but I
                            wanted FonOff to be aware of instructions sent out delegation. After I
                            had drawn on relevant portions reftel, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> expressed gratitude for being filled in on my
                            talks in Athens and The Hague and for reaffirmation of strong U.S.
                            support for Turkish approach. Line of joint action which U.S. envisaged
                            at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seemed well designed to avoid
                            complications which might result from unsatisfactory resolution. In
                            particular, Turks appreciated U.S. desire to work closely with Turkish
                            Delegation in seeking passage of procedural resolution which, he hoped,
                            would prepare the way for subsequent Greek-Turkish bilateral talks. He
                            was grateful U.S. would work to prevent any reference to Galo Plaza
                            report because inclusion such reference would be heralded as victory for
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In ensuing conversation, <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TI1">Turkmen</persName> made following
                            specific requests for U.S. cooperation and support in our joint efforts
                            to obtain satisfactory procedural resolution.</p>
                        <p>1. In addition to expressed U.S. willingness to work particularly with
                                <gloss target="#t_WE1">WE</gloss> and LA Delegations to avoid
                            endorsement Galo Plaza report, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> hoped
                            U.S. would exert similar efforts with other friendly countries.</p>
                        <p>2. U.S. might wish to take somewhat stronger line re Galo Plaza report
                            than statement that we considered <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            endorsement of report as “undesirable”. For example, U.S. might
                            emphasize that reference to report might lead to “serious complications”
                            in terms ultimate settlement Cyprus question.</p>
                        <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0485"/>
                        <p>3. It would be helpful if U.S. could keep in close contact with U.K.
                            Delegation because Turks somewhat worried about firmness of British
                            position. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had received memorandum
                            from British regarding <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> handling of
                            Cyprus issue which, although otherwise satisfactory, contained reference
                            to Galo Plaza report—a reference which perhaps was included because of
                            Galo Plaza's favorable comments re British bases. On the other hand,
                            British had not mentioned Galo Plaza report in discussions of Cyprus in
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> hoped U.S. could persuade British to
                            drop all reference to this report.</p>
                        <p>4. In his annual report,<note n="4" xml:id="d211fn4">For extracts, see

                            report as forming “reasonable basis” for settlement. Turks considered
                            such statement prejudicial and felt <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            should have remained neutral. In addition, they had received reports U
                            Thant had been in touch with Ghanaians re possible Ghanaian initiative
                            and they were also concerned that U Thant was being adversely influenced
                            on Cyprus issue by senior officials in Secretariat. Consequently, it
                            would be helpful if U. S. could express its views on Galo Plaza report
                            to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> as well.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> said that when he was
                            recently in New York with former FonMin <persName corresp="#p_IH1">Isik</persName> their appraisal of prospects for satisfactory
                            Cyprus resolution was rather bright. However, one could never be certain
                            about firmness of number of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            delegations because probably more than one-half of delegations had
                            luxury of “playing” with their instructions. Turks believed compromise
                            resolution would ultimately prevail in New York and would pave way for
                            future Athens-Ankara talks but initially they needed to introduce their
                            own substantive resolution for tactical reasons and because of Turkish
                            public opinion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> possessed no definite information
                            regarding timing or substance of Cypriot substantive resolution.
                            Presumption was that it would be similar to earlier Cairo resolution in
                            calling for “unfettered independence” for Cyprus and, in addition,
                            endorsement of Galo Plaza report. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            could not accept any resolution which suggested that enosis was possible
                            now or in future, that Turkish Cypriots had minority status, or that
                            Galo Plaza report should form basis for Cyprus settlement. They had been
                            informed that way was being paved for introduction by a non- aligned
                            country of satisfactory procedural resolution but cooperation between
                            our two delegations was most important. On basis information I had
                            conveyed to him re instructions to our delegations in New York, he would
                            ask Turkish PermRep Eralp to coordinate his activities and tactics
                            closely with U.S. Del.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>'s forthcoming policy
                            statement had been drafted with great care and was quite moderate
                            despite “vilification” campaign against Turkey in Greece. Turks did not
                            wish disturb prospects of talks between two countries and, consequently,
                            statement drafted for <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> was
                            balanced one which left way open for resumption Athens-Ankara dialogue.
                            I replied that I was glad to hear this because attitude in Greece, as
                            reflected in press, was that Turks were putting pressure on Greeks
                            particularly in Istanbul. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName>
                            commented that there was nothing new in Istanbul situation and that
                            question of Greek citizens there was being handled routinely. He
                            concluded by expressing opinion that <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> government planned to pursue moderate policy
                            toward Greece but its ability to do so would depend upon actions of
                            Cyprus and Greece. Efforts of Greek Government to exploit religion for
                            political purposes were not helpful in this regard.</p>

                        <p>I told <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> I had read text of both
                            resolutions and understood Afghan-Iraqi resolution had precedence. I
                            also had observed obvious flaws in 24-nation resolution. As <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> aware, U.S. was supporting <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> in seeking adoption of procedural
                            resolution and I was certain that our two delegations in New York were
                            in close touch in pursuit this objective. While I had no concrete
                            suggestions, it seemed to me it might be possible to make certain
                            adaptations in the Afghan-Iraqi resolution which would draw support from
                            24-nation proposal. However, tactics could best be handled in New
                            York.</p>
                        <p>In response my inquiry as to whether he had received any report re
                            support for Afghan-Iraqi resolution, <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> replied in negative, adding he hoped to receive
                            information soon. His main concern was that 24-nation resolution not
                            pass because resolution was in violation <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and existing agreements. I recalled we had
                            previously informed <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> we did not
                            consider <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appropriate place to change
                            agreements between parties and reaffirmed that our respective
                            delegations in New York would be in close contact. <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> said he understood this was case
                            but wished Turkish Government's views to be known directly through me as
                            well as through Turkish <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegation,
                            and he was confident U.S. would not fail to assist Turkey in heading off
                            24-nation resolution. I replied that within framework of our common
                            objectives, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> could be assured
                            two delegations would be working together for procedural resolution.</p>

                            The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> cited a serious
                            deterioration of the economy in the “last months” and expressed concern

                            of a psychological and more general nature” could lead to a full-scale
                            crisis that would undermine the social stability of Greece. The

                        </list>
                        <p>On November 23, 1965, an Embassy officer and his wife attended a small
                            dinner at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Westebbe. The only other
                            guests were Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> and Center Union Deputy Nikolaos Kountouris,
                            an enthusiastic Papandreou supporter. Upon extending the invitation to
                            the Embassy officer, Westebbe clearly implied that the evening had been
                            specifically arranged to provide young Papandreou with an opportunity to
                            explain and justify his position to an American official. Papandreou's
                            comments during the course of the wide-ranging five-hour conversation
                            were as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Greek Economy:</p>
                        <p>Admittedly, Greece's present economic difficulties stem in some measure
                            from mistakes made by the Center Union Government while it was in power.
                            Chief among these are the tax reductions sponsored by former Finance
                            Minister Konstantine Mitsotakis, which have cost the government some
                            1,200,000,000 drachmae in lost revenues. These tax reductions were
                            instituted against the strong recommendations, in writing, of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>. A second factor was
                            the failure to obtain economic assistance through the Consortium.
                            Particularly disappointing in this regard was the fact that the French,
                            after offering a $25 million credit, imposed severe conditions and set
                            exorbitant prices for locomotives, machinery, etc., which the Greeks
                            wanted.</p>
                        <p>Despite these difficulties, Greece's economic problems would now be well
                            on the way to solution had the Center Union Government remained in
                            power. When the Center Union was replaced in mid-July, <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> was on the verge of
                            consummating arrangements for the floating of a long-term, low-interest
                            bond issue through commercial banks in West Germany, which probably
                            could have put the Greek economy “over the hump” and on the road to
                            healthy growth.</p>
                        <p>The present government is incapable of coping with the economic situation
                            for a number of reasons. The individual ministers are not cooperating,
                            and few of them are professionally competent; public confidence<pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0490"/> has been severely shaken as a
                            result of political and economic instability and uncertainty; the
                            problem of agricultural surpluses is being badly mismanaged; and strikes
                            and disruptive labor unrest will probably have a serious effect.</p>
                        <p>In the latter connection, labor problems during the period of the
                            Papandreou government were kept to a minimum because labor leaders
                            realized the government understood and sympathized with their position,
                            and it was possible for members of the government—particularly <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> himself—to persuade
                            the trade unions to refrain from strikes. Andreas could do this because
                            the union leaders trusted him, and he in turn fully understood their
                            problems. There is no one in the present government who enjoys this kind
                            of relationship with the trade union movement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Political Conditions:</p>
                        <p>Because of the foregoing economic conditions, internal divisions, and
                            lack of public confidence, the Stefanopoulos Government cannot long
                            survive—certainly not for more than a few months. If elections were held
                            today, the Center Union would get perhaps 60% of the popular vote,
                                <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> no more than 30%, and the
                            “traitors” (Stefanopoulos supporters) a bare 10%. The <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> vote would be negligible—maybe
                            5%—because the Center Union would win the support of all but a very
                            small Communist hard core within <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The overwhelming and durable political strength of the Center Union, as
                            presently constituted and oriented, stems from four basic issues which
                            preoccupy the electorate:</p>
                        <p>a. The need for social and economic reform.</p>
                        <p>b. The necessity to restore civil liberties and restrain the arbitrary
                            and oppressive activities of the police.</p>
                        <p>c. Keen national “sensitivity” regarding certain infringements on Greek
                            sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>d. A strong and mounting resentment against recent activities of the
                            Palace.</p>
                        <p>Item c above—the “sensitivity” regarding sovereignty—is something the
                            Americans should understand. It stems from the widespread feeling that
                            through its participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>,
                            Greece has surrendered certain elements of national independence.
                            Although it is recognized that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            served a useful purpose initially, in more recent years Greece's
                            membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has entailed some
                            loss of autonomy in such matters as the selection and assignment of

                            account. Simply <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0491"/>because Greece

                            of sovereignty are concerned. The Greek attitude is much the same as
                            that currently being expressed by <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de
                                Gaulle</persName>, whose position has wide appeal in Greece.</p>
                        <p>The question of the Palace is another extremely important factor. Public
                            resentment again the <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s
                            recent “interference” in political affairs has now reached massive
                            proportions. Andreas and other Center Union politicians have noted in
                            their recent travels a significant change in this regard. Whereas prior
                            to last July there was considerable anti-monarchist sentiment, it was
                            usually expressed by the man in the street in such terms as: “When will
                            King Constantine abdicate and go to Denmark?” Now the question is more
                            likely to be: “When will Constantine be brought to trial for his
                            crimes?” Until recently it had been the popular assumption that the
                            young <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName>'s misdeeds were the
                            result of the influence of his mother, but now it is becoming clear that
                            he is acting on his own responsibility and should be held accountable
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_KGD1">King</persName> should realize that his
                            position can only be saved by the Center Union Party, without which the
                            political situation would become increasingly polarized between right
                            and left, with the left by far the stronger faction and heavily
                            committed to the abolition of the monarchy. If a plebiscite were held
                            today on the regime issue, the anti-monarchists would draw some 70 to
                            80% of the vote.</p>
                        <p>Any effort to frustrate the continuation of the “peaceful revolution”
                            which the Center Union, under the elder Papandreou, was in the process
                            of carrying out will have dangerous consequences. “Progressive and
                            democratic” forces in the country are on the march in quest of a more
                            modern and liberal order and will not long tolerate efforts to obstruct
                            their progress. In addition to popular internal pressures, there is
                            another reason why “undemocratic” regimes such as the present
                            Stefanopoulos government cannot survive. This is the presence on
                            Greece's northern frontiers of powerful neighbors who are “not
                            indifferent” to developments in Greece. The United States should not
                            assume that Greece exists in a vacuum, or that the U.S. can freely and
                            unilaterally manipulate the Greek political situation without creating
                            “reactions” in other quarters.</p>
                        <p>It is the firm view of the overwhelming majority of the Greek people that
                            the U.S. is aligned with the extreme right, the Palace, and the
                            military. This may not be entirely true, especially at the moment, but
                            it is nevertheless a deeply held belief and there is evidence to support
                            it. For example, it is assumed that articles last summer in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> by C.L. Sulzberger, highly
                            critical of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> and
                            his father, were a fair reflection of the U.S. view and were probably
                            inspired by U.S. officials.<note n="2" xml:id="d214fn2">

                            evening Andreas, who dominated the conversation, was amiable, responsive
                            to questions, and apparently intent on giving an impression of candor.
                            He professed to welcome an opportunity for a frank exposition of his
                            views which, he implied, had sometimes been misunderstood in American
                            official circles. He said he knew he had been accused of having been a
                            leftist and even a Marxist, but in fact he considered himself neither a
                            rightist nor a leftist but a professional economist, now a politician,
                            who tried to approach all political and economic problems analytically
                            and objectively. His conversation was lucid and his points were well
                            organized. In fact, he gave the impression that some of his remarks may
                            have been planned or rehearsed in advance.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the evening Kountouris dutifully echoed Andreas' main points.
                            Mrs. Papandreou was generally noncommittal. Westebbe tried to play the
                            role of mediator, sometimes siding with Andreas and sometimes defending
                            the American position.</p>

                        <p>After an exchange of courtesies had established a cordial atmosphere,
                            Caglayangil opened the discussion (<persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> translating) with a statement of the new
                            Government's emphasis on strengthening relations with the United States
                            and the West. He mentioned that the Justice Party had received a
                            substantial majority which would permit a stable government for the next
                            four years. There has been a tendency in Turkey, made possible by
                            increased freedom of the press, toward a more neutral foreign policy and
                            toward leftism. The result of the recent elections indicates, however,
                            that the great majority of Turkish people do not approve of tendencies
                            that would take Turkey away from its traditional policies or, in the
                            guise of social justice, move the country to the far left. The Justice
                            Party won on the basis of a clear platform, and the people of Turkey
                            have defined their leadership and the policies they want to have
                            followed.</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil said that the democratic system has many opportunities but
                            also has some inherent disadvantages. The Turkish Government,
                            Caglayangil went on, has decided to make every effort to preserve and
                            improve United States-Turkish relations. He is sure the United States
                            will do its part to ensure that the relationship is not harmed by these
                            (leftist) tendencies. If the relationship is not to be damaged, both
                            countries must keep these tendencies in perspective.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was encouraged that the Turkish people had made
                            such a clear-cut decision, and that there was a good prospect for a
                            political continuum. He said the new Government need have no doubt about
                            our concern for Turkish stability and well-being. This was a stable
                            concern, as it was based on our own self-interest and on our
                            commitments, which we value and intend to honor.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> PL 480</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil said he would be grateful if something could be done to
                            accelerate work on a new surplus agreement, as progress was now very
                            slow. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CGT1">Churchill</persName> explained
                            that a rather technical discussion was going on within the United States
                            Government to determine what commodities might be delivered, and also on
                            the question of export restrictions. Since the Turkish Government had
                            indicated it wanted export restrictions eliminated or reduced in the new
                            agreement, we were trying to determine what flexibility might be allowed
                            under the legislation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would involve himself personally in this matter. He
                            said he was seeing Secretary <persName corresp="#p_Freeman1">Freeman</persName> December 3.<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">No
                                record of the meeting has been found.</note> The Secretary added
                            that the surplus situation in the United States was changing. We don't
                            have the same stockpile as before. Wheat has dropped, and rice is in
                            short supply. We will continue to take into account the needs of other
                                <pb n="456" xml:id="pg_456" facs="0494"/>countries, but the changing
                            supply situation will affect what we can do in the future with PL
                            480.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Military Assistance</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil said he knows that the concerned authorities in the United
                            States have the whole military assistance problem under review, but he
                            wanted to stress Turkey's need for all-weather aircraft and Hawk
                            missiles.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that we planned to give substantial support for
                            Turkey's military program. However, there are a couple of difficulties
                            that arise, both attributable to Vietnam: (a) the problem of
                            appropriations—our “bank balance” is overdrawn because of Vietnam; and
                            (b) the question of types of equipment available. We are in a war in
                            Vietnam and cannot be entirely sure where it will lead. This means we
                            cannot clearly determine what our own equipment requirements will be,
                            and thus what will be available for others. The Secretary said he did
                            not mean this as a negative response, but only as an indication of the
                            complications involved.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Economic Situation</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil stressed the importance the new Government places on planned
                            development and the achievement of a self-sustaining economy through
                            self-help. He was sure the United States would do everything possible to
                            help achieve these goals. The Secretary said we were encouraged by
                            development results in Turkey so far. He urged that the Turkish
                            Government extend its own diplomacy to the limit in talking to other
                            Consortium members. He said we would, of course, continue to do our
                            part, but our approaches to the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, FRG,
                            and others may carry less weight than the Turks' own efforts, since we
                            are pressing these countries all the time on so many issues.</p>

                        <p>According to Caglayangil, Turkey participates in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in the sincere belief that this organization has been
                            successful in achieving its primary missions in the past and will
                            continue to be useful in the future. Developments within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> should be participated in by all
                            member countries. It is the Turkish Government position that a
                            directoire should not be formed within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital"> USSR Relations</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil stated that the Turkish Government is interested in
                            establishing good neighbor relations with the Soviet Union, according to
                            the principles laid down by Ataturk. However, Turks do not forget that
                            Turkey has been at war with the Russians thirteen times in the past.
                            Since every war sets a country back fifty years in economic development,
                                <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0495"/>Caglayangil said, Russia
                            bears a large responsibility for Turkey's present underdeveloped state.
                            The emphasis in Turk-USSR relations will be on the development of trade.
                            The Secretary said we do not object to our allies having normal
                            relations with the USSR. Specifically, we support the idea of Turkey's
                            normalizing relations with Russia. However, the USSR could conceivably
                            cause difficulties again in the future. If relations again become
                            abnormal because of Russian pressure, we would share Turkey's interest
                            in restoring the situation.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Cyprus</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil identified two phases of the Cyprus problem: (a) the
                            immediate issues in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss>, and (b)
                            the substantive problem of finding an ultimate solution. On the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> phase, Caglayangil said that if the
                            “Cypriot” resolution drafted by 24 United Nations members were accepted,
                            it would give encouragement to the Greek Cypriots and will ensure
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' freedom of action
                            for further faits accomplis. Although the present Turkish Government is
                            firmly in power, it does have a responsibility to the Turkish public and
                            cannot ignore public opinion, especially in an issue of national
                            importance, such as Cyprus. Caglayangil said that the adversary in this
                            instance (the Cypriot Government) has an ever-changing policy. Now they
                            are for full independence; but last month they were for enosis. They
                            talk about human rights, but deprive the Turkish community of every
                            right and treat them as rebels. Therefore, Caglayangil said, the Turkish
                            Government is concerned that any resolution which might look like a
                            political victory for the adversary might bring about disastrous
                            consequences. Despite Turkey's desire for restraint, it might prove
                            necessary to act, in the face of the Greek-Cypriot attitude.</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil continued that even if a procedural resolution is adopted in
                            the United Nations, the problem of finding an ultimate solution remains.
                            After the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> debate, Caglayangil said, he
                            hoped Turks and Americans could join to search out the alternatives, to
                            look at each one and to find the best, so that an optimum solution could
                            be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWB1">Buffum</persName> agreed that the 24
                            member draft resolution was not acceptable, and said we were working for
                            a procedural resolution. On the longer range aspect, the Secretary said
                            the Cyprus question is full of agony for everybody. If it could be
                            settled without us, we would be very happy. Our basket is already full!
                            However, we are prepared to be helpful, and we would be glad to have a
                            serious discussion in depth if the Turks would find it helpful.</p>
                        <p>Responding to the Secretary's query about possibilities for resumed
                            Greek-Turkish talks, Caglayangil said the Turkish Government had always
                            favored bilateral talks, but he was not sure about the Greek Government.
                            There are indications that the Greeks may want to resume, but there is
                            no way of knowing when or how they plan to start. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>
                            <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0496"/>came to a Turkish cocktail
                            party in New York and talked to Caglayangil for a few minutes, but
                            showed no inclination to talk substance. The Secretary said he would
                            talk to <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> in Washington
                            next week and would explore this question again in Paris at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BGW1">Ball</persName> commented that the Greek-Turkish
                            talks were first started as a result of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial in May, and that perhaps they could be
                            revived at the December meeting.</p>

                        <p>In the December 8 meeting between the Secretary and Greek Deputy Prime
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> the Cyprus
                            issue came up briefly in the beginning in connection with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>' remarks about being
                            reluctant to go to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> meeting
                            until the Cyprus debate in the <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> was
                            concluded. He declared in this regard that his side was prepared to meet
                            the Turks at any time to discuss Cyprus, but the Turks seemed to be
                            making threats and, in general, waging a war of nerves. He did not
                            understand their reasons for doing this but it was having an adverse
                            effect on public opinion in Greece. In response to a query from the
                            Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>
                            <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0497"/>said the Greek Parliament would
                            be in session in case there should be talks soon.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> asked the Secretary for
                            his comments on a Cyprus <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution.
                            The Secretary referred this to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BWB1">Buffum</persName> who explained that we believe a procedural
                            resolution would be desirable and that the Afghan-Iraqi resolution comes
                            near to meeting our viewpoint, though it has some obvious defects; for
                            example, we would not like to see a call for “new” mediation which might
                            change the thrust of the earlier Security Council resolution.</p>
                        <p>Tsirimokis stated that, in his view, a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            resolution alone would not bring a final solution to the problem but
                            could have an important influence on future negotiations by the way it
                            was worded. At the moment each side had its own text which it felt
                            strongly partisan about, but behind the texts there were ulterior
                            motives. The idea of new mediation represented Turkish opposition to the
                            person of Galo Plaza. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>
                            asserted that he favored mediation but had no preference as far as the
                            person of the mediator was concerned. He noted that, since there was a
                            Security Council resolution which clearly provided for mediation, the
                            Secretary General could change the mediator for reasons of illness or
                            other reasons and this did not constitute new mediation. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> went on to say that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediation rather than being an obstacle
                            to successful negotiations provided the framework within which
                            negotiations ought to take place. Certain things at times had their own
                            mystique and this was the case with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> at the moment; if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            was either sponsoring or guiding mediation this would create a favorable
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Commenting further on the text of a resolution <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> gave the opinion that preference for the
                            Afghan-Iraqi text was not justified because it tries to avoid mediation
                            and so many amendments are needed that it comes very close to the
                            Cypriot one. For example: In their text, the Afghans have put many of
                            the Turkish slogans. They refer to “negotiations” and “mediation”
                            whereas what we must have is negotiation within mediation. They refer to
                            “two communities”, another Turkish slogan. They could refer instead to
                            “the Cypriot people”, without mentioning majority or minority, or they
                            could refer to “all elements of the Cypriot people” without using either
                            the Cypriot or Turkish wording. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> noted that all texts pay lip service to the
                            principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter but if the
                            text states general principles and the principle of continued mediation,
                            then it is the Cypriot text rather than the Afghan one. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> said he had arrived at the
                            above views after close study of all proposed texts.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if any effort was being made by a combined drafting
                            committee to come up with an agreed resolution, to which <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> replied that he did not think
                            so. </p>
                        <pb n="460" xml:id="pg_460" facs="0498"/>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that in the context of this problem each principle of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter carries a great deal of
                            weight. The language of principles becomes complicated, however, and,
                            because of varying interpretations, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has great difficulty in settling issues based on
                            principle. In the long run, the Secretary added, this issue will be
                            solved not by votes but by contacts between the governments concerned.
                            He asked <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> in this regard
                            whether continued mediation would help or hinder bilateral talks. The
                            Deputy Prime Minister asserted that it would facilitate talks and would
                            also make it easier for the Greeks to influence the Cypriots in favor of
                            an agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> told the Secretary
                            that Greece would like to see the U.S. and other western countries adopt
                            a neutral attitude and not fight for one side or the other, especially
                            where two allies are involved. The Secretary remarked facetiously that
                            he was pleased to hear this for he had been waiting twenty years for a
                            foreign minister to say the U.S. should be “non-aligned” in a regional
                            dispute. More seriously, he assured the Deputy Prime Minister that this
                            was a situation where the U.S. could not take sides. He said, however,
                            the word “neutrality” does not apply in this case because it has a

                            Turkish Government and Turkish political and public opinion.</p>
                        <p>1. GA vote marks major diplomatic defeat for Turkey which has been
                            preparing for this test for more than year. In anticipation debate <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0499"/>would occur in 19th GA, Turks
                            dispatched good-will missions to Africa, Arab countries, Eastern Europe,
                            Far East and Latin America as part of concerted <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> policy of broadening its international relationships.
                            Turk officials realistically recognized difficulties of explaining their
                            Cyprus policy in Afro-Asian world and in Latin America, where many
                            countries have minority problems and where resolutions calling for
                            “independence” and “sovereignty” and eschewing “intervention” evoke
                            favorable response. Also recognized local Greek communities would be
                            able to exert influence on policies some governments. However, magnitude
                            of Turkish defeat has come as great surprise, particularly fact <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> failed obtain support of any
                            non-aligned Afro-Asian countries or any LAs and was deserted by all its
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners except US.</p>
                        <p>2. Most serious substantive aspect of GA action for Turks is language in
                            31-nation resolution calling upon nations to desist from intervention in
                            Cyprus, thus undermining <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s
                            fundamental argument its intervention rights are guaranteed by
                            London-Zurich Agreements. While statements of <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> and Caglayangil emphasize that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> does not consider resolution binding,
                            fact remains majority of those voting supported Cypriot view that this
                            aspect of treaties is void. Consequently, GA resolution represents
                            additional restraint on its policies which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> must weigh in considering next steps re Cyprus,
                            particularly if it continues seek improve its relations with Afro-Asian
                            countries. </p>
                        <p>3. US-Turkish bilateral relations have been strengthened by strong US
                            support for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, as demonstrated by warm
                            statements of appreciation by Foreign Minister Caglayangil and Acting
                            Secretary General Binkaya (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 84;

                            civilian and military, voiced gratitude for US support. However,
                            inability of US to influence other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            members, coupled with <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> and TLP
                            attempts to cast suspicion on US motives (reftel) may partially offset
                            current reinforcement of US-Turkish bilateral relations. </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, failure of any other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            country to support Turkey will provide additional ammunition for those
                            who question value of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Alliance. </p>
                        <p>4. Outside government circles, Cyprus vote has provided opposition with
                            exploitable issue and <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName>'s
                            statement is clear signal that <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss>
                            during forthcoming GNA debate will charge <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> government with gross mishandling of Turkey's
                            case in New York. In this effort, <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss>
                            will benefit from its earlier decision not to permit <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> Deputies to become members of Turkey's
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation and can count on
                            support TLP.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> and TLP attacks in GNA will be
                            reinforced by opposition press which is already highlighting dimensions
                            of Turkish defeat while ignoring <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0500"/>fact no Turkish Government could have achieved much greater success.
                            Theme of TLP and anti-American elements in <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> will be that Turkey's defeat attributable primarily to
                            bankruptcy of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s alignment policy.
                            Secondary theme, in which almost all opposition elements can join, will
                            be ineptness with which unsophisticated <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> government handles foreign affairs. Elements in
                            press will also seek to twist US support for Turkey as example of
                            back-stage deal by US, as allegation already advanced by <gloss target="#t_RPP1">RPP</gloss> propagandist Cihat Baban in party organ
                            Ulus (reftel). Efforts of parliamentary opposition to convert adverse GA
                            vote into major domestic political issue may be supplemented by use of
                            student demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>5. Embassy's preliminary conclusion is that while GA vote has been major
                            setback for new <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>
                            government, it can ride out current storm by continuing to reject
                            resolution, by pointing out government's policies essentially same as
                            predecessor government's, including third coalition, and by emphasizing
                            anomalous nature of vote. Foreign Ministry officials are already
                            publicly stressing fact that more than one-half of those voting either
                            voted against resolution or abstained. Privately they making point that
                            majority of pro-Cypriot votes came from African nations with limited
                            influence in world affairs and with no direct responsibility for
                            problems of Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>Major unanswered questions are effect of resolution on ultimate
                            settlement of Cyprus dispute and on future direction Turkish foreign
                            policy. US support for [garble] resolution was based on premise
                            substantive resolution would hinder progress toward ultimate solution to
                            problem. This judgment remains sound although it is too early to
                            determine degree to which GA action will set back prospect of
                            negotiations between parties directly involved. Much will depend upon
                            how <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> decides to exploit
                            limited, tactical advantage achieved at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It is also premature to assess longer-term effect of GA
                            vote on Turkish foreign policy other than to say that GA defeat may
                            cause <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to review some of basic
                            considerations underlying its current policies.</p>

                        <p>1. We believe <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> had two
                            main objectives in mind when he proposed mediation proceed under <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> aegis. Maintenance of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cover for any talks on Cyprus is
                            important for Stephanopoulos govt, just as it was for Papandreou, who
                            had systematically drummed into mind of Greek public that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> path was only traversible course towards
                            just solution of Cyprus problem. Will be recalled that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> last May felt compelled to justify its
                            agreement to begin its dialogue with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            with argument that it was simply following suggestion of Plaza who had
                            recommended talks among parties to dispute.</p>
                        <p>2. Second, <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> probably
                            concluded that one sensible way out of cul-de-sac created by <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName>'s resignation<note n="3" xml:id="d218fn3"> Galo Plaza resigned on December 22, 1965.</note>

                            Mediator's mantle. To find someone else would be difficult and could

                            at least not initially. Rather, Thant could simply state that under

                            was placing himself and Secretariat at disposal of parties concerned for

                                364 from Nicosia, January 21, endorsed these proposals but noted
                                that neither the Cypriot nor Greek Government appeared ready to
                                negotiate .(Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. We agree with Ankara's 819 that general framework for solution should
                            consist of enosis with compensations to Turkey in some form. However, we
                            have serious doubts about anyone getting <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to agree to serve up sufficient compensations
                            here on the island to enable <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to
                            regard solution as double enosis. Unless outside parties ready to impose
                            double enosis concept on Greek Cypriots most we might be able persuade
                            GOC accept would be <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> military
                            presence in one of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> sovereign areas. Of
                            course, [garble—no?] indication now that GOC would consider even this
                            much compensation. In addition to enosis with compensations we believe
                            solution should also include some form of non-federation-federation.

                            parties lead us to believe that neither Greeks nor Turk Cypriots are
                            adamantly opposed to concepts set forth in that <pb n="465" xml:id="pg_465" facs="0503"/>cable. This makes
                            non-federation-federation perhaps best starting point for
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe that one way of getting around enosis problem would be to come
                            up with some formula for postponing decision. This might be along
                            following lines: parties would agree that although other elements of
                            settlement would come into effect immediately question of enosis would
                            be delayed until end of pre-established period, say five years. At that
                            time people of Cyprus voting as whole and not by community would hold
                            plebiscite under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> supervision. They
                            would be asked to consider whether they favored continued independence
                            or enosis with Greece, but it would be agreed in advance that none of
                            rights given Turk Cypriots in other parts of settlement or arrangements
                            preserving these rights would be changed no matter which way vote went.
                            During five year period international financial assistance would be
                            given to both Greek and Turkish Cypriots to leave island if they so
                            chose or to resettle elsewhere on island itself. (Last concept would
                            have to be worked out carefully to avoid it being cloak for partition.)
                            Also during period <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would maintain
                            fairly large observer force which would assist <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commissioner for Human Rights. At end of period and
                            after plebiscite Turk Cypriots only would be asked to vote on whether or
                            not they wished such Commission and Observer Force to continue.</p>
                        <p>3. We realize that this suggestion means continuation of enosis issue for
                            several years but think it might be easier for Turks to accept than
                            immediate enosis even with compensation, thus perhaps lowering price of
                            latter. Furthermore, pro-enosists here becoming discredited and
                            considerably weaker than at various times previously during Cyprus
                            crisis and there is now very little pressure which can be brought to
                            bear on Archbishop to accept enosis with compensations. As long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is around he will
                            determine island's basic attitude towards enosis and Greek Cypriots
                            overwhelmingly accept his tactical approach of obtaining unfettered
                            self-determination first.</p>
                        <p>4. On short range approaches believe that in addition to measures
                            suggested Ankara's 819 we might consider seriously idea para 5 Deptel

                            “mediator” somewhat misplaced in context realities Cyprus situation.
                            [garble] is that mediation implies partial effort by Mediator and our
                            guess is that as <persName corresp="#p_TSS1">Tuomioja</persName> and
                            Galo Plaza before him <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>
                            would end up with same general conclusions as <persName corresp="#p_PLG1">Plaza</persName> report. In light of this we would

                            joint action with Soviets in promoting or guaranteeing solution. We have

                        <p>2. Seems to us that any suggestion of international guarantee for
                            ultimate Cyprus solution is premature. What is needed at this time to

                            for solution, Dept tends to agree that, to obtain <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> acceptance of any formula, it may be
                            necessary to continue prohibition against enosis at least for time. If
                            this proves be case, however, continued exclusion of enosis would be
                            only one element in any package which it might be possible to develop.
                            For example, future status of Turk Cypriots in independent Cyprus would
                            be critical. We feel that finding these elements is first order of

                            acceptable to all parties and give us Turk aims and viewpoints:</p>
                        <p>First: Turkey wants to study what initiatives are possible in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, how to evaluate present situation, what
                            are mediation prospects, how would Greeks and Greek Cypriots act.</p>
                        <p>Secondly: Turkey interested in what are available alternatives in seeking
                            basis for settlement satisfactory to all. Legally, London-Zurich
                            treaties are valid, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> agrees, however,
                            that treaties not eternal but maintains that principles continue exist.
                            Principles on which Turkey must insist re Cyprus are: (A) no unilateral
                            annexation; (B) acknowledgement of existence of two communities; (C) no
                            domination of one community by the other; and (D) both communities must
                            participate in administration.</p>
                        <p>Turkey can negotiate on alternatives (federation, cantonal system) but
                            not on basic principles. In answer to my questions, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he did not wish to go into
                            details of cantonal or other system, all of which can be studied later.
                            Could include “municipal autonomy” or other features. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> continued <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has no complaint against treaties but it is Greeks and
                            Greek Cypriots who want to amend them. Let them make proposals. Turkey
                            is willing to amend treaty provisions if proposed alternative solution
                            at variance with treaty but acceptable to all parties because it is
                            logical and just. Our aim is to find such alternative.</p>
                        <p>I asked <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> if he had adopted
                            independent Cyprus as basis of solution and was no longer considering
                            double enosis formula such as Acheson plan. He replied double enosis
                            does not injure principles outlined above. Any solution including double
                            enosis, federation, cantonal government, a base (by which, I believe, he
                            meant Turk base on Cyprus), might fit in with principles.</p>
                        <p>I said US not committed to any particular solution, nor did it even have
                            a favorite one. We only desired an agreed and permanent one. Asked
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> whether two communities
                            had co-existed without much irritation under Ottoman and British rule.
                            He replied they had never lived together without irritation and
                            conflict, but problems always of local nature until possibility of
                            enosis and independence gave rise to increased conflict. Noted that it
                            useful to discuss Cyprus problem now before situation heats up again,
                            referred to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> interest in own economic
                            development and to Cyprus issue hanging over <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> like Sword of Damocles. Said Turk-Greek bilateral
                            relations must be improved and added, after Turkmen's intervention, that
                            these relations cannot improve outside context of Cyprus problem.
                            Observed that Turkey had raised no claim on Dodecanese, but Greek
                            unilateral annexation of Cyprus would upset Turk-Greek balance
                            established by Treaty of Lausanne, and Turkey would be strategically
                            surrounded.</p>
                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0507"/>
                        <p>Re <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> mediation, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he had no personality in
                            mind. Voiced strong opinion that institution of mediation should be one
                            in which Mediator seeks find middle ground and bring opposing parties
                            together. Said Mediator could not also be arbitrator and judge, like
                            Galo Plaza. I raised as my personal idea possibility of <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> discreetly expanding his
                            activities and functions on Cyprus without benefit of official
                            nomination or publicity. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said
                            only that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> did not want Mediator with
                            preconceived ideas. Turkmen commented that Latin Americans do not have
                            feel for European problems and tend see things in Latin American
                            context. Probably thinking of <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> as well as Galo Plaza, he added that person
                            who had been engrossed in island scene might not see larger Turk-Greek
                            picture. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said this problem
                            would not arise if European were Mediator. Then he warned that enosis by
                            force or apparent independence views of eventual enosis would not be
                            peaceful solution but would lead to guerrilla warfare, sabotage,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> remarked that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Ambassador told him of his return to
                            London for consultation on Cyprus with FonOff and colleagues from Athens
                            and Nicosia. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said he thought
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would then consult with us and
                            hoped that US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> not reach any firm
                            position without consulting Turkey. I replied that any US–UK
                            consultations that might occur would certainly be exploratory. He then
                            asked whether it true that US Ambassadors in Athens and Nicosia had made
                            proposals re Cyprus to respective governments. I said I sure they could
                            not have done so because US has no solution to propose on Cyprus
                            issue.</p>

                            Turk views useful supplement. We believe four-power guarantee of Cyprus
                            independence (and against enosis and partition) would not be feasible or
                            desirable from Turkish point of view. Principal reasons are:</p>
                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> still not inclined to place great
                            trust in USSR. Despite past disappointment in US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and recent efforts toward Turk-USSR
                            normalization of relations, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            continues regard USSR as more friendly to Greece and Cyprus than to
                            Turkey;</p>
                        <p>2. Turkey is committed to position against unilateral enosis but not
                            necessarily against partition or double enosis (Embtel 858);<note n="3" xml:id="d222fn3">
                                <ref target="#d221">Document 221</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Turkey is concerned about its strategic position vis-à-vis Greeks and
                            Greek Cypriots whom Turks tend regard as one enemy, not two. Therefore,
                            in event Cyprus is annexed to Greece, or if Turks lost foothold in
                            Cyprus represented by their 650 men contingent and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> becomes undisputed lord of
                            island, resulting Greek strategic envelopment of Turkey (as Turks prone
                            to see it) constitutes situation which <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> said was unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>4. Nature of guarantee and rights of Turk Cypriot community within
                            independent Cyprus more important in Turk view than guarantee of
                            independence for Cyprus. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and
                            Rolz-Bennett arguments do not seem take account of future role of Turk

                        <p>1. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> communiqué (Embtel 1154)<note n="2" xml:id="d223fn2">Dated February 3. (Ibid.)</note> which climaxed
                            week of discussions shows how far present <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> anxious to avoid cleavage <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0509"/>with Archbishop over any part of current <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> doctrine for Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>2. Theodoropoulos (FonOff) volunteered to us that communiqué was “too
                            long” (by which he likely meant it to be understood that so much detail
                            in communiqué led to spelling out of positions issue by issue which
                            would make future negotiations difficult). He said current tight
                            identity of views between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> was
                            victory for diplomacy of <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> because it had patched up outstanding
                            differences between Athens and Nicosia. In this connection,
                            Theodoropoulos recalled that Archbishop had been cool to current <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and in particular to Stephanopoulos
                            because latter on record in Parliamentary speech in course of which
                            Stephanopoulos suggested “dark forces” had obstructed adoption of
                            Acheson plan. This had led <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to refrain from congratulating Stephanopoulos
                            on his elevation to Prime Minister last September.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> public position on future
                            discussions with Turks has certainly been getting appreciably less
                            flexible in the last month. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> at reception this week honoring <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said, “We agree on basic
                            principle that Cyprus problem is not problem of negotiations and
                            haggling between Greece and Turkey. Cyprus problem is basically and
                            mainly, if not exclusively, despite its impact on Greek-Turkish
                            relations, a problem of self-determination, independence and sovereignty
                            of people of Cyprus. It is up to them to decide their future and their
                            fate.”</p>
                        <p>4. This contrasts with <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName>
                            remarks in Parliament and to the Ambassador (Embtel 1005)<note n="3" xml:id="d223fn3">Dated December 30, 1965. (Ibid.)</note> last
                            December when he indicated a much more flexible view on propriety and
                            utility of Greek-Turkish talks.</p>
                        <p>5. Theodoropoulos reiterated that if Turks want to talk about enosis,
                            Turks and Greeks are competent for such discussions since problem then
                            is addition of territory to Greek soil. But discussions which have to do
                            with the regime on the island as an independent state principally
                            concern Republic of Cyprus and cannot therefore be conducted without
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' participation as
                            principal. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be happy to see

                            but <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will not discuss such questions
                            separately with Turks.</p>

                            conversation two nights ago that he counts good Greek-Turkish relations
                            as extremely important and hopes some agreement could be reached in area
                            of a specific guarantee of independence of Cyprus for ten years. He
                            thought rights of Turk Cypriots could be worked out, preferably on basis
                            that enjoyment their rights be assured by international (presumably
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>) mechanism rather than by
                            Greek-Turkish joint or separate arrangements. He believed agreement
                            along these lines would do <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0510"/>away
                            with any purpose to continued presence of Greek and Turkish contingents
                            on the island. He agreed with me that Turks would consider such an
                            arrangement only on such justification as that Turkey had succeeded in
                            barring enosis for fixed period, at end of which Turks could presumably
                            be in a stronger position to attract world support for justice of Turk
                            views. <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> concluded that
                            he did not believe in official negotiation on these points, but
                            suggested obliquely possibility that “your people in Ankara” (meaning US
                            Emb) could smoke out whether Turks interested in arrangements sketched
                            out above.</p>
                        <p>7. Discussion of defense questions between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            said to have resulted in decision that Greek General Staff would study
                            defense of Cyprus with view to possible reduction of forces. We have no
                            direct confirmation, and <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> (for public consumption) announced yesterday
                            that “under present conditions, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> did
                            not intend to reduce its military forces in Cyprus.”</p>
                        <p>8. Theodoropoulos reports three candidates are under active consideration
                            as new <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> Ambassador to Ankara but
                            “snags” have developed with respect to each candidate. Hopes this
                            personnel placement problem will be ironed out soon.</p>
                        <p>Comment: For domestic political reasons <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> wanted to succeed in making <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> visit occasion for doing away
                            with impression of divergency of views between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. This impulse, we believe, will continue to inhibit
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> in taking initiatives to
                            re-start dialogue with Turks except if specific and stated purpose is
                            solution involving enosis. Greeks keep pointing out that nothing in Turk
                            attitude so far suggests to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that
                            more generalized dialogue likely to have fruitful outcome.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil told Ambassador US
                            and Turkey should work on one or several alternatives. Best alternative
                            should be selected and both countries should then direct efforts to
                            achieve it. He suggested he, FonOff SecGen <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> and Cyprus Bureau Chief Turkmen should
                            participate on Turkish side and Ambassador and one member Embassy staff
                            on US side. He would devote as much time as he could to these meetings
                            although he might not be able to attend every one.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> observed that Cyprus should
                            not be considered separate question outside context of US-Turk
                            relations. Cyprus situation now static but cannot be left thus. Cyprus
                            was sore point for Greece as well as Turkey because all three had other
                            problems, especially economic, to which they could more effectively
                            devote their energies. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            had to consider continuing difficult situation of Turk-Cypriot
                            community. Turkey convinced question must be solved by means of
                            negotiation, and US had important role to play. US should therefore be
                            active now and try to help solve problem before it reached another acute
                            crisis. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> pressed for exchange
                            of views and information with us and for dispassionate (“outside-looking
                            in”) evaluation of Cyprus alternatives. If US-Turk agreement on best
                            alternative reached, US would then, he hoped, use its influence to
                            achieve results.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador replied we could begin exchange of views anytime. He noted big
                            difference in Greek and Turkish positions on approaches to problem of
                            Cyprus. However, it seemed to us that there was still room for maneuver
                            and negotiation between Greek and Turkish positions. Ambassador observed
                            that first Turkish principle was opposition to any unilateral enosis
                            (Embtel 858).<note n="3" xml:id="d224fn3">

                        <p>1. In late 1963 and early 1964 a group of rightist Greek Army colonels
                            (reported at that time as the military conspiratorial group) organized
                            to stage a military coup if Georgios Papandreou accepted support from
                            the United Democratic Left (<gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>). After
                            Papandreou's election, the group was dispersed by transfers to Cyprus
                            and northern Greece. Those officers have now completed their tours in
                            these areas and are gradually returning to key command positions in
                            Athens through the help of Lt. Colonel Georgios Vagenas, Director of the
                            Greek Army General Staff (<gloss target="#t_GAGS1">GAGS</gloss>) office
                            dealing with assignments.</p>
                        <p>2. Although <persName corresp="#p_VLCG1">Vagenas</persName> is not a
                            member of the military conspiratorial group, he is friendly with many of
                            its members and is influenced by Lt. Col. Georgios Papadopoulos, who is
                            now with the First Army in Larissa, and Lt. Col. <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Dimitrios Stamatelopoulos</persName>, both of

                        <p>4. Just before the Center Union (EK) 16 February 1966 rally in Athens,
                            Lt. Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos came to Athens to contact military
                            colonels in the event a coup was deemed necessary to thwart mob violence
                            instigated by <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> or by Georgios
                            Papandreou at the rally. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> told his
                            military contacts that Lt. General Grigorios Spandidakis, Chief of

                        <p>5. The aims of this rightist group are to counter or avert leftist
                            infiltration of the government and the military. Its fears that an
                            uprising similar to that which occurred in the Greek Forces in the
                            Middle East during World War II were increased with the discovery of
                            another military conspiratorial group, Aspida, which the rightist group
                            believes was inspired by the neutralist trend oriented by Center Union
                            (EK) Deputy <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>. As
                            a result of the strenuous efforts by former Chief of KYP, Lt. General
                            (retired) Alexandros Natsinas to have a Reader's Digest article on
                            Brazil, “The Country that Saved Itself”, translated and widely
                            distributed in Greece, the group saw a parallel between the situation in
                            Greece under the Papandreous and the situation created in Brazil by the
                            Joao Belchior Marques Goulart regime. It identifies itself with the
                            thinking and policy of the Brazilian military junta.</p>
                        <p>6. The group has been divided since 1963, when <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName> felt that Papadopoulos
                            was willing to sacrifice competence and integrity for political
                            expediency by his aid to certain officers to obtain key KYP positions
                            and other command positions. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>' actions
                            were in response to political pressures and his desire to placate
                            General Natsinas, then his superior, who was too closely identified with
                            the National Radical Union (ERE). <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName>' faction preferred not to align itself
                            with any political party. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> has used
                            Natsinas and Nikolaos Farmakis, a former <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> deputy noted for his extreme rightist convictions, as
                            contacts to rightist politicians. The key factor now joining the
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName> factions is their common desire to
                            neutralize the power of any officers who have any connections with
                            ASPIDA. Emphasis is now being placed on identifying these officers who
                            continue to occupy secondary posts within the military commands of
                            Athens and who are in a position to learn of the group's activities. The
                            tempo of replacement of these officers is expected to increase during
                            March 1966. As a figurehead, the <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName> group tends to favor Major General
                            (retired) Georgios Ballas.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName>' faction has
                            contact with the Palace through one of the King's aides, Lt. Colonel
                            Dimitrios Zagorianakos. The King's personal secretary Major Michail
                            Armaoutis does not have <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName>' confidence. <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName> feels that if the King
                            opts for extra-constitutional military activity, the King would prefer
                            martial law with rule by decree—a situation which
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and the higher military commanders
                            (particularly Spandidakis, Lt. General Christos Papedatos, and other
                            generals hand-picked by Lt. General (retired) <persName corresp="#p_DLGK1">Konstantinos Dovas</persName>, former Chief of
                            the King's Military Household) would be inclined to accept. <persName corresp="#p_SLCD1">Stamatelopoulos</persName>' faction prefers a
                            military junta which would allow the King very few prerogatives; this
                            faction blames the Palace for the political instability, starting with
                            the fall of former Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis in 1963.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Aside from its effect on Greek politics (reftels) current acute phase
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> feud represents danger to peace
                            and stability on island. We believe there are dangers inherent in
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> “victory”, i.e.,
                            unequivocal control over forces of Greek side on Cyprus especially
                            National Guard.</p>
                        <p>2. From US viewpoint <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>'
                            initial appearance on island in June 1964 had some utility, mainly in
                            organizing and disciplining National Guard and disbanding or absorbing
                            armed bands of <persName corresp="#p_LV1">Lyssarides</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SN1">Sampson</persName>, etc. These purposes
                            were largely accomplished by end of '64 but since that time <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> presence here has had
                            disruptive effect on developments. It is not clear how much collusion or
                            tacit agreement existed between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> at critical moments such as Famagusta last
                            November or Ambelikou earlier but obviously <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> did not exert restraining influence and consensus
                            was that both were <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> doing.
                            On political side his followers constitute most intractable (even though
                            they are anti-Communist) group on island. They are against anything
                            except enosis now and likely continue to be adamantly opposed to any
                            compromise solution.</p>
                        <p>3. Earlier when “instant enosis” was actively being considered as
                            possible solution perhaps <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>
                            had value as man who could be relied upon take effective action on
                            island, theory being that he had necessary prestige with Greek Cypriots
                            and could hold island briefly until <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            assumed administrative control. None of various schemes floated on
                            island at that time envisaged him as ruler of Cyprus for more than few
                            hours or days, it being well understood that except for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' alleged opposition to enosis
                            there existed no real complaints against his government for corruption
                            or mal-administration. Now “instant enosis” followed by immediate
                            appearance of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is unthinkable because
                            of inevitable Turkish reaction. At same time <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> continues to remain at center,
                            in eyes of Cypriots at least, of opposition to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and possibility will always
                            exist that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>, if he had
                            wherewithal in shape of armed forces at his disposal would become
                            exasperated with Greek Cypriots <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0516"/>over trivial or personal reasons and attempt coup d'etat, unilaterally
                            declaring enosis with ominous consequences or even more idiotically
                            attack Turk Cypriots. Furthermore, having given him this facility <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be hard put to disengage from
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>' actions and thus
                            would also bear brunt of Turkish response. (One wonders, under
                            circumstances, what Stephanopoulos could have thought would be end
                            result of ill-advised move in appointing <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> supremo in Cyprus.)</p>
                        <p>4. We are inclined to say that best result of this confrontation now
                            leading to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> showdown would be to neutralize
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> by giving him only
                            nominal authority and aiming at his eventual withdrawal from island
                            under face-saving circumstances. This could be achieved by leaving
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> in command Greek
                            units and appointing someone stature Gennimatas as National Guard

                            dangers to Greece and Cyprus of precipitate action against Turk Cypriots
                            or in respect to enosis. We suggest that if occasion presents itself
                            Embassy Athens if appropriate might express opinions along these lines
                            as soon as possible to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> officials
                            perhaps including Bitsios in Palace.</p>

                            Cyprus. At luncheon which I gave for <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil April 5, Political Counselor summarized
                            impressions of four day trip to Cyprus and subsequent conversations in
                            Athens. This provided opportunity for us to explore Foreign Minister's
                            views on Cyprus situation and Turk attitude toward possible
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>Political Counselor summarized impressions of Cyprus as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Apparent that Turk Cypriot leaders both in Nicosia and other parts of
                            Cyprus were determined to do utmost to protect Turk Cypriot population
                            and defend its rights.</p>
                        <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0517"/>
                        <p>B. Greek Cypriot area of control seemed to be developing normally in
                            economic terms, in contrast to evidence of restrictions and limitation
                            on Turk Cypriot construction, travel, economic development, etc.</p>
                        <p>C. Over long run, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has
                            interest in at least maintaining status quo because he will thereby
                            strengthen his position and contribute to continuing erosion Turk
                            Cypriot position on island.</p>
                        <p>D. Turk Cypriots hold limited cards on Cyprus. They do not have enough
                            bargaining power to offset <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' efforts to whittle away their rights and
                            position.</p>
                        <p>In informal personal discussion in Athens among Embassy representatives
                            from Nicosia, Athens, and Ankara, three possible approaches to Cyprus
                            problem were aired.</p>
                        <p>1. Continuation of existing situation. While this seemed in line with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' wishes and might
                            be acceptable to Greeks, continuation of existing situation could not be
                            regarded as satisfactory by Turk Cypriots or by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. Reconsideration of <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName>
                            plans which might still contain some useful elements which were worthy
                            of negotiation among parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>3. Modus vivendi with provision for deferred settlement, in ten years
                            time, for example. Language would have to finesse ultimate settlement of
                            issues of enosis and partition, and stress would be on protection of
                            Turk Cypriot physical security in intervening period. Variable elements
                            would include future of Greek troops on Cyprus, status of Greek and
                            Turkish contingents, role of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, various types of administrative, judicial and police
                            arrangements for Turk Cypriots, and possibility of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or other international organ to guarantee
                            security Turk Cypriot community.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> replied in several
                            installments as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Prior to becoming <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, he had
                            reached conclusion that because two communities could not live together,
                            only solution was partition or federation. However, seems unlikely such
                            solution could be attained at present time.</p>
                        <p>2. In <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> view, it was also apparent
                            Greek Govt was weak and not in position to make decisive commitment re
                            future of Cyprus. For this reason <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            agreed that modus vivendi, if it could be achieved, followed by interim
                            period leading to final settlement might be possible way of approaching
                            Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>3. Continuation of status quo was out of question since <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had made it clear that this, in itself,
                            was form of fait accompli. Lack of settlement might provoke some Greek
                            Cypriot elements to take action against Turk Cypriots which would compel
                            intervention of Turk armed forces. On other hand, Turk Cypriots,
                            beleaguered and frustrated by status quo, <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0518"/>might themselves instigate incident which would incite
                            Greek Cypriot reaction and thereby trigger Turk intervention.</p>
                        <p>4. Neither Turks nor Turk Cypriots had any faith in <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' interest in security of Turk
                            Cypriots. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would therefore find it
                            impossible to agree to withdraw Turk military contingent prior to final
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> stressed instability in
                            Eastern Mediterranean which would continue to exist, in absence of
                            progress toward settlement, with all that this instability means to
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Suggested that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had important stake in guarantees for
                            Turk Cypriot security and noted sadly that lip service which <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> paid to London-Zurich agreements was
                            of little use to Turk Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>6. Turks considered that basic principles of London-Zurich agreements
                            were still valid and must be incorporated in any new agreements although
                            they were willing to accept modifications and adjustments in LZ to
                            reflect current situation. Any settlement, even of interim nature, must
                            be in accord with honor and dignity of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In reply to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s question re
                            contact with Greek FonOff, POL Counselor mentioned talk with
                            Theodoropoulos April 2. In general terms latter had personally expressed
                            positive interest in approach toward modus vivendi now with provision
                            for deferred settlement.</p>

                        <p>1. Conversation with <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>
                            yesterday indicates continued impasse here with regard his taking any
                            new initiative within context his extended mandate.<note n="2" xml:id="d228fn2">On March 4, Secretary-General Thant informed the
                                Security Council that he was broadening <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>' responsibilities by authorizing him to
                                employ his good offices and to approach the parties in order to
                                achieve discussions at any level. (U.N. Doc. S/7180)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. His most recent conversation with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> showed, if anything, a hardening of Greek
                            Cypriot position with regard any further concessions to Turkish Cypriots
                                <pb n="481" xml:id="pg_481" facs="0519"/>living in enclaves. He said
                            Archbishop had warned him that in making any proposals under extended
                            mandate he should bear in mind that Greek position based on concept of
                            unitary state and any proposals out of line with this concept would be
                            automatically rejected by Greeks.</p>
                        <p>3. In discussing question of any conversations with appropriate
                            representatives Turkish Cypriot community, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has made clear that he not prepared authorize
                            conversations unless Turkish Cypriot side included representatives of
                            dissident Turkish Cypriot elements, i.e. specifically Dr. Ishan Ali.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> commented that this
                            proviso was new and obviously completely unacceptable to Turkish
                            Cypriots. He went on to say, in his view, there was no “will” on part of
                            Greek Cypriots to enter conversations and as matter of fact Archbishop
                            had pointed out that if Turkish Cypriots willing now to sit down to
                            discuss future, in three months time they would be even more willing. In
                            meantime, Archbishop said he prepared wait matter out and reiterated old
                            theme of letting Turks die on vine in their enclaves.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> said his attempts to
                            point out need for some progress prior to June force renewal apparently
                            fell on deaf ears although he continues to believe <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would be worried if force
                            were reduced by more than half. <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName> believes Greek Cypriot leadership being
                            deluded by own propaganda that Turkish Cypriots on verge of collapse. He
                            (and Embassy) have been at some pains to attempt moderate this belief on
                            the part of Greek Cypriots but apparently with little success.</p>
                        <p>5. As further indication that Greeks in no mood make further compromises
                            in “return to normalcy” <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>
                            pointed out that they had substantially changed signals on question of
                            Land Registry Office. <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> had
                            originally told <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to negotiate on basis
                            of books being in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody and on this
                            basis his staff appeared be making progress. A few weeks ago, however,
                            Greeks changed position and now insisting that books come under GOC
                            custody with only supervisory role for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It must have been obvious to Greeks that Turks would never
                            accept on this basis.</p>
                        <p>6. Needless to say <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>
                            discouraged by lack of progress here and while not seeing any great
                            potential good in travel to Athens and Ankara, he is now considering
                            attempting use his influence there late this month or early May.</p>

                            dangers in permitting situation to rest as it is, but sees these dangers
                            outweighed by risk to its own survival in granting any major concessions
                            in return for what whole Greek political spectrum has accepted as only
                            truly viable solution, i.e., enosis. Except for those few who talk of
                            grasping nettle to arrest deteriorating Greek-Turkish relations,
                            tendency of Greeks is to continue trying to keep island quiet and to
                            play for time.</p>
                        <p>2. Implicit Turkish ultimatum would unquestionably anger Greeks. We
                            assume <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would deny GOC is restricting
                            freedom of movement of Turkish-Cypriots and insist Turkish-Cypriot
                            leaders are in fact themselves preventing their brethren from leaving
                            enclaves and returning to their villages. Regarding other “inhuman”
                            restrictions, Greeks would presumably contend that these are properly
                            matters for discussion between two communities under aegis of <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would also point to Turkish “inhuman” actions against
                            Greeks of Istanbul, most of whom have been forced to leave during past
                            two years. Finally, I believe <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would
                            insist (as it regularly and ruefully reminds us) that, however willing
                            it might be to help ease restrictions on Turkish-Cypriots, its influence
                            over <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is definitely
                            limited and it is Archbishop who would have final say.</p>
                        <p>3. If Turks should begin move toward direct actions on island, even in so
                            humanitarian a cause as aide-mémoire adumbrates, Greeks would of course
                            go screaming to United Nations and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            to stop attack on sovereign nation.</p>
                        <p>4. I assume that Turks in their deep frustration over recent developments
                            on Cyprus now see tactical advantage in involving <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in morass of internal problems on
                            island at moment when they have also opened question of U.S. military
                            facilities for discussion. As U.S. has long asserted and as aide-mémoire
                            now underscores, responsible parties <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0521"/>would indeed do well to press on with alleviating
                            conditions of Turk-Cypriots. This would be true even though, as
                            Ambassador Belcher may comment, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            assertions about inhuman restrictions on Turk-Cypriots are not
                            necessarily to be accepted at face value. However, I doubt USG, with its
                            limited leverage on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>,
                            can help situation by getting overly involved in details of Turk-Cypriot
                            conditions. Would not prospective Bernades tour of capitals offer
                            opportunity we can urge Turks to grasp for impressing on parties the
                            seriousness with which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> regards
                            restraints against Turk Cypriots?</p>
                        <p>5. Fundamentally, I see no present course open to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> other than continuing to press for direct talks among
                            parties. With departure of <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d229fn3">

                            less difficult <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, we can hope
                            for more active Greek effort to ease tensions with Turkey (though not,
                            so far as I yet see, at material cost to what Greeks consider to be
                            their interests). In this connection, we here interpret <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> conflict as at least in part reflecting
                            intention of certain elements—e.g. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CKS1">Costopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName>—to retain position on island which could in
                            appropriate circumstances permit Athens to enforce on Nicosia an
                            agreement which might have been reached between <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Though clearly
                            not willing eschew enosis forever and thus blocked so long as Turks
                            publicly insist on prior exclusion of enosis, Greeks may edge toward
                            serious discussions if Turks are really disposed to find a solution.
                            Presumably these talks would include consideration of ways of protecting
                            Turk-Cypriots as part either of final settlement or of interim agreement
                            that would include postponement for some years of decision on Cypriot
                            independence, enosis, or partition.</p>
                        <p>6. Prospects for injecting realism into Greek-Turkish talks would be
                            enhanced if Turks could be persuaded also to talk directly with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> regime and to
                            permit direct talks between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Turkish-Cypriots. Recognizing how
                            vigorously <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has resisted opening
                            those channels, I nevertheless believe we should push this idea.</p>
                        <p>7. If Greek political scene quiets down somewhat after current confidence
                            debate, we here will do all in our power to rub Greek noses in realities
                            of Turkish frustrations. At same time, I hope <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> can make clear to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            that threat of force applied unilaterally to provision Turkish-Cypriots
                            would bring us all to a dire state.</p>

                            have an opportunity to talk about problems of mutual interest and
                            particularly wanted to discuss Cyprus and the aide-mémoire which the

                            subject to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. The same aid-mémoire
                            had also been sent to HMG but to no one else.<note n="2" xml:id="d230fn2">The Embassy in Ankara commented on the Turkish

                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> replied that he
                            wanted to stress that his remarks on the aide-mémoire would be strictly
                            preliminary and that there would be an official reply after he had had
                            an opportunity to discuss it with the President. The Secretary assured
                            Caglayangil that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> shared his
                            concern about the situation of the Turkish Cypriots. He hoped that the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would make a full démarche on
                            the subject to the UNSYG.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister then alluded to the recent appointment of a Greek
                            Cypriot as Minister of Agriculture on the island as another example of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> technique. He
                            stressed that the difficulty in talking with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> or in presenting the Turk
                            demand for “normalization of conditions” for the Turk Cypriots
                            (contained in the aide-mémoire) to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            would be that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would say
                            let them go back to their villages. This, of course, would not be
                            normalization because the Turk Cypriots would remain under pressure;
                            what the Turks have in mind is equalization of living conditions for the
                            Turk Cypriots within their present enclaves.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that he understood the point, but asked if that
                            were an obstacle in going to the UNSYG. <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName>, <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> of the
                            Turkish <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0523"/>Foreign Ministry,
                            interjected “no—we can make a démarche and wait awhile.” The Secretary
                            then asked the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> position on Turkish
                            participation in the Cypriot Government. For example, at one time the
                            UNSYG had offered some guarantees in connection with Turk participation
                            in the government.</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil then replied that Turk participation in the Cypriot
                            Government was a good step toward normalization and would be a part of a
                            modus vivendi which the Turks could accept. However, the prospects for
                            such participation looked dim. The aide-mémoire was addressed to the
                            idea that the Turks must have the same conditions in their sectors as
                            the Greeks have in theirs. If the two communities were living under the
                            same conditions then time would cease to be a factor working in favor of
                            the Greek Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> accepted
                            the central idea of normalization. Furthermore, the Foreign Minister was
                            correct in saying that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            would reply, “if the Turks want normalization, let them go back to their
                            villages.” <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would not
                            want any steps taken that would represent de facto partition.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he had two very important points that he
                            wished to emphasize: (1) the Greek Government was weak, which offers
                            easy opportunity for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to
                            engage in provocations; (2) the Turk community was weakening;
                            particularly its morale was weak. It also might engage in provocations.
                            The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and “even a reasonable Greek Government” were concerned
                            with other important problems and would want to avoid provocations.
                            However, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, the Greek
                            Cypriots and the Turk community would not be bound by the same sense of
                            responsibility.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he believed that the governments involved did not
                            want to inflame the situation; therefore, it behooved all to be patient
                            and diligent in seeking solutions to the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister replied that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            was the last one to whom patience needed to be recommended. He felt the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> record was clear and that it had
                            been extremely patient. He emphasized that the aide-mémoire did not
                            represent a new <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> decision nor was it
                            in preparation for a move (the implication was a military move).
                            However, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wished to raise some of
                            the difficult questions involved. These were also questions that in some
                            manner had to be answered for Turkish public opinion. For instance, what
                            should Turkey do in case of new massacres? In case of an attack on the
                            Turkish contingent? In case of the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces which could lead to the events
                            suggested in the first two questions? For how long can the Turkish
                            community be left in its exposed position?</p>
                        <p>Without waiting for a reply, he continued that he wanted to reemphasize a
                            point that he had already made to the Secretary. “Why is the <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0524"/>U.S. in the Cyprus problem at all? It
                            is not a signatory power to the treaty of guarantee. However, Cyprus has
                            in fact become a very important factor in Turkish-American relations.
                            There was an outbreak of violence on the island in 1963. Turkey could
                            have intervened. At a time when there were no opposing forces on the
                            island and an intervention could have been successful, relatively
                            bloodless, and could have prevented the terrible things that
                            subsequently happened to the Turkish community, why did we not
                            intervene? The answer is that the U.S. did not want us to do so. For
                            example, the <persName>Johnson</persName> letter was an obstacle and we
                            are still under an obligation to reply to public opinion in Turkey to
                            the question why we did not use this right of intervention guaranteed by
                            the treaty.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the problem to the U.S. had not been a
                            question of treaty rights but a question of a war between Greece and
                            Turkey. The U.S. position had been that the serious consequences of such
                            an event to the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> alliance must be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that he had given the same answer to the
                            Turkish Parliament. However, this did not change the situation that the
                            treaties had been violated. Furthermore, in any appeal to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> the answer was a foregone conclusion,
                            do nothing. Under the treaties a solution to this type of problem was
                            already provided. Greece and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> were
                            committed as was Turkey to intervene to prevent violence. The real
                            solution should have been tripartite action to protect the communities
                            and to enforce the treaties. This had not happened because neither the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> nor Greece was willing to live up
                            to treaty obligations. He also wanted to clarify that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> did not hold treaties to be permanent
                            and that Turkey was prepared to negotiate changes as needed. He ended by
                            emphasizing again the great pressure of public opinion on the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> as regards a satisfactory solution to
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wanted to thank the Foreign Minister for
                            understanding that the U.S. did not invent the Cyprus problem. He hoped
                            that it was also understood that it was because of our friendship with
                            Turkey that we had become involved. However, he wanted to say frankly
                            that Turkey must not allow this problem to become the central issue of
                            our bilateral relations. Around the world there were 25 such problems
                            e.g., India-Pakistan, Indonesia-Malaysia, etc. If in each case these
                            specific problems were to be made the central issue of our own bilateral
                            relations with the countries involved, we would be given a burden we
                            could not carry. “You would make us your satellite and we cannot be a
                            satellite. This is the kind of situation that would drive us into
                            isolation.”</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister thanked the Secretary for his frankness. He said
                            that the present Turkish Government did not start to make Cyprus the
                            central issue. He did not want to discuss internal Turkish politics, but
                            when this government came to power, Cyprus had been made the central <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0525"/>issue between the U.S. and
                            Turkey by the previous government. At any rate, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> was now saying that if present
                            conditions on the island continue, it must take initiative. It has
                            prepared an aide-mémoire with a specific list of conditions to which the
                            Turks object. The <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wants the U.S. to
                            come forward and say yes, the Turks are right. Human rights, etc., are
                            being violated. This sort of stance would help the problem of
                            Turkish-American relationships.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary answered that he had personally spent much time with the
                            Greeks, Greek Cypriots and other parties on the problem of the Turkish
                            Cypriots. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> had
                            also. A moment ago the Foreign Minister had raised a series of difficult
                            questions. The Secretary wanted to emphasize that what we all wanted was
                            to prevent the situations that gave rise to those questions. In other
                            words, the questions were so difficult to answer that one must prevent
                            the questions from having to be asked.</p>
                        <p>At this point Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> entered the conversation, saying, “We accept the
                            fact that you have very difficult worldwide problems but we are saying
                            that here in this country, Cyprus is the hot issue from which none of us
                            can escape. The events on the island have been inhuman, cruel, and
                            against human rights. Why is the U.S. connected with Cyprus? It was not
                            a party to the Cyprus agreements. Those agreements contained a procedure
                            for solving the kind of dispute that arose in December 1963. That
                            procedure was three party intervention. This did not occur for the
                            reasons we discussed. Now the agreements have been violated several
                            times. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has said there
                            are no agreements. The <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has said ‘no’
                            to the use of the guarantees contained in the treaties. We understand
                            that the U.S. position was based on its concern that there be no war
                            between Greece and Turkey. We are an independent country. Perhaps we
                            should have gone ahead anyhow. However, that's all behind us. As it
                            appears to Turkish public opinion, you do not want us to use the
                            agreements. But why did you react so strongly to the prospect of our
                            intervention and then do nothing when the Greeks sent 15,000 troops to
                            the island? Cyprus is almost under Greek occupation. Why was there no
                            reaction to this? Perhaps there is no need to discuss this point but you
                            must understand that it is a factor. It is for this reason in the eyes
                            of Turkish public opinion you have responsibilities. Now our Foreign
                            Minister is saying that the issue may flare up again. This is no threat.
                            There are responsible governments in Turkey. However, if something
                            happens again—public opinion will demand action. If anything happens, it
                            will be difficult to keep peace although we want to keep the peace and
                            it is clearly to the advantage of the Turks that there be peace in this
                            part of the world. If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force
                            withdraws leaving 10,000 Greek troops on Cyprus, what happens if
                            shooting starts? We want you to influence <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0526"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and the Greek
                            Government to see that nothing happens. We cannot always be the ones to
                            give.”</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he wanted to make another point— because of
                            Cyprus the Turkish army was constantly on the alert and had been
                            distracted from its <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> mission.
                            Another point to be remembered was that in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Council the Greek Foreign Minister had said
                            categorically there were no Greek forces on Cyprus. Now, however,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and the Greek Government were
                            engaged in a public dispute about the function of the force, its
                            command, etc., and there was no further pretense it did not exist.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH1">Bayulken</persName> interjected to say that
                            the Greeks had used the excuse that Turkey was on the point of invasion,
                            which was not true. He also wished to emphasize, returning to the
                            aide-mémoire, that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> must have a
                            pipeline to the Turk Cypriot force supply. This was part of
                            normalization. Furthermore, if something should flare up on the island,
                            then what? Would there be another letter from the US? If the Turks
                            should react, and if there were a threat from the outside, would Turkey
                            get <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> help?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was important to discuss this kind of
                            situation within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He then asked
                            for Turkish views on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force. The
                            Foreign Minister replied that it must continue and that an improvement
                            in the manner in which it carried out its function was an important
                            factor for the improvement of the condition of the Turks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s view of the
                            Russian position. For instance, he had heard rumors that the Russians
                            had told <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that they
                            would send no more arms. The Foreign Minister replied that the Russians
                            accepted the principle of two separate communities on the island and
                            accepted the idea of a federal constitution. Their other condition,
                            however, was no outside intervention. In his opinion, if the Turks and
                            their allies were able to come up with a solution, there would be no
                            Russian interference.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> then commented that
                            there was at present a very weak Greek Government and asked if the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> entertained any hope that a
                            future <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would be strong enough to
                            make an agreement on Cyprus. Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> replied that he expected no stronger Greek
                            Government at any time in the future. If the Greeks were to go to
                            elections, Cyprus would be an issue. Subsequently, a Greek Government
                            would have even less flexibility. He wished to emphasize that his party,
                            although it could have, had not used Cyprus as an issue in the October
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that it had been a valuable chance to discuss the
                            aide-mémoire. In Washington he would be discussing it again with the
                            President following which there would be an answer.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> said he wanted to
                            emphasize his belief in Turkish-American friendship and his regret that
                            the Cyprus issue had become a trap for <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0527"/>this friendship. It was clear that Turkish public
                            opinion felt that if Cyprus could not be solved by the guarantor powers,
                            it should be solved within the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            alliance.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary ended the Cyprus discussion by promising, “We will do our
                            best.”</p>

                        <p>1. I invited <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> to lunch at
                            residence May 4 to meet AsstSec <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. Regarding Cyprus, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> sincerely desired to resume
                            friendly relations with Turkey and to find solution to Cyprus question.
                            He said that in his meeting with Turkish Amb Tuluy he had emphasized
                            this point, and in addition assured <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            that (1) <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would not accept coup
                            d'etat by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on island and
                            (2) <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> renounced use of force as means
                            of settling dispute. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> added
                            that he hoped <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would also declare
                            itself along same lines.</p>
                        <p>3. Initial question, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> continued,
                            was how to begin talks. One major problem was <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>: if talks were held in secret
                            and he learned of them—which he probably would—then he would denounce
                            them as “betrayal” of Cyprus cause; whereas if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> were informed in advance of
                            them, he would undoubtedly “torpedo” them. King, he said, had suggested
                            that talks be undertaken without knowledge of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, but <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> commented that he doubted that
                            this would be possible, particularly in view of many connections
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has here. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> observed that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could count on support of
                            opposition (Papandreou) and Communists in Greece, as well as certain
                            elements of right-wing press whom he has “bought.” <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then posed question, asking what
                            we thought would be best approach. AsstSec <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> replied that he agreed it would be extremely
                            difficult to keep such talks secret.</p>
                        <p>4. Another problem, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>
                            continued, was “level” on which talks should be held i.e., whether at
                            Ambassadorial, Ministerial, <pb n="490" xml:id="pg_490" facs="0528"/>or
                            even “higher” level. Should talks be held at higher level and not
                            succeed, it could be disastrous. AsstSec <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> asked if <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            had confidence that both <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> Amb
                            Delivanis in Ankara and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> Amb Tuluy in
                            Athens had “necessary contacts” to carry out this task. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> replied that as far as Delivanis
                            is concerned, he has complete confidence that Amb shares fully views of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> on Cyprus problem: as to his
                            abilities, only time would tell. Tuluy seems genuinely to want to find
                            solution to Cyprus crisis, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> said.</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then talked of possible
                            final solution. Enosis, he pointed out, would be best for all concerned,
                            since an independent <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            could be dangerous element in area, due to his connections with the
                            non-aligned nations. However, if <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            insisted, perhaps question could be put off for “three to five years,”
                            at end of which time plebiscite could be held to determine will of
                            Cypriot people. Possible solution, he continued, would be changing of
                            one of British bases into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base, in
                            which <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could participate: <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could even represent this base as their
                            own to Turkish public. British, he continued, have indicated they would
                            be willing to discuss giving up one of their bases if by such means
                            solution could be found to Cyprus problem.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> then asked for U.S. views on
                            problem. AsstSec <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> said he had
                            found during his recent visit to Ankara<note n="2" xml:id="d231fn2">As
                                part of the U.S. Delegation to the <gloss target="#t_CENTO1">CENTO</gloss> Ministerial Council Meeting April 19–22.</note>
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is most anxious to settle
                            Cypriot problem as quickly as possible so that it can face up to
                            economic problems confronting country. However, opposition would not let
                            govt alone on Cyprus question, thus forcing it to devote considerable
                            time and effort to this problem. However, AsstSec <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> said his visits to both Athens and
                            Ankara had indicated there was sincere desire on both sides to find
                            early solution to Cyprus question. Perhaps for first time, AsstSec
                                <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName> said, psychological
                            climate in both countries is similar, and this should facilitate moving
                            ahead on problem. When <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> complained about Turkish “threats” to
                            invade Cyprus, which he said made his own position more difficult with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and Greek
                            opposition, Sec noted that <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>
                            also had problem with his own opposition, and that “threats” should be
                            seen in this light.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> As in our previous talk (Embtel
                                1589)<note n="3" xml:id="d231fn3">Telegram 1589, April 26, reported

                                of the prospects for his government and his views on the Cyprus

                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> impressed me with his sincere
                            desire to restore good relations with Turks and get discussions
                            underway, although Greeks still preoccupied with mechanics of initiating
                            talks. Further, there appears to be growing inclination to accept idea
                            of putting issue “on ice” for period of up to five years, although in
                            Greek view such a delay in settlement would need to <pb n="491" xml:id="pg_491" facs="0529"/>be coupled with some provision that at
                            end of period would enable Cypriots to opt for enosis. Despite his good
                            intentions, however, it is apparent that <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> is hesitant to move forcefully lest he give
                            opposition and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>

                            not believe <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>' visit has
                            had much effect on Turks. They have been conscious of his limited
                            ability to improve conditions of Turk Cypriots and have never expressed
                            much enthusiasm about his expanded instructions. They are also aware of
                            negative US position on <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s four-power
                            guarantee proposal.<note n="3" xml:id="d232fn3">See <ref target="#d220fn2">footnote 2, Document 220</ref>.</note>
                            Furthermore, while pressing forward toward bilateral talks with Greece,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> apparently does not foresee much
                            hope in outcome of such talks unless some means is devised to move
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>We believe <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> recognizes that attitude
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is key to any Cyprus
                            solution. We also believe that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> sees
                            need to use all available means to apply pressure on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Accordingly, this would call
                            for rather far-flung <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> approach to
                            problem which is foreshadowed in Turk aide-mémoire.</p>
                        <p>Following would seem to be included in this policy:</p>
                        <p>A. Bilateral talks with Greece on final solution. If it agreed that final
                            solution currently impractical, negotiations would turn to modus
                            vivendi. Since Turks believe realistically that even modus vivendi, or
                            interim arrangement, would require elaborate, lengthy negotiation
                            process, they have focused on more immediate question of welfare and
                            security of <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0530"/>Turk Cypriots. They
                            have furthermore weighed in with aide-mémoire for maximum effect.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will not exclude any reasonable
                            proposal coming from any direction. This means it will not automatically
                            reject <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>' proposal, or
                            more specifically <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s four-power UNSC
                            guarantee, or mediation, or role by <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> powers, etc.</p>
                        <p>C. Aide-mémoire clearly sets forth Turk position to US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. It refers to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s “new assessment of the problem” and offers to consult
                            with respective governments. It therefore invites the two governments to
                            take active role in situation. If they should refuse, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could always assert it had consulted US
                            and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>D. Use of somewhat threatening tone in aide-mémoire is not only
                            attributable to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> frustration and its
                            increasingly weakening position on Cyprus. It seems also designed to
                            spark activity in other quarters (like US) to bring pressure to bear on
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and GOC to adopt reasonable and
                            forthcoming posture.</p>
                        <p>E. Recent military and naval exercises by Turk armed forces seem designed
                            to enhance credibility of eventual Turk unilateral action. They may feel
                            need to stress to outside world that second Presidential letter to
                            Turkish <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss><note n="4" xml:id="d232fn4">Not found.</note> will not sidetrack <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> plans.</p>
                        <p>F. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> also wishes to expose insincerity
                            of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in his stress of
                            independent Cyprus at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> while pursuing
                            pro-enosis line at least in communiqué signed in Athens and in
                            “permission” to Athens to discuss enosis with Turkey in his absence.</p>
                        <p>G. Deadline for bringing political discussion to some kind of conclusion

                            but instead depends on developments. It is unlikely, however, that
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would allow situation to drag on
                            into late fall or winter without action on its part unless it were
                            persuaded that signs of progress and diplomatic activity justified
                            delaying deadline.</p>
                        <p>H. As completely last resort, we are convinced <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is prepared to undertake unilateral action to assist
                            welfare and security of Turk Cypriots. In first instance, such action
                            might well be non-military but would be supported by military units if
                            any interference occurred.</p>
                        <p>While taking foregoing into account, we should also bear in mind that US
                            reply to aide-mémoire along bland lines of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> reply would be negatively received by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Instead we would recommend US reply
                            along following lines:</p>

                            our willingness to discuss the means whereby these needs could be

                            of apparent <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> willingness to negotiate
                            outstanding issues. We would hope to keep in close touch with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> on status of these talks.</p>
                        <p>3. We should include in our reply specific statement that we are willing

                            Turkey and Greece. We should add that timing of any such assistance
                            would naturally depend on the attitude of negotiating parties and on our
                            view whether we could usefully contribute to settlement.</p>
                        <p>4. We would consider desirable for the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to consider possibility of agreeing to reciprocal
                            freedom of movement for Turk Cypriot and Greek Cypriot civilians to and
                            from each other's areas of control.</p>
                        <p>5. We would have to state frankly that we believe military action by
                            Turkey in regard to Cyprus would be unprofitable for Turkey and unlikely
                            to improve the prospects for satisfactory settlement.</p>
                        <p>We strongly support continuation of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> as long as situation requires it and provided other
                            nations assist in its maintenance. We would, however, point out that
                            climate for continuation of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>
                            at an adequate level may rapidly worsen in the absence of evidence of

                            willing to show flexibility on question of reciprocal freedom of

                        <p>In addition to other considerations, we believe we must call attention to
                            fact that in Turkey we are dealing with moderate [illegible] party
                            government essentially friendly to us. Not only immediate question
                            relating to bilateral defense agreements but also shape of future
                            relations with this government and with Turks may be affected by tone
                            and nature of our reply. Equally important to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will be US attitude toward lending helping hand in
                            negotiations with Greeks or in latter stage when <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> must inevitably enter
                            picture. Essentially US position should be friendly and forthcoming as
                            possible and should avoid placing <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0532"/>unrealistic hopes on GOT–GOG bilaterals or give

                            Cyprus problem in keeping with Turk national interests.</p>
                        <p>Re timing of US reply to aide-mémoire, we inclined to believe it could be
                            delivered to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> upon his return
                            to Ankara from present travels (Brussels May 14, RCD meeting in Tehran

                            Turk Cyps and perpetuating Turkish enclaves, or failing that, (2 clear
                            way for Turkish ultimatum backed by real threat of limited military
                            action. This presents us with dilemma in replying, since either
                            forthcoming or cool response would lead us in undesirable direction.</p>
                        <p>2. Turkish move appears to have been based on assumption even interim
                            political settlement unlikely in near future. We somewhat more
                            optimistic regarding possibility interim “modus vivendi” arising from
                                <pb n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0533"/>planned Greek-Turkish
                            talks, with possible assist from <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.
                            We, therefore, believe it logical and beneficial put off dilemma posed
                            by Aide-mémoire by postponing (rather than intensifying or refusing)
                            discussion with Turks on ways improve welfare Turk community and
                            continuance <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>. This approach
                            implies we must take hard look our position, if Greek-Turkish talks
                            fail.</p>
                        <p>3. Except for general wording on avoiding actions that would disturb
                            talks, we agree Nicosia's 547 that response should not include direct
                            reference to unfortunate consequences Turkish military action.</p>
                        <p>4. With above in mind we propose respond to Turks with following
                            Aide-mémoire:</p>
                        <p>5. “The United States Government greatly appreciates the Turkish
                            Government's past willingness to consult on problems involving Cyprus
                            and is gratified to be given the opportunity to comment on the Turkish
                            Government's current thinking regarding this subject as set forth in its
                            Aide-mémoire of April 19. As the Turkish Government is aware, the United
                            States Government has followed the Cyprus problem closely since December
                            1963, and shares the Turkish Government's profound concern that this
                            issue continues to be a source of friction in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>6. “The United States Government is aware that even though the conditions
                            existing during the first year after the outbreak of the present crisis
                            appear to have been ameliorated somewhat, the Turkish Cypriots still
                            live under circumstances which are abnormal and regrettable. The United
                            States Government sympathizes with those who have suffered hardships as
                            a result of the unsettled conditions on the island and has done what it
                            could to improve the welfare of the Turkish Cypriots by donating relief
                            supplies to the Turkish community and by offering other assistance. The
                            United States Government shall continue to seek ways in which it can be
                            of further help, pending a settlement of the fundamental political
                            problem that will permit a stable, secure life for the people of
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>7. “The United States Government is closely following and encouraging the
                            efforts of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary-General's
                            personal representative, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BC1">Bernardes</persName>, to bring about improved conditions on the
                            island. The United States Government welcomed the decision of the United
                            Nations Secretary-General to enlarge the terms of reference of his
                            Special Representative, and hopes that this broadened mandate will open
                            opportunities for such improvement.</p>
                        <p>8. “The United States Government notes the importance which the
                            Government of Turkey has attached to the role of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in Cyprus and its relationship to the
                            security and welfare of the Turkish community on the island. The United
                            States has consistently supported the peacekeeping efforts of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> since that force was
                            established in March 1964. It <pb n="496" xml:id="pg_496" facs="0534"/>notes with satisfaction that the Turkish Government also recognizes
                            the role which <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> has played in
                            the maintenance of peace and order. The United States Government shares
                            the Turkish Government's belief that a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            presence must be maintained on the island and to this end the United
                            States is prepared to cooperate in supporting the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> peacekeeping effort in Cyprus. However, as the
                            Aide-mémoire of the Turkish Government properly notes, many countries
                            have become reluctant to continue their contributions to <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> in the absence of significant
                            progress on the underlying political issues.</p>
                        <p>9. “Since receipt of the Aide-mémoire of April 19, 1966, the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been advised of the intention of
                            the Turkish and Greek Governments to resume talks on this subject. In
                            the opinion of the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> this must be
                            considered a most encouraging development which will permit
                            consideration of the means of achieving a settlement leading to
                            stability in Cyprus. The United States Government would like to keep in
                            close touch with the Turkish Government on the status of these
                            discussions.</p>
                        <p>10. “While these talks are in progress, it would clearly be desirable to
                            avoid statements or actions that might in any way impair the still
                            tenuous links of communication among the parties involved. However, if
                            the forthcoming discussions should fail to have the hoped-for result,
                            the United States Government would wish to discuss further with the
                            Turkish Government the matters raised in the Turkish Government's

                            until Saturday to discuss but his first reaction was this was
                            non-starter. He parrotted Archbishop's remarks of some months ago that

                            by making life simpler and more comfortable for Turkish Cypriots in

                        <p>2. With regard new tougher policy vis-à-vis Turkish Cypriots he was
                            adamant in assessment that govt must take some action against Turkish

                            Knodhara area was consolidation of new enclave and GOC would not permit

                            did not accept my arguments that increased pressure on community in

                        <p>1. At Luncheon today <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> briefed me
                            on process [<hi rend="italic">progress</hi>?] of Greek-Turkish dialogue
                            to date.</p>
                        <p>2. His impression is that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> (meaning
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>, Caglayangil and some
                            around them) are serious about reaching accommodation with Greece in
                            order concentrate on economic questions but that “forces” beyond their
                            control frustrate attempts to proceed. He characterized atmosphere as
                            one of serious intent but where both parties are fearful of next step in
                            belief increasing number pressures desiring sabotage discussions will
                            win out and that interrupted discussions will mean serious setback for
                            both Athens and Ankara. He identified as forces in Turkey limiting
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> maneuver press and the military.
                            He cited sequence of recent events on Imvros and Tenedos as basis Greek
                            assessment split in Turkish intentions re dialogue.</p>
                        <p>3. He said <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> representatives visiting
                            Imvros lately have told Greeks there that Turkish Government would like
                            to straighten out situation, but cannot in view fact Turkish National
                            Security Council has decided militarize Imvros and expropriate property.
                            Turkish press now playing up Greek “colonizing intentions” re islands
                            and citing Greek concern as example Greek imperialism (megali idhea).
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> reports Toumbas
                            now of opinion that he does not see how <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> domestically can withstand any more press play re
                            “persecutions” on Imvros and suggested time had come to refuse extension
                            residence permits of Turk nationals (particulary on Rhodes) who come
                            under expired 1930 Treaty of Establishment, even though he, Toumbas,
                            believes dialogue is important and would like to see it continue.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> of course
                            lamented fact Turkish tactics (particularly extremist anti-dialogue
                            forces) are only playing into <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' hand. He repeatedly professed sincere
                            determination withdraw Greek forces from Cyprus if some arrangement
                            could be reached for demilitarization and some form Turkish assurance
                            and suspension military action. He said fact Greek forces on island are
                            hostages in hands of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is
                            source deepest concern to responsible members his government. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> indicates lack of concern
                            should his actions lead to Greek-Turkish military confrontation on
                            island. According <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0537"/>Archbishop thinks he can undermine
                            current Greek Government by lending support to <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> leader <persName corresp="#p_CKP1">Canellopoulos</persName> who, because of his complex regarding
                                <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName> and his
                            desire to strengthen his own position as head of party, wants early
                            elections. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is making
                            funds available to new Athenian daily Eleftheros Cosmos which is
                            scheduled to begin publishing next week and which is expected to support
                            views of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on Cyprus and
                            of <persName corresp="#p_CKP1">Canellopoulos</persName> on domestic
                            issues. (However, <persName corresp="#p_CKP1">Canellopoulos</persName>
                            can bring down government at any moment on domestic issues before recess
                            committee, without depending on Cyprus question.)</p>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> says next stage dialogue is
                            Turkish expression their views on Greek suggestions for definitive
                            solution involving demilitarization of Cyprus, conversion of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> base into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or multipartite base with Greek and Turkish
                            participation, plus liberal minority rights for Turkish-Cypriots.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> suggested now
                            would be appropriate time for American intervention to convince Turks to
                            consider carefully how <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> can help keep
                            dialogue alive.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> also mentioned possibility
                            of provisional arrangement including demilitarization, conversion of
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> base into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> or multipartite base with Turk and Greek
                            participation, minority rights, plus plebiscite after five years. If
                            Turks would agree to plebiscite, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said, he thought <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            could persuade or somehow get <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to return exclusively to his ecclesiastical
                            functions. Key feature of this scheme would be <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s giving up right of intervention in Cyprus under
                            Article 4. In any case, <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> added,
                            some Greek-Turkish agreement is essential before <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> can act to control <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I do not believe we have yet reached
                            point where it would be advisable for U.S. to weigh in with either side
                            regarding substance of dialogue, particularly since according <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>
                            <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has not responded to Greek ideas for
                            definitive solution. I am very much concerned, however, that elements

                            talks. Measures against Greeks on Tenedos and Imvros are receiving
                            increasing attention in Greek press and helping elements here who do not
                            wish talks to succeed. I would much welcome Embassy Ankara's comments on

                            Turkey, particularly with reference to <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> government's relation to Turkish military and

                        <p>713. At my request, I called on George Papandreou on August 5 for his
                            views on current political situation. He was obviously braced to make
                            more specific comments than on some earlier occasions.</p>
                        <p>1. Papandreou described Greece today as at critical stage. He said there
                            are two roads it can follow. Present course would lead to
                            catastrophe—other to normality. Queen <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Frederika</persName>, former <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> and former DefMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> are urging King on
                            first course. Queen <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Frederika</persName> is
                            exploiting King's sense of honor (filotima) to hold him to present
                            catastrophic course. Present course if pursued will bring dictatorship
                            and revolution, which would be Communist-led but supported by many
                            non-Communists, as occurred during <gloss target="#t_EAM1">EAM</gloss>
                            period and guerrilla war of 1946–49.</p>
                        <p>2. Papandreou said both he and King had taken opposing positions in past
                            and both should now forget past and look to future. Neither can renounce
                            all past stands. In his July 23 speech, he had spoken sternly about
                            past, but in conciliatory tone about future. King could break current
                            impasse by making gesture of reconciliation with people in form of
                            declaration calling for elections and confirming his desire to see
                            smooth operation of democratic government in Greece, free and honest
                            elections, and constitution observed. He, Papandreou, would support
                            this.</p>
                        <p>3. Papandreou said basic issue for Constantine was and is control of
                            army. Army should be national, not belong to any party. Former DefMin
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName> had made a mistake
                            by identifying himself with the Palace because he wanted to become
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>. Papandreou could assure
                            King that, if there were elections and he came to power, he would
                            appoint as DefMin someone in whom both had confidence. Neither he nor
                            Constantine wants to see organizations in army of <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">IDEA</gloss> and Aspida type. However, King wants
                            an army loyal to him personally.</p>
                        <p>4. Papandreou commented that people speak of splinters in the Center
                            Party. This is not true. He alone controls party. Center policy is his
                            policy. But if he should “leave,” he cannot guarantee that this will be
                            the case.</p>
                        <p>5. Papandreou then made his main pitch. What is needed at present
                            critical moment is help by Americans. US could use influence to help
                            King see need for abandoning road leading to dictatorship. Action on
                            American side would not be considered intervention. Dictatorship could
                                <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0539"/>cause chaotic situation
                            which could have serious repercussions outside Greece (unrest in
                            Balkans; free hand to Turkey to intervene in Cyprus). Successful
                            functioning of democracies is in US interest all over world. It is
                            logical for US to speak on this point to save Greece from civil war.</p>
                        <p>6. In response to my question, Papandreou said he has had no contact with
                            Palace. Someone needs to convey his views to the King, someone outside
                            invidious Psychiko circle (meaning Queen Mother and her confidantes). If
                            he (Papandreou) attempted to convey this kind of feeling, it would be
                            interpreted as compromising his position, and both sides would suffer.
                            Gesture to be effective must be spontaneous initiative on part of King.
                            It must not appear that there are secret agreements. Papandreou added he
                            had not heretofore intimated these thoughts to anyone, not even to his
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>7. I remarked that some feel rapprochement between himself and King is
                            being impeded by public statements of younger CU elements. Papandreou
                            acknowledged there are some “eager for applause who have found that
                            anti-monarchist statements bring this applause. Today they say these
                            things for demagogic reasons; if allowed to continue, they only become
                            persuaded.” Longer present course continues bitterer are public
                            emotions, even though demonstrations may become fewer.</p>
                        <p>8. I asked whether he expects monarchy to be electoral issue. Papandreou
                            replied that election declaration by King could bury the issue. Campaign
                            would then be fought mainly “between parties” of which there are really
                            only two: <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> and Center. Except for
                                <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>, foreign policy would not be an
                            issue. Papandreou added that his own position is well known, i.e. Greece
                            belongs to Western Alliance but should cultivate economic and cultural
                            relations with East.</p>
                        <p>9. Papandreou denied that <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> has
                            succeeded in confusing issue whether popular front exists between CU and
                                <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>. His position of not cooperating
                            with <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> is well known and he holds to
                            it. Questioned about kind of electoral law he favored, Papandreou said
                            it makes no difference whether simple or reinforced proportional system
                            used. He wanted only return to normality. Regarding a person who could
                            head an interim government, he quipped Greece already has an interim
                            government with <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>.
                            Who heads a government, whether Kanellopoulos or <persName corresp="#p_ZZ1">Zolotas</persName>, is not significant. Important
                            point is need for statement regarding free and honest elections.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Comment:</p>
                        <p>1. If he means it, Papandreou's suggestion that King could have voice in
                            selection of DefMin in any future Papandreou government represents shift
                            from his earlier position. It was ostensibly on this issue that
                            Papandreou broke with King in July 1965. That he should now propose a
                            “mutually acceptable” DefMin suggests he currently sees himself caught
                            in dilemma between aggressive harshness of positions taken by his son
                            Andreas and continuing opposition to elections by Palace and other
                            elements <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0540"/>who fear what Andreas
                            would do to Greece. There are some qualified observers who believe that
                            in recent weeks George Papandreou has indeed (as he stated to me) become
                            seriously concerned for the political future of Greece and who assert
                            that his remarks on July 23 and his approving comments on the August 6
                            Mavros open letter to the King (see Weeka #32 August 13)<note n="2" xml:id="d236fn2">Not printed. (Ibid., Central Files, POL 2–1
                                GREECE)</note> must be interpreted as a deliberate effort to
                            separate himself from more violent statements of Andreas.</p>
                        <p>2. Papandreou looked alert and seemingly now in good health. Nonetheless,
                            several times he showed his awareness time remaining for his active
                            political leadership may be short. Though he repeatedly asserted he now
                            controls all elements of party, I inferred that he realizes this is no
                            longer true, particularly with regard to his son Andreas. This could
                            account for his expressed desire to re-establish communications (on his
                            own terms) with King while he is still in charge.</p>
                        <p>3. Papandreou has various means, other than the American Embassy, by
                            which he can communicate his views to King. He may well see certain
                            tactical advantage in trying to involve us in kind of middle-position
                            between Kastri and Palace. He also is undoubtedly aware that, during
                            course two conversations with Andreas in recent weeks,<note n="3" xml:id="d236fn3">No record of these conversations has been
                                found.</note>
                            <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> urged Andreas (with obvious lack of
                            success) to soften his attack on Palace in order help create conditions
                            which would advance possibilities for inevitable elections. My
                            conversation with George Papandreou might have been regarded by him as
                            opportunity to get American influence actively in support of early
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>4. At appropriate early occasion I propose to inform Palace of Papandreou
                            proposal, but without comment.<note n="4" xml:id="d236fn4">Talbot
                                informed the Palace of Papandreou's views in a meeting with
                                Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>, Chief of
                                the Royal Protocol Office, on August 18. He reported his talk with

                                from Athens, August 22. (Department of State, Central Files, POL
                                GREECE)</note> Palace, like Embassy, will not fail to have most
                            serious reservations because of discrepancy between George Papandreou's
                            comments to me and statements of Andreas Papandreou whose speeches over
                            weekend were even more acerbic and aggressive toward King and more
                            inflammatory in revolutionary tone. Nevertheless, I would hope Palace
                            would find in Papandreou's remarks to me encouragement to establish
                            dialogue directly with Papandreou through its own channels.</p>
                        <p>5. However, over and above the question of George Papandreou's sincerity
                            and his willingness and ability to disengage himself from Andreas'
                            policies, the Palace is faced with a more fundamental dilemma. This
                            dilemma is whether Greek national interests and the particular interests
                            of Palace would be better served a) by indefinitely postponing
                            elections, notwithstanding increasingly vicious attacks of Andreas and
                                <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503" facs="0541"/>risk of aggravation of
                            question of the regime, in the hope that George Papandreou will
                            disappear as an active political force and that CU will then fragment or
                            b) by accelerating elections before position of Andreas in CU can be
                            further consolidated and while the moderate elements in CU, presumably
                            including George Papandreou, still have an important position.
                            Ironically, increasing violence of Andreas may in fact precipitate
                            elections before Andreas will have been able to achieve effective
                            control of the CU.</p>

                                TUR–US)</note> implies Turkey intends to view U.S. support for
                            Turkish position as touchstone U.S.-Turkish relations. Further
                            discussions while <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s at <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> might elucidate this.</p>
                        <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0542"/>
                        <p>3. Revelations volunteered so far give inadequate basis for judging
                            utility of U.S. re-entry into negotiations along lines <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is about to propose. My net impression,
                            however, is that Greece and Turkey have not yet exhausted their
                            maneuvering room in current dialogue. It would follow that they should
                            be pushed to try harder to reach a settlement. Our basket is already
                            pretty full and they have at least as much interest as we in peace in
                            Eastern Mediterranean. In any event U.S. ability to exert influence
                            toward settlement would depend on what U.S. would be prepared to do or
                            not to do to bring Turkish position nearer to conditions that could be
                            imposed on Greece and Greek Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>4. However, since demise of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> government could bring Greek-Turkish
                            negotiations to grinding halt, we have interest in seeing dialogue move
                            as rapidly as possible. It may be long time before we again see
                            combination as constructively committed to resolution of Greek-Turkish
                            difficulties as are <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>-Caglayangil and <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>-Toumbas. Also, it would be brash to
                            forecast how much longer extraordinary secrecy so far maintained in
                            dialogue can continue. When leaks start, public reactions could build up
                            rapidly. For these reasons, I hope we can be in position to offer
                            assistance such as Ambassador Bunker's services on very short notice if
                            two parties demonstrate willingness to take his suggestions
                            seriously.</p>
                        <p>5. I gather Caglayangil may involve U.S. assistance for interim solution.
                            In considering whether there would be opportunity for constructive U.S.
                            action along this line, we should keep in mind several factors: (1)
                            status quo (including presence <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>) is almost impossible to freeze precisely.
                            Negotiating interim solution would therefore involve some of same
                            compromises regarding internal structure as would permanent settlement;
                            (2) unless basic revisions of Zurich-London could be agreed upon as
                            basis of interim solution, which seems unlikely, Treaty of Guarantee and
                            possibility of Turkish intervention under Article IV would continue to
                            exacerbate Greek-Turkish relations; (3) under interim solution Cyprus
                            would presumably remain independ-ent, in which case Greeks are convinced
                            Ankara would have to address itself to Nicosia rather than Athens and
                            negotiate with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> considers interim solution just as
                            difficult to negotiate as permanent one. I would tend to agree.</p>
                        <p>6. Nor am I sanguine about peaceful prospects of solution of “unfettered”
                            independence. In that event, Cyprus would seem likely immediately to
                            become cockpit of international struggle. Soviets and non-aligneds would
                            develop sudden vested interest in preserving Cyprus as uncommitted
                            country outside <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> area.
                            Simultaneously Greeks (with or without government inspiration or
                            support) would undoubtedly mount strident, intensive campaign for quick
                            referendum to bring enosis. Presumably Turks would regard such Greek
                            actions as <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0543"/>betrayal of
                            understanding, and might reserve right to counteract. In one case we
                            could be confronted with serious derogation of Western interests in
                            Cyprus area; in other, with sharpened bitterness between Turkey and
                            Greece. “Unfettered” independence with prior implicit Turkish
                            acquiescence in enosis campaign would be a different thing, and might be
                            workable compromise.</p>
                        <p>7. With reference to <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>
                            report that Greeks and Turks are discussing disposition of Dhekelia base
                            area, this at least is progress over 1964 Karpas Peninsula debate which
                            if raised now would in my opinion be non-starter. Question of nature of
                            Turkish rights in base area would be closely related to issue of
                            demilitarization of Cyprus along Dodecanese lines. A Turkish military
                            base on a demilitarized island would seem anomalous, though Turks would
                            presumably find restriction to Dhekelia less attractive if rest of
                            island were within Greek active border defense zone. It may be that
                            Dhekelia issue can be resolved only within context of an Acheson-style
                            Greek-Turkish defense board, a device by which defense needs of Cyprus
                            could be reduced to proper proportions.</p>
                        <p>As to form of enosis, we here have been pondering idea of commonwealth
                            along Puerto Rican line. From Greek (and U.S.) point of view this would
                            have serious deficiency of leaving <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in saddle internally while making Greece
                            responsible to Turks and rest of world for policy pursued in Cyprus.
                            Nonetheless, if idea of enosis is still shocker to Turks, commonwealth
                            theme might be worth examining by both parties despite Greek resistance
                            to getting committed to anything short of full enosis.</p>
                        <p>9. I advance these random thoughts at this time on assumption Department
                            will in immediate future be intensively considering next steps.<note n="4" xml:id="d237fn4">In telegram 48821, September 16, the

                        <p>1. In light Secretary's conversation with Caglayangil and in anticipation
                            his forthcoming meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>, I am putting down these thoughts to clarify a
                            few points in hope this message may be useful to Secretary before
                            meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>.</p>
                        <p>2. It seems agreed among us (Athens, Nicosia and Dept) that present
                            Turk-Greek dialogue offers best hope for permanent settlement of Cyprus
                            issue for some time to come. We also recognize that sincerity of both
                            sides and secrecy of talks are good omen. Our fear lest dialogue fail if
                            Greek Government should fall encourages me to believe that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should use available time to make
                            concerted effort to contribute to success of present negotiations.</p>
                        <p>3. I realize that we have been well burned before in trying to mediate
                            Cyprus problem and are therefore reluctant to let ourselves be dragged
                            into the middle.</p>
                        <p>4. In present circumstances, we are also handicapped by lack of
                            knowledge. We have some idea of Greek proposals and of Greek attitude
                            toward Turkish reactions. We do not have any idea of Turkish proposals
                            nor specific Turkish attitude to Greek proposals nor of Nicosia's likely
                            attitude to either side's position. We really do not know how close or
                            far apart the two sides are on any issue.</p>
                        <p>5. We should probably recognize that our decision to intervene in
                            Turk-Greek negotiations may well be based less on careful assessment
                            that we can help bridge relatively narrow gap in two sides' respective
                            positions than on sheer hunch and on feeling that we cannot turn down
                            plea for help from two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies who
                            come to us as fair and impartial friend after having virtually exhausted
                            their own resources.</p>
                        <p>6. If Caglayangil and <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> meet
                            in New York at end of September, their meeting should give us important
                            indication whether talks losing momentum. Despite certain urgency, I
                            would recommend that we await results of that meeting and evaluation of
                            subsequent situation by respective Foreign Ministers before taking any
                            steps (known to parties) to help out dialogue.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0545"/>
                        <p>7. If after that meeting both Foreign Ministers agree on U.S. taking
                            active role in dialogue, I believe that will be propitious time for
                            offering services of experienced figure like Ambassador Bunker. In
                            regard to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> we should
                            focus hard on any suggestion Embassy Nicosia may have which could help
                            us neutralize his talent for upsetting applecart.<note n="3" xml:id="d238fn3">In telegram 410 from Nicosia, September 19, Belcher
                                commented that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                                might prove more amenable to talks as a result of the perception
                                that time was favoring the plans of the Turkish Cypriots.

                        </p>
                        <p>8. On balance, time is approaching when we shall have to take risk of
                            more active involvement if we are seriously concerned about alternatives
                            to peaceful accommodation. Attitude of Turks and Greeks in this dialogue
                            since June gives me some ground for optimism that we may be able to help
                            them, and Cypriots, to find some way out on Cyprus issue. I therefore
                            wish to reaffirm line expressed by Secretary to Caglayangil that we are
                            prepared to seize opportunity for constructive action.</p>
                        <p>9. I will have more to say later on detail of various proposals.</p>

                        <p>2. Greek Foreign Minister, speaking on Cyprus issue, said he believed
                            strongly in Greek-Turk dialogue and tensions in Greek-Turk relations had
                            relaxed. It essential to seek permanent solution which would not have in
                            it germ of new difficulties. Greek position based on three principles:
                            1) protection of prestige of Turkey, 2) granting of most advanced and
                            generous type of minority guarantees, 3) guarantee of <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0546"/>Turk security. Agreement of course
                            extremely difficult to reach and there were those in Greece, Turkey and

                            by Greeks covers 1) Cyprus solution, 2) bilateral treaty of alliance
                            within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> framework, 3) commercial
                            and industrial relations, 4) fisheries, 5) tourism, 6) cultural
                            relations. He added, without going into detail, that final solution
                            should take form of “some kind of enosis.” Independence raised all
                            dangers of Cuba-like Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>3. Soviets, he is convinced, oppose solution and as example he noted that
                            Soviet Charge on Cyprus had expressed view that “opinion poll” be taken
                            on question of enosis among young people who had not participated in
                            1950 plebiscite. Soviets obviously hope exploit expected shift in
                            sentiment which <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> said was
                            not anti-Greek but anti-West. A nation of only five hundred thousand
                            cannot avoid falling into sphere of influence of one of great powers if
                            independent.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> stated Greek and Turk
                            representatives holding another meeting this week. Foreign Minister
                            added he neither optimistic nor pessimistic about outcome of dialogue
                            but wanted to continue to hope for best. He asked if Greek efforts fail
                            and there is breakdown in talks, what would US consider doing
                            procedurally? He had in mind good offices.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary thanked Foreign Minister for report. He was encouraged to
                            see talks being carried on seriously and privately. He thought Greeks
                            had achieved one very important thing which <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> esteemed highly, namely creating atmosphere of
                            restraint. He noted Turk Foreign Minister had said his Greek colleague
                            dealing on this subject in serious and responsible way. Secretary urged
                            dialogue continue and not be broken off, since consequences of failure
                            would be very serious. Utmost patience and determination were required
                            and if talks did not succeed today there is always tomorrow. Cyprus
                            question of interest not only to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus but to all of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had used its good
                            offices in past and had suffered many bruises from this endeavor.
                            Therefore we do not want to rush in. Secretary then made three points:
                            1) every possible effort should be made to maintain peace on island; 2)
                            Greeks and Turks should exert maximum effort to work towards solution,
                            3) if there are ways in which US might be of help, we would be glad to
                            give it most serious consideration. Secretary added he was not sure we
                            had expertise or miraculous formula to solve Cyprus problem and that
                            roots of problem go back into history to before birth of US as a nation.
                            He believed strongly that those who had to live with results of solution
                            should be ones to find it and he had complete respect for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> efforts in this regard.</p>
                        <p>6. At end of meeting Secretary stated he hoped to see Foreign Minister
                            again in New York, particularly if there were any future developments
                                <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0547"/>on Cyprus issue. Secretary
                            noted that not having pressed for details concerning dialogue was
                            through no lack of interest in problem but because we feel private
                            conversations are most fruitful.</p>

                            Caglayangil and <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> before
                                <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> and their further contacts in
                            New York have diminished sense of urgency about what U.S. role should be
                            in event of break of Turk-Greek talks. Nevertheless, it may be useful
                            for Embassy to record certain current impressions.</p>
                        <p>2. In reviewing messages re Turk-Greek talks, Embassy is struck by fact
                            that only solid information has been provided by high Greek sources to
                            Embassy Athens. We must remain cautious however lest these sources
                            without malice aforethought may have misrepresented Turkish
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>3. We also assume that both Greek and Turk positions at outset are
                            superficially irreconcilable. We would therefore not wish to encourage
                            idea that initial Greek positions may eventually be acceptable to Turkey
                            or that initial Turk positions are unalterable.</p>
                        <p>4. We are inclined to believe, for example, that Turkish Government would
                            be in deep trouble if it accepted full enosis of Cyprus with Greece and
                            participation in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base, as
                            suggested by <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> (para
                            4 Athens 1293).<note n="3" xml:id="d240fn3">See <ref target="#d237fn2">footnote 2, Document 237</ref>.</note> If Turks are to hold
                            sovereignty over base area and can obtain nearly complete
                            demilitarization of island outside base area, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> might be interested. However, we note Greek <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> rejected this (para 2 Athens
                            1293).</p>
                        <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0548"/>
                        <p>5. When Caglayangil told Secretary enosis would be “difficult
                            proposition” (State 46636),<note n="4" xml:id="d240fn4">See <ref target="#d237fn3">footnote 3, Document 237</ref>.</note> it may
                            have been form of politeness to avoid appearing rigid. On other hand,
                            Turks have long been favorable to idea of double enosis but reject
                            unilateral enosis. Adjective qualifying enosis is important.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> may also have in mind
                            interim solution which would freeze status quo with aim perhaps of
                            preventing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from
                            undertaking new initiatives pending further negotiations on permanent
                            settlement. While we are aware of problems involved, interim solution
                            might provide for certain Turk and Greek steps to ease tension and
                            increase mutual confidence during period that Cyprus still remains
                            independent state. It might not go so far as to take up Cyprus
                            constitutional-legal problems and might therefore be easier to negotiate
                            than permanent settlement.</p>
                        <p>7. Yet another possibility in which we see benefit is “limited accord”
                            which in itself resolves nothing but has merit of maintaining suitable
                            atmosphere for difficult negotiations. Such accord might provide for
                            continued secrecy of talks, agreement on attitude toward press,
                            immediate consultation on new bilateral and Cyprus issues vital to each
                            side, periodic high-level meetings of political leaders, etc.</p>
                        <p>8. In reviewing various ideas ranging from “unfettered independence” to
                            double enosis to commonwealth and condominium, we must take into account
                            Turkish four principles. Any permanent solution must be susceptible of
                            being interpreted as fulfilling more or less these four principles.
                            These were described by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> in
                            Ankara 858 of January 28<note n="5" xml:id="d240fn5">

                        </p>
                        <p>A. No domination of one community by the other. Permanent solution
                            probably must grant Turk Cypriots broad rights to administer themselves,
                            at least approaching what they now have within enclaves.</p>
                        <p>B. No unilateral modification of London-Zurich treaties. Permanent
                            solution must acknowledge this point even in process of throwing
                            treaties to the winds and establishing new constitutional-legal
                            framework which would still give Turk Cypriots role in central
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>C. No unilateral enosis. Permanent solution must include turning over to
                            Turkey some land in compensation for enosis. Turk-Greek negotiators may
                            have to bargain hard on which piece of land (Evros River area, Aegean
                            offshore island, Karpas Peninsula, Dhekelia base etc.) should be turned
                            over on what basis (Turk sovereignty, joint Turk-Greek sovereignty, <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0549"/>long-term lease from Greece to
                            Turkey, temporary <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> arrangement,
                            etc.).</p>
                        <p>D. Maintenance of the balance established by Lausanne Treaty. This
                            suggests that developments on Cyprus are of strategic interest to Turkey
                            and position of Turk Cypriot community cannot be ignored.</p>
                        <p>9. For time being, we have no special formula to suggest. In absence of
                            precise knowledge as to Turkish position, we believe we should merely
                            continue stressing that it is to Greek and Turkish advantage to push
                            talks toward settlement. As stated above we see no danger at present of
                            an imminent breakdown and are therefore reluctant to speculate too far
                            afield on possible compromise formulas for settlement.</p>

                        <p>At a luncheon at Kastri at which I was the only guest, George and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> were at
                            pains to get across three messages. The first was that the CU will not
                            make a popular front with the Communist-line <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and cannot do so because of policy disagreements over
                            legalization of the Communist Party of Greece, return to Greece of
                            refugees from the guerrilla war, Greek membership in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and the national democratic
                            political character of the Center Union. Secondly, they asserted that
                            Greece under a Papandreou Government would remain a staunch ally of
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the West, though—to use
                            Andreas' words—Greece would insist that its voice be heard more than in
                            the past. Andreas expressed his admiration for Turkish diplomacy as the
                            way <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0550"/>for a small country to
                            project its views in the councils of powers. Third, the Papandreous
                            proposed that the King install a service government which would (a) be
                            set up with non-political personalities agreed upon by the Center Union
                            and <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>, (b) gain a vote of confidence
                            for a restricted period and for the restricted purpose of adopting an
                            electoral law (presumably by the simple proportional system), and (c) be
                            in power for long enough to adopt the electoral law before the beginning
                            of the 45-day period provided by the constitution for the holding of
                            elections. The Papandreous thought that this procedure, based on a
                            precedent established in 1958 with the Georgakopoulos Government, would
                            add “a few weeks” to the life of the service government. For the first
                            time in my discussions with George Papandreou, he ruled out the
                            possibility of an interim <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> government
                            and emphasized that only a “service government” of non-political
                            personalities would be acceptable.</p>

                        <p>1. During course of long private conversation Oct 21 <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil brought up his last
                            private talk with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>
                            in Washington,<note n="2" xml:id="d242fn2">See <ref target="#d237fn3">footnote 3, Document 237</ref>.</note> during which he stated
                            he had told Secretary that while <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had
                            little confidence in results, it was continuing its secret bilateral
                            conversations with Greece on Cyprus. Since that talk there had been no
                            real closing of gap in basic views. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>, despite his good will and very correct and
                            sincere attitude, was shying away from the bases [garble] durable and
                            final solution. Politics of Greece restricted him and he appeared intent
                            on gaining time in view of Greece's internal concerns. <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0551"/>Greeks in general were insisting on
                            enosis which could not be accepted by Turkish opposition, which was
                            “cruel” and would say that if enosis was to be solution it could have
                            yielded that concession to Greece itself, when in power. “Form of enosis
                            was not Turkish affair” Caglayangil said and apparently Greeks had to
                            have some form of enosis. As matter of fact, bilateral Greek-Turk talks
                            had not yet included any discussion of enosis or political ties of
                            Cyprus. Each side had at once identified “unacceptable” proposals and by
                            mutual consent these had been set aside and dialogue focused on such
                            matters as demilitarization of island, rights of Turk Cypriots and a
                            base to guard Turkish community. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had
                            recently insisted that Greece set forth its definite opinion on one
                            vital element: a statute for Turkish forces on the island. If Greece
                            could clarify its position on this matter dialogue could be continued,
                            but <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had no hope that this could be
                            done. If dialogue should produce no results (and in a short time Turkey
                            would know) this would constitute a rupture.</p>
                        <p>2. Recalling breakfast meeting with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> at Ankara in April,<note n="3" xml:id="d242fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d230">Document 230</ref>.</note> Caglayangil
                            referred to Turkish aide-mémoire in which it made clear (and in
                            accompanying conversation) that some “normalization” and “equalization”
                            of Turk-Cypriot position on island must be undertaken. Disparity in
                            rights between the two communities was totally objectionable and unfair.
                            While Greeks were free to come and go everywhere on island, Turks were
                            subjected to harassments, restrictions, assaults, and blockades. It was
                            not humane. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> had
                            agreed with Caglayangil in private portion of Washington meeting that
                            there must be some normalization and avoidance of restriction on human
                            rights. Now winter was approaching and situation could not be allowed to
                            go on. If <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> were in position to tell
                            Turk Cypriots that everything would be settled in six months and they
                            should therefore be patient, that would be one thing. But Turkey could
                            not give such assurance. If it should come to point where <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had to demand from <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> removal of restrictions
                            imposed on Turk Cypriot community then <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could be obliged to act to ensure compliance.</p>
                        <p>3. In response to my request for clarification status of dialogue,
                            Caglayangil confirmed dialogue not ruptured but continuing as of now. If
                            Greek reply to Turkish request regarding a base for Turkish troop
                            presence on Cyprus “approached” Turkish point of view there would be
                            possibility of further contact, for example, between Caglayangil and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>. If not, there was no
                            utility in prolonging dialogue.</p>
                        <p>4. There ensued long discussion, during which I emphasized first and
                            foremost importance of continuing this dialogue and not having rupture.
                            I said we estimate that present <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            while fragile was best govt in Greece foreseeable at present in its
                            attitude toward Cyprus problem. I <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0552"/>asked whether he had given thought to possibility of
                            keeping talks in some status of continuation despite lack of progress
                            and perhaps in establishing something like “hot line” to be used with
                            Athens if events on Cyprus became serious. Caglayangil responded that he
                            had, but there must be condition that there be some improvement in
                            Cyprus situation. He agreed it would be most undesirable to “declare”
                            that there had been rupture of the talks. It might even trigger fall of
                            present Greek Govt. However, there continued in Cyprus harassments,
                            inability of Turk Cypriots to cultivate their lands, to circulate
                            freely, and he stressed time and again need for assurance that Turkish
                            aid to Turk Cypriots could get through to people. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> had agreed with him on this.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> “had no desire to arm Turk
                            Cypriots”. Arms had been too long held by both sides and shootings were
                            chronic and irresponsible on both sides. What he objected to most was
                            inequality of treatment. I said it had been my impression, and I felt I
                            had received every important communication sent to Washington by our
                            Embassy in Nicosia, that situation, while far from “normal” was
                            nevertheless distinctly better than it had been few months ago.</p>
                        <p>There had been recent postal agreement. He nodded. Little by little and
                            very painfully I thought some of elements in situation were being
                            diminished. I asked whether in view of this situation on island could
                            justify breaking off dialogue. Caglayangil seemed to agree, but then
                            backed away to say situation not basically improved. He referred to
                            sudden blockadings of Turk Cypriots under blanket accusation they were
                            responsible for forest fires or explosions. He said <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had issued most categoric instructions
                            to Turk Cypriots not to fall into provocations. As regards explosions
                            and shootings, he knew they occurred sporadically and were started by
                            both sides. “For all I know”, he said, “Turks may be to blame for an
                            explosion but Greeks should not without awaiting investigation and under
                            general influence of prejudice declare publicly Turk Cypriots to blame
                            and then blockade some Turk Cypriot community. This is inhuman.”</p>
                        <p>5. Caglayangil volunteered <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> not trying
                            to rush final solution. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> understood
                            that “right now” Greece could not talk about partition and “right now”
                            Turkey could not talk about enosis. As far as Turkey was concerned
                            conversations could go on for another year or two years, or a modus
                            vivendi worked out if situation on island could be made to improve, but
                            this situation had had profound repercussions on Turkish public opinion.
                            I then asked whether I could define his position as this: “If there
                            could be some real sign in improvement in situation on Cyprus this would
                            help him in justifying prolongation of dialogue.” He agreed.</p>
                        <p>6. I then said that he had referred to free access of Turks to their
                            lands. One very important point which concerned me was whether Turk
                            Cypriot leadership would permit Turk Cypriots to circulate freely to and
                                <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0553"/>from enclaves if Greek
                            Cypriots permitted it. I had been disturbed over stories that Turk
                            Cypriot judges had been actively dissuaded by local Turk authorities
                            from resuming their positions on bench. Caglayangil made clear it was
                            Turk Cypriot community not Turkish Government that dissuaded them and
                            that judges did not wish to return. I said it very important to know
                            whether, if Greek Cypriots dropped restrictions on movement of Turks,
                            e.g. to return to their own lands (to which I understand they had been
                            invited by GOC anyway), they would be permitted to do so and not
                            prevented. Caglayangil replied that he could give me fullest assurance
                            on this point. I said I proposed to relay this to Washington and he
                            said, “Please do.”</p>
                        <p>7. When I asked Caglayangil specifically what he was suggesting we do, he
                            again referred to private conversation with Secretary and said he had
                            been “greatly encouraged” that Secretary had agreed with him that
                            improvement of Turk Cypriot situation must somehow be found. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> needed assurance that Turk Cypriots
                            would have access to port facilities, that they could build some decent
                            housing, that Turk relief could get through. He was very concerned that
                            if he had no alternative but to demand from <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> lifting of restrictions confrontation would
                            take place from which Turkey [garble] not possibly back down. There was
                            “question of prestige of a country of 31 million against this small
                            island.”</p>
                        <p>8. As we had carried on this conversation for well over an hour out of
                            total conversation of two and one-half hours, I said I would like to
                            mull all this over and come back to see him soon.</p>
                        <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>“Procedural agreement” does not appear sufficient in itself to stop
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> confrontation if <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> dialogue lapses,
                            even if not declared ruptured. Caglayangil obviously in dilemma over his
                            posture on Cyprus problem on eve opening of Parliament and expected
                            opposition probes and heckling. I think it clear he wants to declare
                            dialogue still on. He needs badly evidences of clear improvement
                            Turk-Cypriot situation and hopes Washington can back Athens in
                            pressuring Govt of Cyprus.</p>

                        <p>In taking my leave of the King before Washington consultation, I
                            mentioned the prospective visits to Athens of several U.S. Congressional
                            groups. The King said he would particularly like to see Senator Javits
                            and might even challenge him to a tennis match.</p>
                        <p>The King said he understood Admiral <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> had told me about current Greek-Turkish
                            negotiations on Cyprus and had said the time might be approaching when
                            it would be important for the U.S. to exercise some moderating influence
                            on Turkey. I commented that I had asked the Foreign Minister whether he
                            had any particular issue or timing in mind and he had replied not at
                            present. I added that I had gained the impression from the Prime
                            Minister in a separate conversation that the key sticking point seemed
                            to be the status of the Dhekelia sovereign base area. The King said this
                            was his understanding. I asked whether he would expect the negotiations
                            to break down over such an issue as a Turkish base versus a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base with Turkish participation.
                            “Absolutely within this room,” he replied, “I have told the Government
                            they can't let that be the final breaking point. It wouldn't work to
                            have obtained 95% and stick on the last 5%”. However, he went on, Greece
                            could not accept the present Turkish demand for a Turkish sovereign base
                            combined with demilitarization of the Greek part of the island. One of
                            these two elements would have to be modified. He hoped that the Turks
                            could be persuaded to accept a lease status in Dhekelia. I noted that
                            this might be exceptionally difficult if the Turkish mood continued
                            anything like it was in 1964 when <persName corresp="#p_AD1">Acheson</persName> got nowhere in his effort to persuade the Turks
                            that in today's volatile world a long-term lease is just as good as
                            sovereignty. The King commented that in any case the two governments
                            were still negotiating on this point. The heartening fact was <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0555"/>that both governments seemed
                            now to be showing a sense of urgency. That was new.</p>
                        <p>If the negotiators should reach an agreement, the King foresaw that the
                            problem for Greece would be how to get a national decision and then, of
                            course, how to deal with “the Priest.” I commented that I had supposed
                            that the Archbishop could be dealt with much more successfully in the
                            context of a Greek-Turkish settlement than when Greece and Turkey were
                            at odds. The King repeated that a Turkish base on Cyprus would be a very
                            difficult thing to make <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            swallow. On the Greek side, he said, the question was whether Papandreou
                            could be brought along. In any case, the present government could not
                            carry the burden of a settlement alone; the decision would have to be
                            put up to all the parties. If each party were forced to make its stand
                            known to the public, even the “Old Man” (Papandreou) might pause before
                            rejecting it. However, this would not be an easy matter to get over and
                            if worse came to worst Greece would at least show the Turks which
                            elements in Greek political life had sabotaged the settlement.</p>
                        <p>The King asked whether I thought the British would go along with cession
                            of Dhekelia. He had understood that in the end they would. I said this
                            was also my impression; I had in fact been somewhat worried for fear the
                            British financial crisis might cause a premature movement by London,
                            such as an announcement of future withdrawals similar to that made on
                            Aden, which would reduce the base area's bargaining importance in the
                            Greek-Turk negotiations. The King said he would try to find an
                            opportunity to caution some people in London about the delicacy of the
                            present situation when he goes there next week.</p>
                        <p>“And just as soon as the Cyprus issue is settled,” the King added with a
                            twinkling eye, “I'll make an official visit to the United States.” I
                            said that he would be most welcome at that time, and that I agreed there
                            were good reasons for not planning such a trip while the issue is
                            unresolved.</p>
                        <p>The King had little to add to the comments he had made to me on October
                            27 about the Greek domestic situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d243fn2">A
                                memorandum of Talbot's October 27 conversation with the King is
                                ibid. The King gave his opinions on government press subsidies,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>, and
                                the Aspida affair.</note> He expressed himself as very well pleased
                            at the way things had gone in Thessaloniki. The Prime Minister had also
                            been pleased, he said, with his reception in Macedonian villages. Things
                            seemed relatively quiet in the country and if in fact there should be a
                            Cyprus settlement it ought to be possible to move to elections very
                            quickly. I noted that people such as Markezinis felt that elections in
                            the context of a Cyprus settlement would have a different and much
                            healthier flavor than otherwise. The King agreed that in those <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0556"/>circumstances public attention
                            could be turned away from the issue unfortunately now so prominent.</p>
                        <p>The King commented that he had been to the Greek Pentagon for a military
                            briefing and that the projections for 1970–71 showed serious if not
                            critical shortfalls in the Hellenic military proficiency. The projected
                            military assistance program was just not adequate to meet the needs,
                            though he assumed that once Vietnam was settled the prospects might
                            improve. I replied that Vietnam is certainly an important factor in our
                            overall defense posture, but that Congressional attitudes and growing
                            Greek capabilities also have to be considered. On the first, I noted
                            that for reasons good or bad the trend line of military aid, like that
                            of economic aid, is going down. In addition, particular Congressional
                            sensitivity has grown over the military assistance programs to countries
                            seemingly on collision courses with their neighbors. The India-Pakistan
                            war had, of course, stimulated adverse Congressional reactions, but the
                            problems of military assistance to Arab countries and Israel and to
                            Greece and Turkey had also been featured in last year's Congressional
                            hearings. However, a Greek-Turkish rapprochement might ameliorate that
                            situation. “Yes,” the King responded, “that's another reason we must get
                            a settlement with Turkey.”</p>
                        <p>The King said he would be back in Greece on November 16.</p>

                                Turkish base. (Ibid.)</note> re his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>. Using most emphatic
                            Greek, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said there was
                            absolutely no possibility now or in future that he would agree to

                            When I asked him whether he felt same way about possible <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base in which Turks could participate
                            as part of multilateral force along with Greeks and perhaps others, he
                            said this was different matter and he did not object to concept.<pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0557"/> He expressed doubt, however,
                            that Turks would accept such proposal if <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> made it in connection with dialogue. (According to

                            replied in negative suggesting that probable meeting between <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> and Caglayangil in Paris might

                            secretly on 13 December 1966 at the home of one of its members,

                            “Revolutionary Council,” is composed of the following military

                                One of the group's leaders, Lieutenant Colonel Georgios
                                Papadopoulos, stated on 22 November that if the political situation

                                dictatorship, will be needed. [Footnote in the source text. The

                            selecting a single leader for the group was also discussed but it was
                            finally decided to leave the direction of the group in the hands of the

                            returned from Paris strongly heartened by tone and apparent progress
                            achieved in his extended discussions with Caglayangil. For first time he
                            felt optimistic that Greek-Turkish agreement could be reached by careful
                            negotiation. Believing that Turks anxious to settle and get rid of
                            Cyprus issue, he had telephoned Caglayangil in Ankara when <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> government fell to assure
                            him Greece continues equally eager to settle issue.</p>
                        <p>2. As described by <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>, he and
                            Caglayangil started Paris meeting with each side putting down in writing
                            the basic principles underlying its position. As anticipated, this
                            exercise resulted in reaffirmation of Turkish insistence on condominium
                            or an independent Cyprus while Greece stood firmly for enosis. However,
                            once the record had been made he and Caglayangil went on in oral
                            discussions for another 10 hours in the course of which Caglayangil
                            proved not only willing but apparently anxious to explore doctrine of
                            enosis and what it would mean for Turk Cypriots and for Turkey. In their
                            discussion of enosis, <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>
                            discerned no issue that seemed likely to become a final sticking point
                            except question of a Turkish base area on island. Caglayangil had
                            insisted that Turkey would need to obtain sovereignty over Dhekelia base
                            area. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> had tried to
                            persuade him that in practical terms a lease for a number of years would
                            be just as valuable as sovereignty and also that Turkish needs could be
                            equally well served by an arrangement that put Dhekelia under a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> umbrella with Turkish, Greek, British
                            and perhaps other participation. Although they did not reach accord on
                            this point, <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> did not
                            believe it had brought them to the breaking point. On contrary, he felt
                            optimistic that with skillful negotiation agreement could be reached
                            even on this question.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> said he had returned to
                            Greece with the impression that Turks would definitely be prepared to
                            make a deal on basis of enosis once base question resolved. He described
                            mood of conversation as forthright and friendly throughout. On arrival
                            in Athens he had reported this to <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> and had predicted that agreement with
                            Turkey was within reach provided that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should not be brought into the <pb n="522" xml:id="pg_522" facs="0560"/>picture until the Athens-Ankara
                            settlement was final. He had also given press conference—though without
                            divulging details of talks—to correct false impression in Greek press
                            that Paris talks had ended in near collapse of dialogue.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> said he would make
                            similar reports to new Prime Minister Paraskevopoulos and to the King.
                            Except to them, he said, he would not reveal the contents of his talks
                            to anyone so that secrecy of dialogue and its future prospects could be
                            protected.</p>

                        <p>1. When I made initial call on Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> today I found Cyprus issue at top of his
                            mind. He said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> trying to persuade
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> not to distribute
                            Czech arms, and may call for U.S. assistance. He now preparing
                            communication to go to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            within few days and would decide on next steps after getting
                            Archbishop's reply.<note n="2" xml:id="d247fn2">On December 13, 1966,
                                Secretary-General Thant reported that the Cypriot Government had
                                confirmed the importation from Czechoslovakia of a quantity of arms
                                to be distributed to the Cyprus Police. (U.N. Doc. S/7611/Add.1)
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> agreed to delay
                                issuing the arms for 2 months.</note> I responded that we also much
                            concerned, as we have made clear in Nicosia and New York where as his
                            government knows, we have been pressing for effective <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action to defuse issue.</p>
                        <p>2. He reiterated his desire and intention to resume dialogue with Turks,
                            if Turks willing, but in response to my question said he had not yet
                            completed discussion with leaders of major parties on how far his
                            government could go in dialogue. I reminded him that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had not sponsored any particular plan
                            as best solution for Cyprus, but had repeatedly made clear its strong
                            belief that peace in Eastern Mediterranean can be <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0561"/>secured only when Greece and Turkey
                            have settled their problems. As in Arab-Israel and India-Pakistan
                            disputes, I said, time seems to be on no one's side. All would suffer
                            greatly if continuing failure to achieve solution should some day result
                            in an explosion. He insisted that he fully agrees, and that his strong
                            ambition is to move vigorously in direction of settlement with Turkey
                            while he is Prime Minister.</p>
                        <p>3. Prime Minister said he thought time probably not ripe for Greek Crown
                            Council to meet on Cyprus, but he would be examining this question also
                            with party leaders.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Political realities here make it clear
                            that <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> can move only
                            as far with Turkey as Kanellopoulos and George Papandreou will permit. I
                            have no fresh reading on Papandreou's private views, but Kanellopoulos
                            told me later today that he favors continuation of dialogue by <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> government. He expressed
                            himself as persuaded that settlement with Turkey can be obtained only if
                            both major Greek parties agree on terms. For that reason he believes
                            present period as propitious as any other for negotiations since both
                            parties support <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>
                            during current interim. At same time he showed himself still bearish on
                            chances of getting agreement, since he sees enosis as only basis Greek
                            parties can accept and professes to be unable to discover what sort of
                            compensation to Turkey could be devised that would be both payable by
                            Greeks and acceptable to Turks. Kanellopoulos favors early meeting of
                            Crown Council to get briefing on dialogue, though presumably not to set
                            guidelines for its continuation (Ankara's 3361).<note n="3" xml:id="d247fn3">Telegram 3361 from Ankara, January 16, summarized

                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> determination to resume dialogue
                            and, if possible, reach agreement on Cyprus problem. We are impressed by
                            persistence and sincerity with which <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            appears to be pursuing this objective, and consider <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> recognition that recent bellicose
                            statements in <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> Parliament are
                            designed for domestic consumption as further evidence their
                            sincerity.</p>
                        <p>2. As we perceive current situation, existence of <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> Government offers
                            opportunity for move forward on Cyprus issue. Main obstacle on Greek
                            side would be potential opposition of George Papandreou and his CU party
                            to any settlement which could be regarded as sacrificing Greek interests
                            (and since any conceivable settlement will involve Greek concessions,
                            such “sacrifices” will not be hard to identify). However, since
                            Papandreou has reasonable expectation of returning to power in May
                            elections, he is well aware of potentially destructive impact of Cyprus
                            issue on his popularity and existence his government and thus has every
                            reason to wish it out of way before he assumes office. As CU leader has
                            said to Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> in past,
                            Cyprus crisis was his greatest worry during his 16 months in office, and
                            preoccupation with this question prevented him from carrying out his
                            domestic policy which was closest to his heart. If <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> Govt. were able to reach
                            Cyprus settlement on terms representing something less than complete
                            success for Greek side, Papandreou could presumably acquiesce, since he
                            would not bear main responsibility for lack of total victory and would
                            be freed of this potential burden when and if he took office. Further he
                            would probably not begrudge current government credit for positive
                            aspects of Cyprus settlement, since <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> and his ministers are “non-political”
                            personalities and hence not his political rivals.</p>
                        <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>3. We recognize there is no way of preventing certain elements on Greek
                            political scene, notably <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> forces and crypto-Communist <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> party, from attacking efforts to
                            achieve Cyprus settlement on any realistic terms. Younger Papandreou has
                            shown his willingness in past to take irresponsible line on this
                            national issue when he considered it politically profitable.
                            Nevertheless, we think that on balance it is possible that sufficient
                            support from among party leaders—necessarily including G.
                            Papandreou—could be mustered to approve a Cyprus settlement which would
                            then be ratified by Crown Council. Powerful plus factor is determination
                            of King Constantine to settle Cyprus problem as quickly as possible, and
                            we would count on King to exert pressure on political leaders to this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>4. In light of this assessment you should seek early opportunity to
                            discuss with Caglayangil our analysis Greek situation, and our belief
                            that Greeks mean business on resuming dialogue and working towards final
                            settlement. While <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> skepticism about
                            current <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> ability to reach and
                            implement real agreement is understandable in view of past
                            disappointments with various Greek governments, this should not deter
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> from seizing what appears to be
                            opportunity to make significant progress on explosive Cyprus question.
                            At very least it would halt deterioration in Greek-Turkish relations
                            which has taken place since importation of Czech arms into island and
                            fall of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> Government,
                            and reestablish hot line between Athens and Ankara which would be most
                            helpful in event of further crisis.<note n="5" xml:id="d248fn5">In

                        <p>1. Turk Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_EM2">Esenbel</persName> said
                            Cyprus and Czech arms problem was one of three major subjects on which
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> had asked
                            him convey <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> views to Secretary.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> wanted Czech arms placed under
                            continuous <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody, considered
                            “control” measures offered through U Thant-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> agreement unsatisfactory, did not trust
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and lacked
                            confidence in Greek capacities to deal with him. Turkish people, he
                            added, were puzzled and frustrated in looking at Cyprus issue, and
                            although they basically tended to trust U.S., had been disappointed in
                            past U.S. attitudes. This was situation which leftists exploited.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>, he said, might be
                            compelled carry out openly and unapologetically measures such as airdrop
                            of weapons to Turk Cypriots if Czech arms distributed, although he hoped
                            to avoid it. With Cyprus problem one never knew what would happen.
                            Sooner a real solution was found, the better. Nevertheless, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> entertained doubts caretaker <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could negotiate seriously in resumed
                            dialogue.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary said U.S. had not invented Cyprus problem, U.S. not
                            guarantor power, yet it concerned us deeply. Requested <persName corresp="#p_EM2">Esenbel</persName> to convey personal, private
                            message to Caglayangil urging that Turk-Greek dialogue be resumed.
                            Secretary said earlier dialogue had revealed that both governments had
                            responsible, serious attitude. Caglayangil should not despair of present
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. Present attitude in Athens
                            appeared good, he said, and he suggested such non-political government
                            might possess advantages over successor government in seeking
                            constructive solution in which Greek compromises would be necessary.
                            Asked his personal comment be passed Caglayangil that little to lose and
                            possibly something to gain in resumed dialogue.</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary said he personally convinced <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> did not know of arms deal, and noted <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> actions to prevent distribution had
                            been timely. Secretary viewed <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>
                                Thant-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> arrangement
                            as retreat for <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. Abuse
                            of agreement would permit <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, U.S. and
                            others to move in vigorously. We are working hard in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and Nicosia to tighten agreement, but
                                <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss> Thant had accomplished something. In
                            urging U.S. to exert still greater pressures, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> was giving U.S. credit for more leverage than we
                            possessed. We cannot deliver on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he concluded, any more than Turks can.</p>

                        <p>1. In luncheon conversation January 25 George Papandreou seemed to me to
                            be in good spirits, more sure of himself and more durable over several
                            hours conversation than I have seen him in past year. He gave the
                            impression of a man who has gained electoral opportunity he had long
                            sought, and who intends to control his party despite pressures from his
                            son Andreas. His political comments being quoted by airgram.<note n="2" xml:id="d250fn2">Airgram A–400 from Athens, January 26. (Ibid., POL

                        </p>
                        <p>He also made following comments on Cyprus question.</p>
                        <p>2. He is not aware of substance of Athens-Ankara discussions. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> is scheduled to
                            brief him in next several days regarding dialogue so far. Presumably
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Papandreou and
                            Kanellopoulos to work out a consensus with <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> on what the two parties will support
                            with regard to continuation of dialogue before May elections.</p>
                        <p>3. Based on his reading of press reports, he does not believe dialogue
                            has progressed at all or has accomplished anything beyond relieving
                            tensions between Athens and Ankara while talks have continued. He
                            suspects dialogue in this case has been pseudonym for two monologues. He
                            would be pleased if <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> could report otherwise to him. He has no
                            objection to continuation of dialogue if he, Kanellopoulos and <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> agree among themselves
                            and with the Turks on meaning and intent of dialogue.</p>
                        <p>4. If his assumption regarding lack of progress on dialogue is correct,
                            he does not see possibility for arriving at agreed solution for present
                            and therefore believes it necessary to agree with Turks to suspend
                            attempts to reach final settlement for some time until situation has
                            become more relaxed.</p>
                        <p>5. His reasoning for inability to agree is as follows: (1) enosis: Turkey
                            will not agree unless there are territorial compensations, either in
                            Cyprus or in Greece (Thrace and islands) which Cypriot or Greek people
                            are unable to accept even though a government might desire to make the
                            concessions; (2) double enosis: this is equally unacceptable because of
                            resistance of Greek Cypriots to territorial concession this implies; (3)
                            independence: Turks insist on restricted independence of Zurich-London
                                <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0566"/>type which again is
                            unacceptable to Greeks because it precludes opportunity for opting for
                            union with Greece after 5, 10 or 20 years.</p>
                        <p>6. If this is case, Greeks and Turkey should work to agree not on final
                            settlement but on measures to keep situation on island under control. In
                            this context he sees need for Crown Council with participation of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. His reasoning for
                            inclusion <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is that
                            otherwise Greeks will make decision and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will assume role of judging whether decision is
                            proper. Roles should be reversed. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should participate in Crown Council discussions
                            and his forecast of coming events, Cyprus initiatives, etc. should be
                            made part of record, and discussed and whatever consensus possible
                            between Greeks and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            recorded. This is only way, in Papandreou's view, to “control” <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> initiatives. He kept
                            returning to what he considers greatest problem of moment on
                            Cyprus—state of enmity between <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and constant suspicions of former that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> is about to pull coup against
                            him. Because of this, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            considers every small act in terms of suspicion and insecurity for his
                            personal position. He thus lashes out in various ways, all for wrong
                            reason. If one could solve current “<persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> problem” one would have better chance of agreeing
                            with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on course of
                            action precluding initiatives of faits accomplis which only provoke
                            Turks.</p>

                            <item>Mr. Dimitrios Bitsios, Chief of the Royal Cabinet</item>
                            <item>Mr. John Maury, First Secretary</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>1. I had a one-hour private conversation with Dimitrios Bitsios following
                            a dinner at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Angelos Kanellopoulos on January
                            28. I gained the impression that Bitsios deliberately sought me out to
                            raise some of the matters noted below.</p>
                        <pb n="529" xml:id="pg_529" facs="0567"/>
                        <p>2. He began by commenting on the recent activities of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> and his friends,
                            remarking particularly upon what he interpreted as their use of the
                            Aspida trials to amplify their electoral campaign themes.<note n="2" xml:id="d251fn2">An October 1, 1966, report on Aspida had charged
                                    <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> with
                                involvement. On January 26, the court martial trying the officers
                                accused of participating in Aspida went into secret session. The
                                Center Union attacked this decision as a violation of the rights of
                                the accused and as an effort by the Greek Government to cover the
                                weakness of its case.</note> Bitsios went on to say that it now
                            seemed perfectly clear that Andreas was serving the purposes of the
                            Communists and the Soviets, and that it was thus hard to explain the
                            apparent American reluctance to face this fact. He added that reluctance
                            of the Embassy to become involved in internal political controversy
                            between the “national” parties was fully understood and accepted; but
                            that if the U.S. was serious about resisting Soviet aggrandizement and
                            internal Communist subversion, it should certainly be serious about
                            countering the activities of Andreas.</p>
                        <p>3. I responded that we may all have our suspicions about Andreas, but I
                            was aware of no solid evidence of collaboration between him and the
                            Soviets. I said that if such evidence existed we would be much
                            interested in it. Bitsios admitted that there was no “direct” evidence,
                            but he felt the “circumstantial” evidence was conclusive. He said he had
                            no doubt that Andreas was receiving generous financial support from
                            Moscow and from the KKE. When asked for details Bitsios said that money
                            was probably being provided through Greek business firms who had
                            lucrative contracts with the Soviets, and who, as a quid pro quo, were
                            forced to contribute to Andreas' coffers. Bitsios went on to reiterate
                            that everything that Andreas had said and done demonstrated his sympathy
                            with Communist and Soviet aims and his hostility to constitutional
                            government in Greece and to Western unity.</p>
                        <p>4. Bitsios then asked what I thought the U.S. reaction would be if the
                            “situation” required resort to “extreme measures.” I said if he were
                            speaking of unconstitutional measures, I was confident that U.S.
                            reaction would be extremely unfavorable. I pointed out that:</p>
                        <p>a. It is our general observation around the world that unconstitutional
                            measures rarely solve knotty political problems, and once such a course
                            is embarked upon it is difficult to turn back.</p>
                        <p>b. Whatever we may suspect of Andreas' motives and affiliations, there is
                            still no proof of active Communist or Soviet connections.</p>
                        <p>c. However Andreas may look to us from the perspective of Athens, the
                            fact remains that in the U.S. and perhaps in serveral other Western
                            countries, he has influential admirers in intellectual, political and
                            academic circles.</p>
                        <p>I added that there was the further question of whether a dictatorship
                            could be effectively imposed in the face of the kind of strikes,
                            violence <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0568"/>and general resistance
                            measures with which Andreas might react. Bitsios said that if a
                            dictatorshiop were decided upon, “Andreas would not be around.” In
                            response to my further question, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> said that for the present the loyalty of the
                            army could be relied upon to support a temporary dictatorship, but a few
                            years hence “it might be too late.”</p>
                        <p>5. I then asked <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> under what
                            conditions the situation might call for “such drastic measures.” He
                            replied that action would have to be taken, if at all, before rather
                            than after elections. (It was not clear whether he referred to the next
                            election or some future election from which Andreas might appear likely
                            to emerge with an absolute majority.)</p>
                        <p>6. I reiterated that whatever justification might be found here for an
                            unconstitutional solution, I saw no way in which it could be justified
                            in the eyes of the American public, press or political leaders. I said
                            that if Andreas was the threat that many believed him to be, it was
                            difficult to see why influential and responsible Greeks did not work
                            more vigorously against him. <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> agreed, deploring the lack of leadership in
                                <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> and among moderate elements in
                            the Center.</p>
                        <p>7. I asked <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>' views about the
                            possible return of former Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>. He replied that he
                            felt this was urgently needed “at the proper time” but was not clear on
                            just when this would be. He did, however, go out of his way to emphasize
                            that there is “absolutely no foundation” for rumors that <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>' return would not be
                            welcomed by the Palace. In response to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>' question, I said the nationalist elements
                            seemed much in need of leadership, vitality and unity; but whether
                                <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>' return now
                            would help to fill these needs was a question he could answer better
                            than I.</p>

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName>, citing Caglayangil
                            remarks of January 6 (Ankara's 3249)<note n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">Telegram 3249 from Ankara, January 7, reported Caglayangil's
                                statement to Parliament that Turkey retained its full right to
                                military intervention in Cyprus. (Ibid.)</note> and other evidence,
                            made opening statement which he summed up by saying Turkey insists on an
                            impossible solution (partition) by the use of force (invasion). Turkey
                            should be discouraged from the use of force, in his opinion, by the
                            US.</p>
                        <p>3. Secretary replied, in our view situation had been relatively calm on
                            the Island and efforts were being made to reach a solution when everyone
                            was surprised by the importation of arms. Those arms could only have one
                            purpose: to use against the Turkish Cypriots. He inquired about
                            arrangements with the Secretary General and said he had heard some arms
                            had been distributed for training.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> said arms not intended
                            for use against Turk Cypriots “because we have sufficient arms.” He
                            insisted on new rationalization: arms for police who have paramilitary
                            duties in defense of Island.</p>
                        <p>5. He claimed in discussions with SecGen latter had suggested small arms
                            distributed at end February, but not heavy arms which to be kept locked
                            and inspected. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had
                            replied we won't distribute arms of either type “for time being.”</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary said defense Cyprus depends on good sense of Greece and
                            Turkey, on the efforts of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and on
                            the support of nations interested in peace such as the US. Arms imported
                            by Cyprus would not have major effect in case of invasion. Fact they
                            came in surreptitiously made very unfortunate impression, especially if
                            police already had enough arms. He asked if it wise for <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> to ask US to seek assurances
                            from Turks without being able give US assurances on how arms would be
                            used. He emphasized <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> concerned about
                            attack on Turk Cypriots for whatever reason or pretext.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> said there was no sign
                            of GOC attack on Turk Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>8. Secretary inquired about SAM missiles. Suggested they were junk and
                            should be left where they were.</p>
                        <p>9. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> speaking personally
                            suggested “balance” whereby GOC would abandon missiles and import no
                            arms in return for which no invasion from Turkey.</p>
                        <p>10. Secretary said GOC not having taken US into confidence originally now
                            wanted US go to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> not knowing what
                            might be done on Cyprus tomorrow. Secretary asked if arms import had
                            been discussed with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> said not to his
                            knowledge. This sovereign matter. Many previous arms imports not
                            discussed.</p>

                            document to <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> who read
                            aloud para 1: “… all member States … to refrain from any action or
                            threat of action likely to worsen the situation in the sovereign
                            Republic of Cyprus …”</p>
                        <p>13. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> suggested since US
                            opposed use force it should oppose use force by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Secretary replied US equally against use force against
                            Turkish community.</p>
                        <p>14. Secretary emphasized that he had participated in discussions of
                            Cyprus for some years. There had been many suggestions about what US
                            should do. Henceforth he intended to ask each nation separately how it
                            could contribute towards keeping the peace.</p>
                        <p>15. <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> said GOC would leave
                            arms alone for time being, perhaps for some time, but if necessity arose
                            would have to use them sooner. GOC had right use arms.</p>
                        <p>16. Secretary said nations have many rights which they do not exercise in
                            interest avoiding international danger.</p>

                        <p>1. Summary: During meeting Feb 2 I raised Cyprus matter with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil, who said <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would not accept fait accompli of Czech
                            arms under <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> control.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had taken very clear decision
                            that if arms were not placed under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            custody, it would “by one means or another” send equal number of arms to
                            Cyprus to restore balance. Caglayangil said <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> fully aware that armed clash on Cyprus might result.
                            Also stated <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would not resume
                            dialogue with Greece until <pb n="533" xml:id="pg_533" facs="0571"/>arms
                            question settled to its satisfaction. (Elekdag and Turkmen also
                            present.)</p>
                        <p>2. Details: I began by explaining that US takes problem of Czech arms
                            very seriously and is concerned lest situation develop to a dangerous
                            point. We are making constant and unremitting efforts at UN, Nicosia and
                            Athens to obtain tightest possible arrangements to guard against
                            distribution of Czech arms and felt we were making some progress. We
                            have never altered our view that all parties including UNSYG should seek
                            to obtain <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody of arms but so far
                            results have been negative. We have therefore concentrated on tightening
                            specifics of UNSYG-<persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            arrangements. Mentioned particularly Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName>'s efforts with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and that Secretary had talked
                            with <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> (without giving
                                substance).<note n="2" xml:id="d253fn2">See <ref target="#d252">Document 252</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName>'s February 3 meeting with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was apparently moved to
                                February 4. Telegram 1109 from Nicosia, February 6, reported that at
                                that meeting <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> told
                                    <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> he intended to
                                begin the distribution of Czech arms on a phased basis beginning in
                                late February. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 27
                                CYP)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In sober tones, Caglayangil said <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                            resolution of March 4, 1964 provides that no one should undertake action
                            which would worsen situation on island. At moment negotiations were
                            started to find peaceful solution to problem, Czechoslovakia permitted
                            arms to be sent to Cyprus. Czechs should not have done this, nor should
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. But there was
                            general belief that all faits accomplis of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> end successfully and other countries believe
                            Turkey must eventually accept them. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> underscored that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            cannot accept fait accompli. Concerning Czech arms, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> decision very clear. If arms were not
                            turned over to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would send equal number of arms to
                            island to restore balance. “We have taken necessary decisions and will
                            implement them.” <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> continued
                            that no one could expect nation of 32 million to accept faits accomplis
                            endlessly. Repeated that if arms not placed under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody, Turkey would send arms by any means possible.
                            This did not necessarily mean Turkey would “intervene” on Cyprus but
                            Turkey would abide by its decision. (This statement not further
                            explained.) Noted that UNSYG was responsible for implementation of
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution. Asked rhetorically why
                            UNSYG had [not?] called Czechs to account for shipping arms. Asked why
                            he did not now insist on US [<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>?]
                            custody. US had made representations to UNSYG and so had Turkey but
                            UNSYG resisted démarches.</p>
                        <p>4. I said Secretary and our Missions at New York and Nicosia were all
                            heavily engaged in tightening up arrangements for control over arms. I
                            thought we were slowly gaining some ground. We would continue to work to
                            prevent distribution of arms for indefinite period, however long that
                            may be. Stressed that US not being half-hearted about this.</p>
                        <pb n="534" xml:id="pg_534" facs="0572"/>
                        <p>5. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> replied that whatever the
                            effectiveness of inspection and control measures, “nothing less than
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody would satisfy Turkey.”
                            Effectiveness of control system would not satisfy Turkey either from
                            point of view of measures taken or from point of view of its prestige.
                            To my question whether this meant Turkey would not be satisfied even if
                            control were completely effective, Turkmen replied (and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> confirmed after returning from
                            phone call) that Turks could not understand how any system could be
                            effective if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> retained
                            custody and warehouse keys.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> remarked that Turk
                            Ambassador at Athens told by Greek Government that it too wanted <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody of arms. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> noted <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> does not have “effective
                            power” on island but <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> has
                            it. Greek Government talks about <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            custody but fails to use influence and pressure on <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to obtain effective control. If
                            UNSYG would insist on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody, this
                            would have effect on <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> attitude and
                            policy. Furthermore, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> convinced
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could respond to
                                <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName>'s pressures, if exerted,
                            without losing face.</p>
                        <p>7. I said our information was that no arms had been generally distributed
                            as yet. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> disagreed saying their
                            information indicated one shipment had been unloaded and was now at
                            Nicosia. This was shipment everyone focussed on controlling. But another
                            shipment believed to have arrived week later and was moved elsewhere on
                            island, and distribution of arms from this shipment had occurred. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> pointed out that in any case it
                            was against nature of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and pattern of his behavior to have arms and not to use them.</p>
                        <p>8. I said we would continue applying pressure on UNSYG and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> on basis that only by means
                            of such continuous efforts would we move them little by little.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> in Greece had
                            also weighed in with new Greek leaders against arms distribution.</p>
                        <p>9. I noted Turk press reports about possible arms airdrop. Said Embassy
                            Nicosia's clear assessment of effect such action was that <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> would react immediately without
                            waiting for Athens' instructions and that results of clash could spread
                            unpredictably. Parenthetically, also noted MinInt Georkadjis admission
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> not informed in advance about
                            arrival of Czech arms.</p>
                        <p>10. Emphatically, Caglayangil said <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            had already accepted that if it dropped arms in Cyprus it would not be
                            an “excursion” but “warfare”. Raising his voice, he said no Greek
                            political party would have courage to accept sacrifice in Greece for
                            Cyprus. But government of technicians could do so. Instead <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is not sincere and fails to hold
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> under its orders.
                            Greek politicians and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            are aggravating situation on island. Hellenic General Staff also
                            government unto itself. In fact, four govts existed in Greece today:
                            army, dynasty, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and opposition.
                            Turkmen noted that several higher ranking Foreign Office members <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0573"/>(Christopoulos, Rendis,
                            Sgourdeos among others) had requested leave at same time in protest
                            against <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>11. I urged continuation Turk-Greek dialogue and Turkmen interjected by
                            asking “who speaks for Greek Govt.” I asked if Turk Ambassador had not
                            seen <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>. Reply was he
                            had not. I said presumably he was point at which all parts of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could be pulled together. Furthermore,
                            I convinced King was seriously and sincerely in favor of constructive
                            dialogue. Turkmen wondered whether fall of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> government was not fait accompli directed
                            against King. Caglayangil commented it had often been said that Turkey
                            had made previous threats about landings on Cyprus. Perhaps people had
                            been lulled into false security because landings did not take place.
                            Turkey did not want to threaten or increase tension but situation was
                            intolerable. If it was question of prestige for GOC and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, it was also question of prestige for
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and Turk Cypriots were in
                            danger.</p>
                        <p>12. To my question as to prospects of resuming dialogue, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> replied firmly “not before arms
                            matter settled. It would be ridiculous.” He asked if it was not
                            ludicrous to talk with Greece about peaceful settlement while <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> plans how to use arms under
                            his custody. Besides, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> added,
                            if Greece cannot use its influence effectively re <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody of arms, how can Greeks be expected convince
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept results
                            of dialogue.</p>
                        <p>13. I replied it was my understanding conditions in Cyprus were quiet at
                            this time. I then stressed utility of dialogue as means of communication
                            between two govts and opportunity for secret talks. I said if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had intended to upset
                            dialogue he would have succeeded if it were not now resumed. Had new
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> expressed willingness resume
                            talks at point where they had been interrupted by fall of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>? Caglayangil twice side-stepped
                            answering this. He wondered with whom <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> could possibly talk and Turkmen observed that Greek
                            Crown Council had not even been able to decide to meet. Both major party
                            leaders had expressed reservations re <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> negotiating powers in dialogue. I said resumption of
                            dialogue would help us all and especially at <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. But Caglayangil repeated that Turkey would not resume
                            dialogue before Czech arms were placed under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> custody and again said would be “ridiculous” for it to
                            do so. I ended by saying US working for peace in Cyprus and I hoped this
                            would be kept in mind.</p>
                        <p>14. As rather an anti-climax and prompting by Turkmen, Caglayangil then
                            mentioned completely unacceptable conditions GOC trying to impose on
                            next Turk troop rotation (March). No conditions whatever would be
                            accepted and rotation would proceed backed by all necessary force. He
                            also referred to Turk-GOC impasse over exit permit for Coskun and asked
                            that US Govt make demarche to GOC to obtain permit. I said I would
                            transmit this request.</p>

                        <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> At no time did <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> mention any deadline within which
                            Czech arms would have to be under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            custody. On Feb 3 <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> and Turkmen
                            both travel to Italy for 3-day visit. Unlikely therefore that Turks
                            would undertake any diplomatic (or military) action before <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> returns. No sign of military
                            crank-up is observable as of now. Nevertheless, Turks clearly losing

                            are convinced only hard line will move things forward. It possible they
                            may plan to run arms in as secretly as possible but will use overt
                            methods if necessary to deliver or in response to further GOC

                        <p>1. Discussions we have had in past few days with persons who participated
                            in Crown Council on Cyprus held Feb 6 have disclosed that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> reassured Council on basis
                            his personal knowledge that US would intervene at appropriate moment as
                            mediator to settle problem, enforce negotiations, and could be counted
                            on to prevent Turks from taking any military action. This disconcerting
                            information comes from several sources, as detailed below.</p>
                        <p>2. I met with ex-<gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> Feb 8 at his request. He
                            said he wishes brief me on Crown Council, which he considered of
                            interest to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. According <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> took strenuous objection to resumption
                            dialogue, which he considers futile endeavor. When <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> asked <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if he could offer alternative
                            to dialogue in view <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537" facs="0575"/>deadlock
                            reached with Cyprus issue, Archbishop replied he had good reason believe
                            US would intervene as mediator at appropriate moment and start
                            negotiations in which US, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus would participate,
                            probably under aegis <gloss target="#t_U1">U</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName> or some other well-known
                            personality. Archbishop was vague and mysterious on this point, but he
                            gave Council impression some American had whispered to him that that
                            would be case. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> stated he
                            did not believe Archbishop was referring to American Ambassador Nicosia
                            or any other senior officer of Embassy Nicosia, but he wondered whether
                            an American possibly of junior rank might not have whispered something
                            to that effect to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in
                            Nicosia. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> asked me if I
                            could confirm this. I replied in negative and assured him position my
                            government had been made very clear to all parties concerned on number
                            of occasions.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> said he pointed out to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> with firmness that
                            Greece's foreign policy could not be based on mere assumptions but on
                            facts only. Archbishop reiterated his belief that US would intervene at
                            appropriate time. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>
                            commented that one good result of Council was that all political leaders
                            present agreed on policy to be followed. Furthermore, after hearing
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> they became
                            convinced he does not want enosis. I asked if it could be taken for
                            granted that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is now
                            fully acquainted with all phases dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> replied that full text synopsis (three pages) of
                            minutes of dialogue, signed by Caglayangil and himself, had been read to
                            Archbishop and that note to this effect had been made in minutes Crown
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> continued that he is
                            worried about maintenance peace in Mediterranean and involvement his
                            country as well as repercussions on Greece's allies. He is not convinced
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> government is
                            in position handle problem effectively. Though he considers
                            Economu-Gouras intelligent and able diplomat, he feels Gouras will be at
                            disadvantage when he meets with his Turkish colleague. He will not be
                            able to speak as equal to equal. With responsible politician at head
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>, situation would be
                            different. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> at this point
                            gave example of how a politician can assume responsibility in critical
                            situation. He said that at time he was discussing Czech arms question
                            with Caglayangil and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> he had not
                            hesitated to send telegram to Greek Amb Nicosia instructing him to
                            return to Athens if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> did
                            not comply with obligations he had accepted in connection Czech arms. It
                            had been only after Alexandrakis had shown this telegram to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that latter realized how
                            serious situation could become if he failed comply with prior
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>5. I told <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> I shared his
                            anxiety, particularly in view fact I have been hearing from Greek
                            friends that they do not doubt <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will
                            intervene in case Turkey should decide attack. I added that from such
                            assumptions, miscalculations and frustration could very well result,
                            precipitating <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0576"/>an extremely
                            serious situation. It would then be impossible to make the Greeks
                            believe that the US had given prior warning that it would not be able
                            play again the role which Greeks apparently expect of it. <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> said he fully agreed.</p>
                        <p>6. <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> elicited following from
                            Progressive Party leader <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName>, who also participated in Council. Principal
                            results Council were: (a) unanimous agreement dialogue should continue;
                            (b) agreement to proposition that enosis can only be achieved if some
                            sort compensation (undetermined) is given Turkey in exchange (although
                            not specifically agreed, consensus was that this compensation could not
                            be territorial); and (c) agreement that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could offer <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            with Turkish participation to be located on an existing British base,
                            presumably Dhekelia. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            apparently pointed out that this would be decision of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> after enosis. According <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName>, debate was dominated largely
                            by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and himself. At one
                            point <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> implied that
                            because of his close relations with certain American sources
                            (unidentified) he is in position know that Turks are bluffing and that
                            the Americans, already preoccupied with Vietnam, would never permit
                            Turks to resort to another military action which would produce crisis in
                            this part of world. <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName>
                            feels that, despite apparent unanimity achieved as result Crown Council,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and perhaps others
                            have already begun undermine situation. Belief exists in some Greek
                            military quarters that the Americans will, in last analysis, prevent any
                            resort to force by Turks.</p>
                        <p>7. Feb 9 I had long meeting with former <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, also a Council
                            participant. He expressed anxiety because <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had come out strongly against resumption
                            dialogue. In effort convince Archbishop Greek political leaders had used
                            argument resumed dialogue would serve only to elucidate certain obscure
                            points in dialogue carried on by previous government. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' view was that talks with
                            Turks are futile since he is determined not to offer anything in
                            exchange for enosis, or for guarantee of continued independence, and
                            therefore continuing dialogue would only cause Turks to believe Greeks
                            and Cypriots are worried and afraid, with result Turks would be even
                            more demanding. In support his negative attitude on dialogue <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> displayed to Council paper in
                            English, which bore no signature but which he alleged he had received
                            from an American source. This paper gave him assurance that if Turks
                            decided launch an attack they would be stopped by us. Under these
                            circumstances <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> took
                            position that situation should be allowed remain more or less as is.
                            Turks are confined to small pockets and are subject severe economic
                            hemorrhage, whereas rest of Cyprus is prospering economically. At this
                            point <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> said he
                            remarked it may well be so with Cyprus, which is receiving considerable
                            aid from Greece and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, but it is not
                            case with Greece. Turning to George Papandreou and Kanellopoulos,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> made point that
                            they, <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0577"/>who both hope govern
                            Greece soon, [garble—must?] think not only of what helping Cyprus is now
                            costing Greece but also of what sacrifices will be required in order
                            fill in gaps in Greek economy. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> also reminded Council that General
                            Tsolakas had said earlier to group that in case Turkish attack immediate
                            defense requirements of country would amount to two hundred million
                            dollars. Turning then to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> remarked that in these circumstances
                            should enosis be achieved a flourishing Cyprus would not receive much
                            benefit from mother country, which would be in poverty. There can be no
                            happiness in Cyprus if there is none in Greece.</p>
                        <p>8. On question Czech arms <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> told Council he did not anticipate violent
                            reaction on part Turks. As evidence he cited call on him by American
                            Ambassador Nicosia three days before arrival of arms via Yugoslavia. He
                            knew their types and numbers. According <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>' account, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> quoted Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> to effect that if arms were not distributed at
                            once and if provocations by Greek Cypriots were avoided, Turks would not
                            react strongly. I expressed strong doubt that any American official
                            could have made such a statement. On contrary, I said, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> efforts have consistently been directed
                            to getting Czech arms under effective <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            supervision. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>
                            continued that at this point in their exchange he reminded Archbishop
                            that his government had first learned of Czech arms from Turks, who in
                            turn may have received information from Americans. In any event, former
                                <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> continued, so far as he
                            concerned Turks had protested very strongly and whole incident had left
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> exposed in eyes international
                            public opinion. Turks were no longer content to threaten merely to
                            supply their compatriots with additional arms but had even asked that
                            Czech arms be reexported from Cyprus. Archbishop responded vaguely that
                            he had probably forgotten to inform <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            about these arms when he had been in Athens in November 1966.</p>
                        <p>9. In face <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' insistence
                            that dialogue not be resumed, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> suggested to King during an interval in
                            Council session (<persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>
                            was present) that it might be well to tell <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> that if he did not agree with Greek political
                            leaders on resumption dialogue it might become necessary alter
                            instructions of Greek forces in Cyprus. King and <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> agreed to this tactic
                            and it was decided <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> would break
                            news to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. All three,
                            however, first sought opinion of Kanellopoulos, who, on hearing
                            proposal, threw up his hands and said, “Never, never, we can never say
                            that to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.” Idea was at
                            once abandoned. It was finally decided <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> would issue statement to press that Crown Council
                            had unanimously decided resume dialogue. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> commented that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had very reluctantly gone
                            along.</p>
                        <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540" facs="0578"/>
                        <p>10. What had come out clearly in Council discussion, <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> said, was that both
                            Panpandreou and Kanellopoulos had committed themselves to accept no
                            solution to Cyprus issue that was not acceptable to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. This left <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> deeply troubled. On this
                            basis, what future could the dialogue have?</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> asked me if
                            paper produced at Council by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could be of American origin. I expressed
                            strongest doubts. I added that I shared his anxiety, for situation as
                            explosive as present one could easily get out of control. Dialogue had
                            virtue that talking is better than doing nothing. I asked if idea of a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base had come up in Crown
                            Council. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> said that
                            whereas this idea had originally been proposed by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, he is now clearly
                            uninterested in this solution.</p>
                        <p>12. <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> said he would be
                            seeing King within 24 hours and asked if he might tell him what, in my
                            opinion, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would do in case Turkish
                            attack. I replied that I doubt that at present anyone can answer that
                            question. We would expect to weigh in with countries concerned in
                            attempt to avert calamity to themselves and Alliance. Matter would also
                            come up immediately in UNSC, which would obviously try to stop fighting.
                            But it is difficult to determine if that could be accomplished in
                            situation where a country has decided to resort to arms in defense its
                            national interests. But it would be risky in extreme to pursue a policy
                            based on assumption US or <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts
                            would be successful. Experience has shown, I continued, how difficult it
                            is for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or anybody else to stop two nations from bringing to a
                            climax an issue which they have failed to solve at less heated levels. I
                            cited India-Pakistan and Israel-Arab states as examples. As for Cyprus,
                            should fighting ever break out a very grave factor which US and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would have to consider would be
                            Soviet reactions. Would Soviet Union limit its responses to propaganda
                            field or act in other ways as well? I hope I conveyed to <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> the impression that we
                            would always be interested and concerned but that Greece could never
                            count on the Sixth Fleet's being at its beck and call if because of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' intransigence it
                            failed to negotiate seriously toward an understanding with Turkey.</p>

                        <p>3805. After intensive review of all considerations that we can evaluate
                            here, I have concurred in [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] recommendation that authority be sought
                            for limited covert political action in connection with forthcoming Greek
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to earlier programs which focused on <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>, purpose would be to restrict dimensions of power base
                            being built by <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>,
                            by encouraging support for certain competitive elements [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. Details of action program will be presented to
                            Department [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>I have come to this recommendation reluctantly. Basically, it is for
                            Greeks who believe their country benefits from close ties with West
                            including United States to generate enough political energy to oppose
                            effectively those who would lead Greece down more dangerous trails. It
                            would be unhealthy for even our best friends here to depend overly long
                            on American crutch. However, at this moment following considerations are
                            to my mind compelling:</p>
                        <p>1. Though forthcoming Greek elections will ostensibly be struggle among
                            pro-Western indigenous nationalist parties, important successes by
                            Andreas could set off policy shifts away from traditional firm alliance
                            with West.</p>
                        <p>To my knowledge younger Papandreou is not under Communist Party
                            discipline. He has adopted and is vigorously promoting many <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> policies, however. Significance is that
                            he gives respectable centrist cover to advancement of Communist
                            policies. Moreover, his public commitment to these policies has become
                            so complete that <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and his personal
                            supporters from left will have effective grip on him should he attain
                            high office after elections. American interests in Greece would be
                            vulnerable to substantial erosion in such an atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>2. These elections come at crucial moment in Andreas' career. They
                            constitute his first major bid for power, at moment when age and
                            weakness of his father open way for succession. If Andreas is set back
                            at this juncture, others with different orientation may improve their
                            chances to take leadership of Center Union. Also, assuming May elections
                            may be inconclusive and followed soon by second elections which (as in
                            1963/64) would strengthen and confirm political trends identified in <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0580"/>May, setbacks in these
                            elections could seriously undermine Andreas' base for takeover effort in
                            second elections. Conversely, successes in May would strengthen Andreas'
                            claim to succeed his father, his position within the party, and
                            prospects of dominating government after second elections.</p>
                        <p>3. Upsurge of Andreas' strength is deepening dichotomy in Greek public
                            life to degree his incipient success might set off rightist
                            counterrevolutionary attempts with prospectively adverse consequences
                            for Greece and for the Alliance. What we don't need in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> now is a Greek military
                            dictatorship.</p>
                        <p>4. Greek political interests opposing Andreas are unquestionably now in a
                            majority but are also in disarray. They seem incapable or at least
                            unprepared for job that should be theirs of cutting Andreas down to
                            size.</p>
                        <p>5. At this moment Communist-directed <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>
                            faces decision whether to seek strengthened Parliamentary position by
                            fielding a full slate or to throw support of its center-left elements to
                            Andreas. From our viewpoint, former course would be preferable even if
                            it brought <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> more Parliamentary seats.
                            Center Union and other parties would then find it essential to oppose
                            Communist-line minority. Should Andreas gain strong position with <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> assistance, however, not only would
                            Communist Party leverage on Andreas be strengthened but Center Union
                            would become more ambivalent between <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>
                            and national parties.</p>
                        <p>6. My recommendation presupposes that United States has interest in
                            maintenance in power of a Greek Government, of whatever party, that is
                            committed to continued close and broad relations with United States, and
                            that Andreas is the most immediate and prospectively potent factor
                            opposing this relationship. [<hi rend="italic">1–1/2 lines of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] U.S. policy needs also to demonstrate
                            sympathetic American support for Greek progress and stability. This has
                            become more difficult at stage when economic assistance has been phased
                            out, military assistance is being phased down more rapidly than either
                            government had foreseen, and unresolved Greek-Turkish differences put
                            strains on Greek-American as well as on Turkish-American relations. Best
                            long-term answer will be found in maintaining variety of active if
                            inexpensive cooperative and contact programs during this transitional
                            period when, rightly or wrongly, Greeks still have not got over sense of
                            dependence on United States developed during past two decades and look
                            to U.S. to push them into doing what they know they should. Suggestions
                            for overt programs being forwarded separately.<note n="2" xml:id="d255fn2">Not found.</note>

                        <p>3819. NATUS Info. From Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. In meeting on USS America February 12 and 13 we have focussed on
                            implications for US policy for Greek-Turkish dialogue and of contingent
                            confrontations over Czech arms and Turkish troop rotation.</p>
                        <p>2. On dialogue, we all believe Greeks and Turks should be pressed to
                            resume talks urgently and to stretch hard for prompt agreement. Present
                            juncture, while full of difficulties, also offers opportunities unlikely
                            soon to recur. It is significant that Greek Crown Council has committed
                            Greek political leaders, at least temporarily, to acceptance of
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>-Caglayangil protocol
                            worked out in Paris in December and also to continuation of dialogue,
                            and that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> for moment
                            also committed to this course, however reluctantly. Stresses of Greek
                            politics including <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            machinations could soon unravel current unified position, resulting
                            possibly in new opposition to dialogue in Greece and in Cyprus and in
                            enhanced prospects of trouble over Czech arms, rotation of troops or
                            other areas. In short, failure to achieve settlement in very near future
                            could make life more difficult for all concerned.</p>
                        <p>3. On parameters of possible settlement, Greek leaks to Embassy Athens
                            suggest that protocol may include considerations of possible
                            arrangements for protection of Turk Cypriots from mistreatment by
                            majority community. Comments <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> has made imply he and Caglayangil may also have
                            laid base for some status of island which would bring it under Greek
                            sovereignty though with certain semi-autonomous fiscal, economic,
                            administrative and political institutions. At any rate, we believe
                            resolution of differences over status of Turk Cypriots and over some
                            sort of commonwealth scheme should be manageable.</p>
                        <p>4. If our sketchy information valid, Paris protocol seems also to point
                            way toward “<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base” as means of
                            giving Turkey some locus standi on island to compensate for island's
                            basic attachment to Greece. If Turkey willing to accept concept of a
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base—whatever that is—in
                            present British sovereign base area of Dhekelia, we believe modalities
                            should be negotiable. They could include continued British sovereignty,
                            transfer of present Greek and Turkish contingents into base area and
                            possible addition of other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            facilities or national units. In this solution, presumably rest of
                            Cyprus would be demilitarized along lines of Dodecanese.</p>
                        <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0582"/>
                        <p>5. Whether Turkey would be prepared to move quickly toward settlement
                            within these parameters is unclear to us. If so, we estimate present
                            Greek Government with support of Palace and acquiescence of major
                            political leaders could negotiate effectively, subject to ratification
                            of any agreement by Crown Council and then by Parliament. If Turkey
                            should stand on insistence that Turkish sovereign base should be
                            established on Cyprus, then we estimate that present Greek Government
                            would have neither authority nor support in Greece or in Cyprus to
                            proceed with negotiations. Effective Greek-Turkish contact would then
                            presumably be broken off at least until after next Greek elections.
                            Since Greek political climate at that time could be less conducive to
                            solutions based on <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> interests (see
                            recent <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>
                            speeches), we would anticipate that arena of action could shift to more
                            direct Turkey-Cyprus confrontations. Indeed, even with progress in
                            dialogue and almost certainly in absence of progress, coming weeks may
                            bring serious Turkey-Cyrpus difficulties.</p>
                        <p>6. Following difficulties, now with us, are assessed as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. Czech arms: Turkey will continue to press <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and others for <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            custody but will probably settle for <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            understanding if GOC position as expressed by <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> is made reasonably tight. However, in event
                            distribution significant number light arms <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would be forced to take some action to answer domestic
                            Turk criticism that it is accepting another <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> fait accompli. It would probably call for
                            session of UNSC to establish that distribution contravenes 4 March 1964
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution. Presumably would get
                            some support. Minor arms infiltration might later be undertaken by
                            Turks. This might not amount to much as it would be operationally
                            difficult but could help to bolster <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s internal position vis-a-vis <gloss target="#t_TGS1">TGS</gloss> and Parliament. Only as later or last resort would
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> attempt arms drop since, as
                            Caglayangil has said, this would mean war on island. (Rationale: <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> aware that issuance of small arms is
                            not sufficient to justify act of war against GOC in eyes world opinion.
                            Having devoted much diplomatic effort over past year to winning friends,
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is therefore likely, if GOC does
                            not push distribution soon or rapidly, to use all diplomatic and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> channels to find redress. If these fail
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will have to take some action
                            for domestic reasons. A graduated series of military steps intended to
                            galvanize favorable action in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> seems
                            most likely. We can only speculate what these steps might be.)</p>
                        <p>B. Rotation: This is potentially most serious problem in immediate
                            future. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has made clear it is not
                            accepting GOC conditions set forth aide-mémoire.<note n="2" xml:id="d256fn2">Transmitted as an attachment to airgram A–137 from
                                Nicosia, February 6. (Ibid.)</note> Furthermore in letter to Turk
                            contingent commander, Chief of Staff has told him if rotation opposed
                            Turkey “will use force.”</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0583"/>
                        <p>If no agreement reached through <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> good offices by March 31 we have assumed unarmed
                            troops on Turk transport would not immediately attempt disembark at
                            Famagusta but rather link up with force which usually alerted by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> in Mersin/Iskenderun area in
                            conjunction periodic rotations. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            would probably then make immediate appeal to UNSC to arrange for
                            rotation as provided by treaty and if this not accomplished, would
                            “shoot her way in.”</p>
                        <p>7. Decision to inject Turkish military into either Czech arms or rotation
                            issue would probably mean some sort of graduated action—demonstration
                            flights, selected target bombings, followed if ultimately necessary by
                            air drop of men and supplies and “full scale” invasion. Air drop would
                            require full scale follow-up since we convinced GOC and <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> would order attack.</p>
                        <p>8. We note that troop rotation scheduled for day before EOKA day
                            observance and four days before Sunay due in Washington. We assume
                            therefore that failure of parties to reach accommodation would create
                            high tensions and that Turkish reaction might be delayed briefly so
                            Sunay could put problem personally to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>9. In order defuse rotation issue believe we should push <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            to find acceptable compromise but should not ourselves as yet get into
                            act directly with either party. However, at some point fairly soon seems
                            advisable approach <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            making clear to him his views on US intervention as expressed Crown
                            Council utterly wrong (and contrary to what Embassy Nicosia has been
                            saying all along). <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> would
                            point out that US [garble] would be warned in time to try prevent start
                            of hostilities even though we would as in past make every effort through
                            diplomatic channels.</p>
                        <p>10. In view above, Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>
                            propose subject to Department's approval to seek opportunities in next
                            few days to explore with leading members of host governments prospects
                            of rapidly resuming dialogue. We would informally encourage them to
                            proceed urgently. Without interjecting ourselves into substance of
                            dialogue, we also propose to touch lightly on such topics as possible
                            commonwealth idea. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> will talk with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and selected Cabinet Ministers re Czech arms
                            and rotation in context of US policy on intervention and at same time
                            will attempt impress upon them fact that present is new opportunity to
                            make progress toward solution.</p>

                        <p>3874. Cyprus. NATUS Info. A good deal of familiar ground was covered in
                            seven hour discussion of Cyprus today with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>.</p>
                        <p>He also opened up some new terrain, however, particularly on resumption
                            of dialogue and on base question.</p>
                        <p>When Prime Minister said he ready resume dialogue immediately and
                            couldn't understand why Turks delaying, I replied we believe major
                            misunderstanding must have developed between Greeks and Turks.</p>
                        <p>It is our impression Turks consider they have not received <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> assurances of willingness to resume
                            dialogue at point where interrupted by fall of <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> government. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> replied flatly that he
                            had told <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and had announced to Greek
                            Parliament his willingness to do just that. I asked if this meant <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> prepared to talk on basis of full faith
                            and credence in <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>-Caglayangil discussions. He replied that since no
                            agreement had been reached it was a question of continuing from point at
                            which it had broken off and that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is
                            ready and eager to pick up dialogue even today from point at which it
                            was interrupted in December. He reminded me that <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> and Caglayangil had agreed to
                            meet again soon. That is exactly what his government wishes to do.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> showed some
                            reluctance to resume dialogue with Turkish Ambassador Athens<note n="2" xml:id="d257fn2">In telegram 3869, February 17, <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> reported on Tuluy's
                                perplexity about Greek intentions. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> stated that he had assured Tuluy that, based
                                on talks with <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>,
                                Greece wanted to continue the dialogue. (Ibid.)</note> (or,
                            presumably, Greek Ambassador Ankara). He suggested Bonn as site where
                            Greek and Turkish Ambassadors are both able men and enjoy good
                            relations. He would be ready to instruct his Ambassador to Bonn
                            immediately, he said, if this agreeable to Turks.</p>
                        <p>After suggesting that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would want to
                            clear up apparent misunderstanding with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> I asked if it would be helpful for me to inform my
                            colleague in Ankara of <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> government's position on resuming
                            dialogue so that if appropriate Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> might advise <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> of
                            our understanding of Greek position. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> immediately agreed, and asked our help in getting
                            Turks to respond quickly.</p>
                        <p>These comments were made in context of exchange between us on value and
                            importance of reactivating dialogue promptly. <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>
                            <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0585"/>asserted that his government is
                            well positioned for serious discussions with Turks since Crown Council
                            has given it all-party mandate to proceed.</p>
                        <p>On substance of dialogue, <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> said that at point <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> dropped out Turkey had proposed
                            to Greece that a Turkish military base be established on Cyprus as quid
                            pro quo for enosis. (I did not understand clearly, nor perhaps does
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>, whether Turks
                            had actually agreed that a base would compensate them for straight
                            enosis, or for something less jarring to their ears, such as
                            Greek-Cyprus federation or commonwealth, or whether enosis bridge had
                            not been crossed.) Turks had not indicated extent or nature of base, but
                            were awaiting Greek reply on acceptability of concept. Obviously, Prime
                            Minister said, reply could only be given when dialogue reactivated.</p>
                        <p>After lengthy review of dangers embedded in Cyprus issue,
                            Para-skevopoulos then made pitch United States support of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base idea. He argued that a Turkish
                            military base could guarantee only permanency of tensions that have
                            already so gravely damaged life on island. In contrast, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base with Turkish presence along with
                            Greek, British, American and possibly other national components would
                            give all possible protection to security of southern Turkey. It would
                            also help normalize living conditions in rest of island. Prime Minister
                            expressed hope that logic of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base
                            would commend itself to Turks. He also expressed certainty that with
                            settlement of base issue other problems such as guarantees for minority
                            community on island could be solved. If base question left unresolved,
                            he said, explosive potentials on island could damage not only Greek and
                            Turk interests but those of Western Alliance since Soviets obviously
                            eager to turn Cyprus into Mediterranean Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I responded that we have indeed [been] long aware of explosive
                            possibilities both on island and between Greece and Turkey. As Prime
                            Minister knows, United States is not supporting any particular plan for
                            solution of Cyprus issue. We believe parties must reach solution by
                            agreement, and I could say confidently that U.S. would support any
                            agreed solution. We have supported dialogue so strongly, I said, because
                            only hope lies in their direct and common search for accommodation with
                            which each can live. Moreover, as demonstrated more than once during
                                <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> period, commitment to
                            dialogue of high officials in Athens and Ankara enables them to
                            communicate directly when dangers emerge on such related subjects as
                            might arise this spring over Czech arms, fortification programs, or the
                            next Turkish rotation. Commenting that some people seem to believe
                            Eastern Mediterranean could live without solving this problem because at
                            last moment United States would somehow prevent explosions, I said that
                            situation obviously not that simplistic. Indeed, I was under
                            instructions to remind Prime Minister <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0586"/>that United States had made no undertaking to intervene
                            and that it would be quite dangerous to make any assumption regarding
                            future U.S. position in this regard. He said he understood.</p>
                        <p>Describing Crown Council meeting to me, Prime Minister said Greek
                            political leaders had started out in considerable disagreement. After
                            eight hours of hard discussion, they had come to virtually full
                            agreement. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> strongly
                            opposed political leaders' views, but came around after two more hours
                            so Prime Minister could accurately announce unanimity of views. He took
                            obvious pride in noting that unanimity had been achieved this time even
                            though it has been quite rare not only in course of Cyprus issue but in
                            Greek political history generally. I commented that this another reason
                            to proceed with all speed toward agreement with Turkey, lest unusual
                            unanimity of support for his course be eroded with passage of time. He
                            heartily concurred, and again asked that we help to get the Turks
                            agreement to immediate resumption of dialogue.</p>

                        <p>With each high-level conversation here I am becoming more convinced that
                            Greece is preparing to call upon U.S. to persuade Turkey to accept
                            formula consisting basically of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>

                            international practices as compensation for substance of enosis. In any
                            case, I avoided probing further on content of understanding between
                            Greece and Turkey in order not to encourage request for further U.S.

                                with a Turkish contingent attached to it. (Ibid., DEF 15 CYP)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Prior to suspension in December Greek-Turkish dialogue on Cyprus
                            included consideration of base on Cyprus as compensation to Turkey for
                            enosis. Reftel explored possibility of a “<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base” on Cyprus in very general terms as part of a
                            Cyprus solution. Responses at that time indicated that:</p>
                        <p>a. While a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> peacekeeping force on
                            Cyprus was not considered advisable, a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> presence such as a headquarters, command, airfield,
                            port or support base (possibly for <gloss target="#t_AMF1">AMF</gloss>)
                            might provide a Turkish and/or multinational military presence on the
                            Island that could satisfy the Turks in the interests of reaching a
                            solution to the problem.</p>
                        <p>b. The major problems to overcome are the possible opposition of
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, the Turkish stand
                            against enosis and the requirement for guarantee of the rights of
                            Turkish Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>c. The Turks (according to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>) might be willing to accept enosis provided the
                            right formula could be found. This formula must include Turkish troops
                            on the Island under a Turkish-dominated joint or <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base at Dhekelia and guarantee of
                            Turkish Cypriot rights by the UN.</p>
                        <p>d. Other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations might go along
                            with such an idea if it becomes a critical factor in a solution.
                            Subsequently, the situation has been altered: (1) Recently the Greek
                            Crown Council (including <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>) agreed to accept <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base concept after enosis, and (2) the problems of
                            troop rotations, fortifications, and Czech arms have increased tensions.
                            In order to provide some ideas for further consideration, a closer look
                            at the possibility of utilizing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> in
                            a Cyprus solution appears necessary, even though we have no assurance
                            this will satisfy the Turks who were “offered more” during 1964 Acheson
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>2. General concepts in para 3 below might be developed in an attempt to
                            accommodate Turkish-Greek requirements. Their consideration <pb n="550" xml:id="pg_550" facs="0588"/>along with response to questions in
                            para 4 is requested. These ideas are entirely exploratory, are aimed at
                            providing plausible <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> role for
                            continued presence of Turkish forces on Cyprus, and represent an
                            expansion of the ideas contained reftel. The US would not initiate or
                            advocate them but would propose them discreetly to the Greeks and/or
                            Turks for their use or sponsorship if <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base idea proves feasible. They do not represent a US
                            position. These concepts presuppose enosis, adequate guarantees of the
                            rights of Turkish Cypriots, demilitarization of the Island less the SBA
                            bases and the retention of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> presence
                            on Cyprus as observers. Additionally, all parties involved must accept
                            and have valid assurance of fulfillment of all conditions in advance of
                            execution.</p>
                        <p>3. The following are listed as possible concepts for utilizing <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces on Cyprus at the Dhekelia
                            Base:</p>
                        <p>a. A Greek-Turkish joint command with the possible addition of <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces as an extension of <gloss target="#t_LANDSOUTHEAST1">LANDSOUTHEAST</gloss> with a mission of
                            planning and training ground forces. The forces assigned would be from
                            those now on Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>b. A headquarters and/or exercise base for units of the <gloss target="#t_AMF1">AMF</gloss> or other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> force. The same Greek, Turkish and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces as in 3a, above, would be based at
                            Dhekelia as a permanent nucleus force with the addition of limited
                            numbers or representatives of nations providing forces to the <gloss target="#t_AMF1">AMF</gloss> as a part of the staff.</p>
                        <p>4. The questions listed are issues that should be considered and answered
                            in connection with the above concepts:</p>
                        <p>a. What is the probable reaction of host nations to these ideas at this
                            time?</p>
                        <p>b. Should sovereignty of Dhekelia be retained by <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>c. Who should the commander and vice commander of such a force be and
                            should these positions be rotated among the nations involved?</p>
                        <p>d. Should there be an honorary base commanding officer (Turkish) in
                            addition to the force commander to enlarge the number of prestige
                            positions?</p>
                        <p>e. Should the size of the Greek, Turkish and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> forces be limited in size to possibly a battalion
                            each?</p>
                        <p>f. Should the Greeks and Turks contribute to the cost of such a concept
                            particularly in view each spends over $10 million annually on
                            Cyprus?</p>
                        <p>g. Should other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nations contribute
                            towards financing, and to what degree?</p>
                        <p>h. Would participation by the Turks, by having a military force on Cyprus
                            and a degree of command, satisfy their requirements?</p>
                        <p>6. Your comments on these ideas and questions are requested by March 10.
                            This material should be closely held. <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> base concept <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0589"/>should not be discussed with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>

                        <p>a. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> indicated they had
                            definite reservations but were anxious to hear the arguments. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> had earlier registered
                            reservations.</p>

                            major arguments for a U.S. role in the elections were contained in
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>'s cable (Athens
                            3805) dated 11 February 1967.<note n="2" xml:id="d259fn2">

                            whereas the U.S. participation could not guarantee the winner it
                            certainly would have an impact. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> had been observed for a sufficient
                            period to realistically place him in a camp definitely hostile to U.S.
                            interests. <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> was
                            driving very hard while other candidates were, at best, lethargic.</p>
                        <p>d. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> wondered if we
                            weren't approaching this type of 1967 election on a momentum started in
                            the fifties. We had assets, techniques and money, and we could perform
                            almost by rote. Was the threat that great? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> felt that the papers had not
                            made the election issues entirely clear. Was it not possible that we
                            were attributing more potential to Andreas than he deserved?</p>

                            called to a meeting with the Secretaries of State and Defense, and it

                            Spandidakis stated that within the past ten days various key officers
                            have been on unofficial alert status, the first step in implementing
                            “Ierax (Hawk) Number Two.” Spandidakis also said that since 15 February,
                            30 to 35 trusted middle-grade officers have been transferred to the
                            Athens Military Command. Major General (Retired) Petros Mitsakos stated

                            and their specific duties in connection with it.</p>
                        <p>2. Spandidakis stated on 6 March 1967 that within the past ten days
                            various key officers have been on unofficial alert status, the first
                            step in implementing “Ierax (Hawk) Number Two”. (Field comment:
                            According to Spandidakis, “Ierax Number Two” is a plan for the military
                            take-over of Greece contingent upon the occurrence of another political
                            crisis. In the event such a crisis occurs, the plan outlines the role of
                            key military units which would be involved in the take-over. See [<hi rend="italic">doucment number not declassified</hi>]

                            for additional details on this contingency plan). This unofficial alert
                            status involves maintaining daily contact with Spandidakis and a “fairly
                            high state of readiness for action in the units involved.” Spandidakis
                            stated that the above is due to Palace uneasiness over the present
                            situation. Key officers on unofficial alert status are <gloss target="#t_GAGS1">GAGS</gloss> G–2 Brigadier General Pavourgias

                            Command. Kotinis was in this category.</p>
                        <p>4. Mitsakos stated on 7 March that Antonakos, acting under the orders of

                            members asking [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not

                            Greek elections. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, still
                            unable to attend, advised by telephone that he was opposed to the
                            proposal unless there was an overwhelming conviction on the part of the
                            other principals that the United States must participate.</p>
                        <p>b. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] the strong appeal of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> to discontented youth. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            there was a heavy trend toward urbanization of the youth drifting away
                            from rural areas.</p>
                        <p>c. When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> suggested that
                            there were other examples of leftists settling down after an election,
                            he mentioned Betancourt in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>d. [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] one of the principal factors making <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> a distinct threat was
                            his percolating animosity to the United States which was unlikely to
                            change. [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            if it looked likely that Andreas was moving closer to victory, the
                            monarchy and the military could well suspend the constitution and take
                            over. The military was estimated as being loyal to the king.</p>
                        <p>e. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> stated that
                            there were divided counsels in State and that he should talk to the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>f. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> summed up both sides
                            of the case: the well stated recommendation of the country team versus
                            the risks of disclosure at a ticklish time and the consequences of not
                            participating at this time.</p>
                        <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0593"/>
                        <p>g. [<hi rend="italic">4–1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>h. The principals decided that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> would take the matter up with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and if the latter felt the
                            proposal was vital, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName>
                            would discuss the matter with higher authority.</p>
                        <p>i. On 14 March, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName>
                            reported by memorandum that he had discussed the project with the
                            Secretary and that “He comes down negative. In the Greek case, he
                            believes the possible political gain is outweighed by the security
                            risks. He commented that if the dual-national Greek-Americans are
                            concerned about the prospects and if $200–$300,000 will make the
                            difference, they should have no trouble raising that sum themselves
                            without involving the United States Government.”</p>

                        <p>We called on EK leader George Papandreou today at his Kastri home and
                            found him mentally alert and in seemingly good health.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou began by apologizing for his son's, Andreas, recent speech
                            before the Foreign Press Association (A–463 of March 7).<note n="2" xml:id="d262fn2"> Brackets in the source text.</note> Unfortunately,
                            he said, “Andreas tries to be a Kennedy and a Fulbright” in the wrong
                            setting. Papandreou called our attention to his brief statement after
                            Andreas' speech in which he repeated that the foreign policy of the EK
                            remains unchanged. He added that, specfically, he does not share <pb n="556" xml:id="pg_556" facs="0594"/>Andreas' view concerning
                            American interference in the internal affairs of Greece. In the past,
                            particularly during the period of the late Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PJH1">Peurifoy</persName>, there was open intervention
                            by the U.S., but in recent times, especially since the arrival of
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>, there has been
                            no such interference. (Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHR1">Labouisse</persName> once mentioned to him that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> in Greece was not completely under his
                            control). The EK leader added that he intended, during a UPI press
                            interview this Sunday, to deny the existence of any U.S. intervention in
                            the recent past. [Q: “Were there interventions by U.S. in the internal
                            policy of Greece? A: Unfortunately there was—in the past. And in such an
                            unprovoked way that they caused the disappointment of our People. During
                            the last period however, as far as I know at least, the United States
                            Embassy made no intervention. And it never encouraged deviation”.]<note n="3" xml:id="d262fn3">Not printed. (Ibid., POL 6 GREECE)</note>
                            (This quotation appeared in the UPI interview published March 19.)</p>
                        <p>Turning to the current political situation, Papandreou candidly admitted
                            that he knew beforehand of the plan to topple the <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> Government and to form
                            the present transitional government. In fact, <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> as Prime Minister was his choice.
                            Papandreou also admitted that he had promised the King not only to
                            support <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> but also
                            to back the simple proportional electoral system. Even though this
                            system is contrary to the interests of the EK and is opposed by many EK
                            deputies, he agreed to vote for it to promote the return of political
                            “normality”.</p>
                        <p>He predicted that all EK deputies will vote for it out of respect for him
                            as leader of the party. He also commented that <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> leader Kanellopoulos had acted as a real statesman
                            during the past several months.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou expressed grave concern over the current activities of the
                            “junta”. In response to the Ambassador's question, he named <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>, Pipinellis, and (retired)
                            General <persName corresp="#p_DLGK1">Dovas</persName> as members of the
                            junta. It also includes other retired generals and deputies who fear
                            elections. The “president” of the junta, Papandreou added, is probably
                            Queen <persName corresp="#p_FH1">Frederika</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The EK leader expressed fear that the junta might try to upset the plan
                            for elections and to create the conditions for a dictatorship by
                            arresting Andreas for the Aspida affair just as soon as Parliament is
                            dissolved and he no longer is protected by his immunity as a deputy. If
                            he were arrested, Papandreou continued, there would be no elections.
                            There would surely be demonstrations and protests, and Andreas would
                            become “a hero and a martyr”. In fact, the elder Papandreou added,
                            Andreas would like nothing better than to be arrested.</p>
                        <p>The best way to avoid this danger and to ensure the holding of elections
                            would be the granting of an amnesty for the Aspida affair. This is <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0595"/>exactly what he told <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>, the King's political advisor,
                            during a conversation at Kastri yesterday. He also said to <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> that the EK could not publicly
                            ask for an amnesty because “we are the accused”; the King, however,
                            should take the “initiative” in granting it. Papandreou admitted to
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> that some EK
                            politicians and deputies would point to an amnesty by the King as proof
                            that the Palace was guilty on July 15, 1965, and that Aspida was merely
                            a conspiracy against the EK. Though he could not prevent the press from
                            expressing its views, Papandreou stated that he would publicly say that
                            the granting of an amnesty was an act to promote political normality and
                            that he would use his influence to try to persuade the EK papers to
                            follow the same line.</p>
                        <p> Papandreou also warned <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>
                            that a dictatorship would be a disaster not only for Greece but also for
                            the monarchy. King Constantine would soon find that he was no longer
                            master of the situation and that, on the contrary, he was a captive of
                            the dictator, just as the King became a captive of John Metaxas in the
                            1930's.</p>
                        <p>According to Papandreou, the King should take a long-range view of
                            developments and should be less concerned over the words of Andreas. He
                            should realize that “it is deeds, not words that count”. Papandreou
                            asserted that, despite Andreas' line, he, George Papandreou, is the
                            leader of the party. Evidence of this was the vote for the <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> Government when Andreas
                            disagreed, but eventually accepted the decision of his father to support
                            the new government. In a revealing remark, the elder Papandreou told us
                            that he would have expelled Andreas from the party for his general
                            behavior if Andreas were not his son.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the King, Papandreou argued that the young monarch should
                            not be worried about the elections because he was given assurances that
                            there would be no “popular front” between <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and the EK and that he would not raise a regime
                            question. (Papandreou commented that he strongly believes that the
                            institution of the monarchy is necessary in Greece.) Even if Andreas
                            should break away from the EK and take 30, 40, or even 50 deputies with
                            him and cooperate with 20 or 30 <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>
                            deputies, he would still only have less than a third of Parliament and
                            he would not be able to change Greece's foreign policy. Therefore,
                            according to the EK leader, the King should not be so worried over
                            Andreas' attacks.</p>
                        <p>Finally, referring once more to the junta, Papandreou expressed the hope
                            that the Ambassador would use his influence in favor of an amnesty for
                            Aspida. Papandreou obviously had in mind the Ambassador's speaking to
                            the King.</p>

                            issue for which they have primary responsibility, while <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, GOC and eventually Turkish

                        <p>4335. NATUS.</p>
                        <p>1. During past few days there has been flurry of rumors in press and
                            elsewhere regarding fall of <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> government and postponement of
                            elections. These stories have now been partly discredited, however, by
                            (A) statements of both George Papandreou and Kanellopoulos reaffirming
                            their support of <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>
                            and reexpressing their belief in need for return of political normality
                            through elections in May; (B) Parliament's approval in principle of
                            simple proportional electoral bill; and (C) statement by government day
                            before yesterday saying it “is certain of its stability which is
                            guaranteed by confidence of two large parties supporting it”. Most
                            leading personalities now seem either to want early elections or to be
                            reluctantly reconciled to seeing them held.</p>
                        <p>2. There is still, however, an active rightist group which is reportedly
                            seeking to upset <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName>
                            and to postpone elections through formation of government, even if this
                            government could not obtain vote of confidence in Parliament. Reports
                            vary, but persons usually mentioned as favoring this extreme course are:
                            former <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Pipinellis, Electheros Kosmos
                            publisher <persName corresp="#p_KS1">Kostantopoulos</persName>, former
                            DefMin <persName corresp="#p_GP1">Garoufalias</persName>, former Public
                            Security Minister Apostolakos, former <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> Deputy Farmakis and Queen Mother Frederika who,
                            according to George Papandreou, is leader of “junta”. There have been
                            conflicting reports whether Major <persName corresp="#p_AMM1">Arnaoutis</persName>, King's private secretary, is also an adherent
                            of this group. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> has also reported
                            that Lt. General Spandidakis, Chief of Greek Army General Staff, has
                            recently acted to prepare for implementation of Ierax (Hawk) 2, an
                            alleged plan for military control of Greece contingent upon occurrence
                            of another political crisis.</p>
                        <p>3. In our view, a plan probably does exist for certain actions by
                            military in event of a dictatorship, but there is no evidence that army
                            leadership is actually plotting to create conditions leading to
                            deviation from Constitution. On contrary, we hold to opinion that
                            military would not seek independently to impose a dictatorship: but it
                            would support a dictatorship if King decided in favor of such a regime.
                            (Also see USDOA message 0345 March 67.)<note n="2" xml:id="d264fn2">Not

                        </p>
                        <p>4. Though it is not clear how well integrated civilian side of “junta” is
                            or how determined it is to upset path to elections, its members all seem
                                <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0599"/>to be united, however, by
                            fear that elections in May, particularly under <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> government, would result
                            in EK's obtaining at least plurality of votes and in <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>'s being the dominant
                            voice in new government. There are several ways by which they could try
                            to topple present government and create situation leading to
                            postponement of elections. One, they could create some incident, e.g.
                            arrest of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>
                            following dissolution of Parliament, that might produce all kinds of
                            pyrotechnics providing pretext for postponing elections. Similar result
                            might be achieved if government acted flagrantly in favor of ERE during
                            electoral campaign, e.g. actions by gendarmerie and TEA (Home Guard)
                            forces. Another possibility would be to try to persuade <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> himself to resign on
                            pretext his government was under irreconcilable ERE and EK pressures on
                            how it should behave during campaign.</p>
                        <p>5. In certain quarters, Progressive Party leader <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> has been mentioned as likely
                            choice for mandate if government fell. Theory would be for <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> to appear in Parliament for
                            vote of confidence for specified period, perhaps six months, to conclude
                            Aspida affair, seek settlement of Cyprus problem, make certain reforms
                            in economic field, etc. Supporters of <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> believe he could obtain vote of confidence,
                            even though he does not enjoy wide popularity, because Deputies would
                            realize choice was either <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> or dictatorial regime. <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> might be able to gain support
                            of EK or part of it for a short postponement of elections, if he could
                            assure George Papandreou that an amnesty of Aspida affair would be
                            forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>6. Key and still uncertain element in current picture, however, is
                            attitude of King. We know that King was initially pleased by smooth
                            transition from <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> and by
                            prospect of extricating himself, through elections, from vulnerable
                            position in which he found himself after July 1965. Recently, however,
                            the King has reportedly been dismayed by George Papandreou's failure to
                            control his son and King has begun to have second thoughts on wisdom of
                            holding elections in May and of permitting EK, and, particularly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> to emerge
                            as leading political force. King has undoubtedly been under strong
                            pressure from rightists, including possibly his mother, to alter his
                            stand towards present transitional government and elections. On other
                            hand, he has also been warned by George Papandreou, through Palace
                            political advisor, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>, that
                            any deviation from Constitution could be catastrophic both for country
                            and for monarchy (A–491).<note n="3" xml:id="d264fn3">See <ref target="#d262fn1">footnote 1, Document 262</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>7. In our view, any effort by Palace and by Right to postpone elections
                            could play right into hands of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> and Left, unless it were carefully engineered
                            to avoid appearance of direct <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0600"/>involvement by King. This, however, would be extremely difficult to
                            accomplish. Even more dangerous would be establishment of a
                            dictatorship—a view that we have expressed to many Greek personalities,
                            including King, over past several months. On balance, we are inclined to
                            believe that our assessment of political situation as reflected in
                                A–432<note n="4" xml:id="d264fn4">Dated February 11. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 2 GREECE)</note> is still essentially
                            valid and that King, despite pressures by Right, wishes to avoid
                            extremism. <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> and DATT concur in this

                        <p>Dear Dan:</p>
                        <p>As the attached memo of conversation shows,<note n="2" xml:id="d265fn2">Not found.</note> the King last night confirmed our suspicion that
                            Greece is entering a new political stage. He represented himself as
                            deadly serious in concluding that he cannot afford to risk the
                            destruction of free Greece by permitting <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> to come to power. From that
                            conclusion, if he should hold to it, there naturally would flow
                            decisions ranging on the extreme. At least for now the King's thinking
                            has been narrowed to the question of whether he can stop Andreas by
                            constitutional (or relatively constitutional) means or will be forced
                            outside the Constitution into an extra-parliamentary government.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps optimistically, I do not regard the dialogue on his major premise
                            as yet closed. Last night, with the <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> Government apparently falling round his
                            head and with the near future even murkier than it had looked 24 hours
                            earlier, the King seemed little interested in any general discussion of
                            the proposition. Indeed, it is hard for us to <pb n="563" xml:id="pg_563" facs="0601"/>argue that Greece under the Andreas
                            that has emerged in the past year would be either a liberal democracy or
                            firmly oriented toward the West. The signs increasingly point in another
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>You will note that I raised enough questions to keep the door open for a
                            later presentation of views of American Andreas-watchers. We in the
                            Embassy will, and perhaps you in Washington can, get to work immediately
                            on a commentary on the King's major premise.</p>
                        <p>On his minor premise, i.e., that, however reluctantly, he might need to
                            move to an extra-parliamentary government, I used a similar approach. My
                            questions in this area were directed only toward pragmatic aspects: what
                            kind and strength of opposition would be generated and how repressive
                            would such a regime have to become? You'll recall that in earlier talks
                            I had emphasized to the King our generally repugnant attitude toward
                            dictatorships, citing our foot-dragging in recognizing the new Argentine
                            regime. He is sufficiently aware of the general American posture so that
                            I saw little point in going over the same ground last evening.</p>
                        <p>What we need to do now is to prepare a response which can be presented to
                            the King as the view of the United States Government. I am sure that,
                            like us, you will ponder seriously the King's request for assurance of
                            United States support of moves he may feel forced to take. Nor will it
                            be easy to frame a reply, since our record in dealing with
                            extra-parliamentary regimes covers the broadest possible spectrum of
                            cases, ranging from the Communist coups d'etat of the 1940's through
                            Pakistan in 1958 and Turkey in 1960 to the rash of authoritarian
                            takeovers spreading across Africa in the 1960's—not to mention Latin
                            America. We shall of course work urgently on a draft for consideration
                            by Washington. Naturally, the essential decisions must be made at your
                            end.</p>
                        <p>As to the question of persuading George Papandreou to give Andreas a
                            one-way ticket out of Greece, it is such a gloriously simple idea that I
                            could wish it were not wholly impractical. If you have any thoughts that
                            would moderate our sense that we can't do anything about this one,
                            please do let me know right away.</p>
                        <p>A word about timing: in this fast-breaking situation crucial decisions
                            could be made almost any night in the next dozen. As of this moment
                            (when we don't yet know the outcome of the EK–<gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> confrontation over immunities), however, it still seems
                            more likely that the King will try to stick to the parliamentary track
                            as long as he can until he is finally persuaded that if elections are
                            held the Andreas forces are headed for an EK majority. Today I don't
                            know whether the critical moment will come in mid-May or a further
                            interim period will carry Greece through the summer and into the
                            autumn.</p>
                        <p>In any case, until the signals become clearer I believe the King's
                            request must be treated with the utmost urgency. Unless we learn over
                                <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0602"/>the weekend that a more
                            extended time-frame will be available to us, I would hope that you can
                            get instructions to me early in the coming week. Knowing what a demand
                            this puts upon you, I pondered sending all this by telegram. Since pouch
                            delivery should be very prompt, however, I concluded you would be in a
                            better position to proceed by having the whole story at once.</p>
                        <p>As I say to my colleagues here: Well, chaps, we're in it now!</p>
                        <p>With best wishes,</p>

                            military devices would do most to strengthen <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Equality among member nations was one need.</p>
                        <p>Turkey's position at this juncture was critical. Turks “appreciated and
                            respected” United States commitments to Turkey, but the entire
                            Southeastern flank would collapse if Turkey could not hold out until
                            help arrived. Turkey's forces were being kept strong. Soviet aims and
                            aspirations remained unchanged. If <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            collapsed, countries bordering the Soviet Union could not resist.</p>
                        <p>Lately some East European countries had begun to pursue their separate
                            national interests. In the atmosphere of détente, Turkish relations with
                            Romania, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union had begun to improve, but Turkey
                            had no illusions. The basic guiding principle in Turkish foreign policy
                            remained “fulfillment of commitments to allies.”</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">The Middle East</hi>—Conflicts among the Arabs were
                            matters of concern. The Arab-Israeli question remained unsolved, and now
                            there was the question of Aden. As a result of the Soviet factor, this
                            situation was becoming more delicate.</p>
                        <p>North Africa was not a bright spot. In December, Bourguiba had told him
                            that Tunisia sought United States assistance in view of Soviet military
                            assistance to Algeria and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>India-Pakistan disputes produced many difficulties. Pakistan was very
                            disappointed not to have American aid. The Pakistanis had right on their
                            side in the Kashmir dispute; they should be helped to settle it, to
                            prevent their turning to Red China. India would then be able to extend
                            Western influence to Burma and elslewhere. If Iran could strengthen its
                            armed forces, peace and security in that area would prevail.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Cyprus</hi>—Good Greek-Turkish relations, within the
                            alliance to which both belonged, were vital for regional security. The
                            Cyprus question must be settled peacefully before these relations are
                            damaged further. The Turks had been patient, but Greece still wanted to
                            annex the island. Cyprus was now a question of national pride in Greece.
                            In Sunay's view, solution would only be possible through mutual
                            concessions. The gap between the communities on the island was deep; it
                            would be difficult for them to co-exist peacefully. He suggested (a) in
                            Turkish majority areas, Turks should be granted municipal autonomy, (b)
                            Cyprus should be demilitarized, and (c) Turkish troops should be
                            permitted to stay there as a guarantee of Turkish interests.</p>
                        <p>The Turks had recognized sincerity and understanding on the Greek side
                            during the recent dialogue, but no agreement had been reached. The <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0604"/>Greeks could only talk about
                            annexation. The Greeks maintained that independence meant increasing
                            Communist influence and decreasing mainland influence.</p>
                        <p>In the Turkish view, these arguments did not justify enosis. Greek forces
                            have de facto control on the island today, but a solution to the problem
                            should be possible with the help of the allies. He suggested a
                            Turkish-Greek condominium putting an end to Cypriot independence.</p>
                        <p>Sunay reflected concern about political instability in Greece and urged
                            that Czech arms on the island be at the “disposal” of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He implied that Turkey would be willing
                            to resume the dialogue with the Greeks when the Greek political
                            situation permitted. The sufferings of the Turkish community on the
                            island were a result of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' “Byzantine tactics.” <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> must be made to see reason.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps the U.S. could help bring this about. “Turkey expects the utmost
                            help from the United States.”</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">U.S.-Turkish Relations</hi>—There was real identity of
                            interests and policies between the two countries. Their fortunes were
                            inseparable. Turks would never forget 1947 and the Truman Doctrine.
                            Sentiment had entered the equation, and had been an emotional shock to
                            the Turks when the U.S. disappointed them on the Cyprus issue. Turkey
                            had rushed to help in Korea, and had expected the U.S. to reciprocate.
                            Our “intervention” had provoked strong criticism and charges that
                            Turkey's foreign policy had produced a loss of freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>The present Turkish regime wished to eliminate these wrong views. The
                            enemies of our friendship were merely a noisy minority. We hoped his
                            visit would aid in producing a consensus in support of Turkish-American
                            cooperation.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">Viet-Nam</hi>—President Sunay recognized the wisdom of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s efforts in
                            Viet-Nam for the preservation of world peace. Our policy was similar to
                            our Eastern European policy of 1947. Sunay thought there could be no
                            purely military solution to the problem. Under these circumstances, the
                            Turks followed closely our efforts toward a peaceful settlement.</p>
                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>'s Response</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> thanked
                            President Sunay for an enjoyable and constructive presentation. He hoped
                            that when the Viet-Nam conflict is finally settled, people will think we
                            did the right thing as they now think we did the right thing in 1947 by
                            aiding Turkey under the Truman Doctrine. Fighting aggression anywhere is
                            costly in dollars and lives, but worth it.</p>
                        <p>He was aware of strong Turkish feelings about Cyprus and mentioned the
                            United States initiative to avert a Turkish invasion, to which the Turks
                            had reacted. We were in full sympathy with the Turkish community <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0605"/>in Cyprus and would help to see
                            their security guaranteed. He was encouraged by Sunay's stress on the
                            need for a peaceful solution. Just as he regretted that peace in
                            Viet-Nam was so elusive, he regretted that no Cyprus solution had been
                            found.</p>
                        <p>The President noted that the topics discussed by Sunay would be discussed
                            one by one between Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and

                            American people's attitudes toward Turkey. While there might be some
                            anti-American feelings in Turkey, there are strong pro-Turkish feelings

                            should be more carefully weighed by King. Andreas as “martyr” with

                            You should stress point that U.S. reaction to <pb n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0606"/>such move cannot be determined in

                            Parliament to Kanellopoulos is most important move young King has made
                            since he ascended to throne three years ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d268fn2">The King asked Kanellopoulos on April 3 to form a government to
                                take the country through elections. In telegram 4569 from Athens,
                                April 7, <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> reported that
                                he had pressed the new Prime Minister for an indication of what

                                elections. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> noted that
                                his “prodding” led Kanellopoulos to declare that “the Greek nation
                                would never be delivered to the communists or to <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>. It would be

                            worst. Admittedly, King's choices were limited once he had decided that
                            he could not risk a Center Union majority victory in the elections and

                            Palace to bring it down. <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> press and
                            Kanellopoulos have argued that King had <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0607"/>no alternative but to grant him mandate when George
                            Papandreou refused invitation to meeting to discuss ecumenical-type
                            govt. King knew, of course, that Papandreou was opposed to idea of an
                            ecumenical govt, and even if meeting had been held, chances were party
                            leaders could not agree.</p>
                        <p>2. By granting mandate to Kanellopoulos, King has openly committed
                            himself to <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> which probably has
                            support of between 35% to 40% of population. This is obviously narrow
                            ground on which to base his future. (King has undoubtedly hoped that FDK
                            and Progressives would vote for Kanellopoulos for sake of electoral bill
                            and that their support would give to government appearance of broader
                            base.) No only has King provoked <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and
                            EK, both moderates and <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> supporters, but he also has deeply embittered
                            Progressive and FDK deputies who feel they have been left in lurch after
                            they came to King's rescue in July 1965. They have now unhappy choice of
                            either voting for <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> Govt or going to
                            elections under an electoral system which is to their disadvantage.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> has bitterly
                            remarked to us that FDK and probably <persName corresp="#p_TE1">Tsirimokos</persName> and Progressives will abstain if
                            Kanellopoulos Govt conducts elections.</p>
                        <p>3. For time being, George Papandreou seems to be following cautious
                            policy, despite his strong criticism of King and Kanellopoulos and his
                            warning of a “revolution.” We have impression that both Papandreous are
                            frightened by present situation, Andreas because of possibility of his
                            arrest and imprisonment and George because of chance of postponement of
                            elections and constitutional deviation. EK leader still seems to believe
                            that, notwithstanding <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> Govt, his
                            party will gain at least plurality in elections. Therefore, he has shown
                            no interest in <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName>'
                            proposal that EK, FDK, etc. announce that they will abstain from
                            elections. Panpandreou might change his mind, however, if he became
                            convinced that elections would be rigged to make <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> first party. His attitude would undoubtedly be
                            different if Andreas was arrested prior to elections.</p>
                        <p>4. Hope of <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> has undoubtedly been that
                            right of dissolution would be sufficient weapon to persuade smaller
                            parties to support Govt and that psychological and material benefits of
                            office would give party a significant advantage in electoral campaign.
                            Though <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> has spoken confidently
                            of an <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> victory, he would probably not
                            be unduly disappointed if his party emerged as close second to EK. We
                            believe hard-core <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> ministers, on
                            other hand, would be willing to proceed to elections only if they were
                            certain of <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>'s achieving first place.
                            They would argue that if EK won plurality, it could form govt with
                                <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> support and that this
                            possibility could not be risked. Therefore, we fear that <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> will soon realize that 45 days is not
                            enough time to change situation appreciably <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0608"/>and that effort will be made to find a pretext to
                            postpone elections, if necessary, through a deviation from
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>5. It is difficult to convey gloom over future developments which exists
                            in political circles. Especially dismaying is present deep lack of trust
                            between political leaders themselves as well as notably between King and
                            both Papandreous and also between King and <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName>. Latter two, who believe King deliberately
                            deceived them recently and who despise Kanellopoulos personally, seem to
                            feel no sense of responsibility to try to help avoid collision course on
                            which country is now heading. In our view, there are basically two
                            options (a) for King and <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> to push
                            ahead to elections in late May despite opposition of all other parties;
                            or (b) for King to try to promote formation of inter-party government.
                            Situation might still be salvaged if Kanellopoulos could be persuaded to
                            step aside and to give up his right to dissolve Parliament and if <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>, FDK and Progressives could agree on
                            inter-party govt. Everyone agrees, however, that hour is late.</p>

                            dated April 3,<note n="3" xml:id="d269fn3">Not found.</note> I gave King
                            Constantine five-part answer Saturday evening to his question of March
                            29 whether he could count on United States support should he be forced
                            to undertake a constitutional deviation. I reassured him of continuing
                            United States interest at highest level in Greece's difficult situation.
                            I said we share his concern over policies that might be adopted by
                            government with <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>
                            as leading figure but believe certain restraints could operate to keep
                            such a government from at least some of extreme measures Andreas now
                            advocating. I expressed our agreement with the King's hopes that current
                            difficulties can be overcome through parliamentary processes. I stated
                            the inability of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to <pb n="571" xml:id="pg_571" facs="0609"/>give advance assurances of support to
                            King and noted our traditional opposition to dictatorial solutions to
                            constitutional crises. They are wrong in principle and rarely work yet
                            create many new difficulties. A dictatorship in Greece might cause
                            short-term upheavals, leading to more repressive measures, and to
                            coalescence of opposition forces which in turn could be penetrated and
                            dominated by international Communist agents. Adverse international
                            reactions would not be limited to the Communist apparatus but would
                            include supporters of democracy. Considerable criticism could be
                            expected in United States. Finally, I restated as a guiding principle of
                            United States in Eastern Mediterranean our policy to encourage progress
                            and stability in Greece and to maintain close relations with Greece.</p>
                        <p>The King responded with thanks, but felt many questions remained
                            unanswered. His own key question about risks inherent in a Papandreou
                            victory related to control of the armed forces. He anticipated that a
                            Papandreou government would move rapidly to retire or transfer officers
                            loyal to the King and move Papandreou adherents into positions of trust,
                            thus effectively ending the King's control of armed forces. This would
                            destroy his ability to keep Greece free and attached to West. He asked
                            whether this is what United States wished.</p>
                        <p>In response to my prodding the King conceded that constitutional crisis
                            might arise as early as coming week. Kanellopoulos government is
                            scheduled to appear before Parliament and will probably have to dissolve
                            it for lack of vote of confidence. I asked whether this could
                            immediately precipitate question of arresting <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>. King said it could, though no
                            decision to arrest him has been made. Consequences of his arrest should
                            it occur could raise issue whether elections would have to be postponed
                            and Greece ruled for a period by a government without parliamentary
                            sanction.</p>
                        <p>The King estimated that next critical moment could come in mid- May if
                                <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> party had by then failed to
                            develop electoral lead which Kanellopoulos but few others expect it to
                            achieve. At that point the King would have to decide whether to let
                            elections proceed. At that point also he would want American assurances.
                            Most important of these, he said, would be assurances that Greece would
                            continue to be protected against its northern neighbors, that U.S. would
                            help keep Turkey from taking advantage in Cyprus of Greece's
                            difficulties, that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would help
                            American public and other countries understand need to stabilize Greek
                            situation and protect Greece from Communist penetration of sort that
                            almost succeeded in the 1940's, and that economic assistance would be
                            available to enable the new government to meet basic problems of Greek
                            economy. He asked whether he could get further clarification of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> position.</p>
                        <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0610"/>
                        <p>I emphasized that in other situations, such as in Argentina, where
                            extra-constitutional governments had been imposed, American actions had
                            been different from what he had in mind. I repeated that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would watch situation closely, but
                            discouraged him from expecting further statement of American position at
                            this time.</p>
                        <p>It was clear that young King believes his throne and Greece's attachment
                            to the West to be at stake in this crisis. He has concluded that only
                            near miracle can save him from final choice of yielding his country to
                            Papandreou, or establishing a dictatorship either before or just after
                            elections scheduled in May. More clearly than in any previous
                            conversation, he expressed his dependence on United States for general
                            support. I would anticipate his continuing to ask for American
                            reassurances, with ever shorter deadlines as the scheduled electoral
                            date approaches.</p>

                        <p>4650. 1. My expectation is that Kanellopoulos government, acting on
                            decree by King, will dissolve Parliament tonight or tomorrow and will
                            announce elections May 28. This situation follows several days of
                            intense efforts, primarily by FDK elements, to gain approval of concept
                            of an ecumenical government. It also follows period of largely
                            unsuccessful <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0611"/>efforts by <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> to obtain FDK and Progressive Party
                            support of Kanellopoulos government. Both King and <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> obviously miscalculated in their
                            estimate that two smaller national parties would give <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> vote of confidence for sake of
                            simple proportional electoral law.</p>
                        <p>2. FDK view, as expressed to Embassy by <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> and <hi rend="italic"> Eleftheria </hi>
                            publisher Kokkas, has been that <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>
                            government would inevitably lead to dictatorship prior to elections and
                            that only way to avoid this disaster would be for King to make final
                            effort to form ecumenical government to pass electoral bill and to
                            postpone elections until 1968. FDK theory has been that Papandreou would
                            probably refuse initially to participate in ecumenical government and
                            that <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>, FDK, and Progressives would
                            then be in better position to form coalition government. Neither <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> nor Papandreou, however, was receptive
                            to FDK proposal. <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> was naturally
                            reluctant to give up fruits of office and to admit defeat, and
                            Papandreou argued that ecumenical government would be an unworkable
                            political “monstrosity.” FDK proposal was also weakened when Papandreou
                            reportedly enticed six or seven FDK deputies away from party by promise
                            they would be eventually re-admitted to Center Union. Votes of these six
                            or seven, plus 122 of EK and 22 of <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss>,
                            could thus make it virtually impossible for coalition of other parties
                            to win vote of confidence in house of 300.</p>
                        <p>3. Having seen <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName>,
                                <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, and
                            Kanellopoulos in past few days, I called on George Papandreou today and
                            found him, like other leaders, in self-righteous, unyielding mood. EK
                            leader asserted that King had made major blunder by giving mandate to
                            Kanellopoulos and that he has now ceased to be King of all Hellenes. “He
                            is now King of <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>,” and must suffer
                            fate of any party leader. Papandreou made repeatedly clear that, if
                            Parliament is dissolved and country is led to elections by <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> government, it will no longer be just
                            Andreas, but all of EK including himself who will be conducting
                            anti-monarchical campaign. Elder Papandreou also warned that if
                            dictatorship occurs, he will wage civil war. In his view, only exodus
                            from present crisis would be for King to name service government of
                            common confidence to conduct free and honest elections. Such a
                            government could be given an ecumenical flavor by having each party
                            designate a Minister without portfolio as an observer. Otherwise
                            Papandreou made no concession to idea of ecumenical government.</p>
                        <p>4. This evening King's political advisor <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> visited me to pass on latest thinking of Palace.
                            Part of <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>' presentation was
                            detailed account of how George Papandreou had repeatedly broken his
                            promises to King between December when <persName corresp="#p_PJ1">Paraskevopoulos</persName> government was formed and late March. EK
                            leader had specifically failed to live up to his written promise to
                            expel Andreas if latter deviated from party line and attacked monarchy.
                            Turning to today's developments, <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> reported <pb n="574" xml:id="pg_574" facs="0612"/>that, following careful consideration by King, Palace intermediary was
                            authorized this afternoon to make following proposal to Papandreou:
                            formation of ecumenical government under non-politician of common
                            confidence with Cabinet representation from all parties to pass simple
                            electoral bill and to conduct elections May 28, provided two largest
                            parties, i.e., <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> and EK, would make
                            written promise to cooperate in a post-electoral government for 6, 8 or
                            10 months.</p>
                        <p>5. Later this evening <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>
                            telephoned me that Papandreou had not only rejected this proposal but
                            had also made “threats.” (These, I presume, were same threats he had
                            expressed earlier today to me regarding anti-monarchical campaign, etc.)
                                <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> added that <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> has been informed of Papandreou's
                            response and that he will be in touch with King later tonight. In my and
                            my colleagues view, King's last minute approach to Papandreou was not
                            really serious effort to find another solution, since he could hardly
                            have expected Papandreou to sign paper promising to cooperate with
                                <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> after elections. Even if elder
                            Papandreou had accepted, Andreas would surely have disagreed and would
                            probably have broken away from party.</p>
                        <p>6. All this gives only highlights of recent fast-moving events which will
                            be reported in detail later and which have been characterized by
                            blunders, miscalculations, distrust and stubbornness on all sides. In
                            last few days, insatiable vivacity of Greeks for quarreling among
                            themselves seems to have triumphed over their traditional knack for
                            producing compromises.</p>

                        <p>1. I regret to report time has come to hoist urgent storm signals from
                            Greece. Through multiple blunders of past fortnight instability endemic
                            since July 1965 has deteriorated into imminent danger of first-class
                            mess leading country to brutal choice between dictatorship and <pb n="575" xml:id="pg_575" facs="0613"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>-led attacks on
                            monarch and probably Greece's foreign alignment.</p>
                        <p>2. Our reporting has supplied details and, I hope, has adequately
                            signalled threat to U.S. interests. In summary, Greek failure to find
                            acceptable solution to 21-month political impasse has led principal
                            players not to try harder but to dig deeper into inflexibly polarized
                            positions. With King and one party (<gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>)
                            now aligned against rest of political field, traditional instruments of
                            power—Palace, armed forces, conservative political and economic
                            interests—find themselves ranged against all centrists as well as
                            leftist elements, undoubtedly representing majority of population, who
                            in turn act increasingly frustrated, angry, anti-monarchical and
                            probably anti-Alliance.</p>
                        <p>3. <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> Kanellopoulos as well as
                            Papandreous and apparently bulk of voting population still want election
                            May 28, but nobody can expect these to be ordinary elections. In
                            relatively free elections under existing electoral system, Papandreous
                            predicted to come in probably with clear majority and at least as
                            leading party, depending on popular groundswell and also largely on how
                            much strength Communist-line <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> diverts
                            from its own candidates to Andreas-supported centrists.</p>
                        <p>4. This wouldn't be too bad if George Papandreou would emerge as boss. At
                            age 80, however, he's lost biological race to his son Andreas, only
                            other leader of vigor now in party, and a government with Andreas either
                            as backstage manager or at helm would—as we evaluate thrust of his
                            campaign—transform military high command into a party-controlled
                            instrument and thus effectively break authority of King and traditional
                            influentials in this country. United States would not necessarily find
                            that and various domestic programs projected by Andreas so damaging
                            except that they would give him springboard for foreign policies that
                            sound like a Mediterranean Bhutto's. Comfortable and satisfactory
                            Greek-U.S. relationship of past 20 years would inescapably yield to
                            kinds of strains we are experiencing not only in Pakistan but in too
                            many other countries. By all signs visible here, Russians would not be
                            slow to take advantage.</p>
                        <p>5. Fearing such consequences of adverse election results next month,
                            coteries in Palace, armed forces and <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>
                            are evidently building up steam for “constitutional deviation,” meaning
                            dictatorship. They would hope to set things straight by period of firm
                            rule and control of radicals. While their script is unclear, we presume
                            that after dissolution of Parliament, and probably in May if election
                            prospects then look unfavorable to them, current <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> government would be transformed into an emergency
                            government with, initially, civilian Ministers backed up by armed forces
                            under orders of King. Whether difficulties in enforcing order and
                            meeting national problems would subsequently lead to direct <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0614"/>army takeover is hard to perceive, as
                            is method by which authoritarian rule would later make way for
                            resumption of democratic government.</p>
                        <p>6. How to escape both Scylla and Charybdis? The King muffed best chance
                            ten days ago when he failed to get smaller parties opposing Papandreous
                            (FDK and Progressives) into governing combine with <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>. With <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>, the “authentic”
                                <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> leader, still in Paris, I am not
                            sure even most powerful effort by King would have brought Kanellopoulos
                            and small parties under same roof; at any rate, his milder efforts
                            failed.</p>
                        <p>7. Since then, extremely limited remaining options have been intensively
                            explored. We are told tonight that no nourishment has been found in any
                            of possible alternatives to present course.</p>
                        <p>8. It now appears that Greece will proceed toward elections May 28 with
                            King hoping <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> can garner enough
                            support to hold Center Union to plurality. This result, still possible
                            though not now probable, would be acceptable solution. It would enable
                            King to insist on post-electoral coalition government excluding <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and excluding Andreas from sensitive
                            security ministries.</p>
                        <p>9. This is result I believe we should next encourage diplomatically and
                            with whatever resources can be made available to us. Although it will
                            open us to charge of consorting with rightwing, that is preferable to
                            visible alternatives.</p>
                        <p>10. If <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> campaign falters under Center
                            Union attacks on it and on King leaving prospect in mid-May of clear
                            Center Union majority, then I believe dictatorship can be avoided if at
                            all only by very heavy American pressures on Palace, armed forces and
                            rightist politicians. From here I cannot judge what would be domestic US
                            reaction to dictatorship in Greece, though I suppose it would produce
                            new attacks (generated in part by anti-Royalist Greek-Americans) on
                            administration's alleged support of rightwing, militaristic, monarchical
                            regimes and would deepen difficulties encountered by military assistance
                            program on Capitol Hill. In any case, efforts cited earlier in this
                            message would set Greece far back domestically and internationally and
                            in end might not save either monarchy or Western orientation, though
                            immediate foreign policy of authoritarian regime would presumably be
                            pro-US.</p>
                        <p>11. As you know, King and Kanellopoulos have told me Greece “will not” be
                            delivered to <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>.
                            Nonetheless, we must consider this possibility if we are to oppose
                            dictatorship. My own view is that key question—to which I have no
                            present answer—is whether basic Greek institutions can withstand shock
                            of Andreas' takeover attempts so that further elections could be assured
                            after couple of years or so. Based on his past record of executive
                            performance, I believe Greek people would then reject him and excesses
                            of his fiscal and administrative policies. In these circumstances we
                            could live for a while with his abrasive if not defiant policies.
                            However, Andreas strikes me as capable in adversity <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0615"/>of dismantling traditional Greek
                            institutions and policies if he is permitted to do so and to lead
                            country even deeper into Nasserist posture.</p>
                        <p>12. Whole picture has many imponderables, of course. Questions that
                            cannot now be answered but could vitally affect situation include such
                            as when and how <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>
                            will return to Greek scene, when George Papandreou will disappear and
                            effect of this on his party, and whether some new leader capable of
                            challenging Andreas will emerge.</p>
                        <p>13. As any US action in this situation would need to be speedy and
                            decisive, I should like to discuss issues personally with you and others
                            before crunch comes. For this purpose I may ask soon to come to
                            Washington for few days.</p>
                        <p>14. Meanwhile we have been urging conciliation and compromise on party
                            leaders (though whether they have been listening is another question)
                            and, as detailed in recent reports, in recent talks with King I have
                            stated with increasing plainness our views of dangers in situation.</p>
                        <p>15. Sorry to burden you with this lengthy message, but despite your other
                            preoccupations I fear you need now to be specifically informed on
                            looming dangers here.</p>

                        <p>179151. For Ambassador from <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>.</p>
                        <p>1. We have studied closely your recent messages describing the grave
                            situation in Greece and dilemma facing King of (1) imposing dictatorship
                            or (2) permitting CU to assume power following next elections with
                            possible far-reaching consequences for Greece and its relations with US.
                            We have pondered carefully question of what, if any, steps <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> might take to meet situation and
                            propose following formula for your consideration and comment.</p>
                        <p>2. We are working on assumption Papandreou's chief fear at present time
                            is arrest of his son Andreas for alleged membership in Aspida <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578" facs="0616"/>conspiracy. Arrest of Andreas
                            could easily touch off violent demonstrations which in turn would be met
                            by extreme repressive measures by government and possible imposition of
                            dictatorship. On other hand, King's deepest fear is that if Papandreous
                            win elections, Center Union will move immediately to strip King of his
                            power by major shakeup in military forces and intelligence setup, with
                            eventual aim of undermining and perhaps eliminating monarchy. Concurrent
                            to this is general concern that younger Papandreou would move Greece
                            away from Western Alliance.</p>
                        <p>3. Proposed scenario would be that you call on George Papandreou at
                            earliest opportunity, and inform him on instructions that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> deeply concerned at present rift in
                            Greek body politic and increasing polarization due to extreme positions
                            being taken by both sides. You would emphasize that we have great stake
                            in future of Greece as result of major US investment in men, money, and
                            matériel dating from 1947. We consider prosperous Greece is essential to
                            Western Alliance. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is fully aware of
                            Papandreou's devotion to democracy, his long history of anti-Communism,
                            and his dedication to welfare of his country.</p>
                        <p>4. You could add that as we view situation, cooling off of highly charged
                            political atmosphere could result from an agreement on both sides to
                            moderate language in public statements and speeches. (This would seem to
                            be particularly important at present juncture, since elder Papandreou is
                            about to make one of his two major speeches this Sunday in Thessaloniki.
                            Extremist remarks on that occasion would set unfortunate tone for entire
                            campaign and might increase tensions, already dangerously high, to
                            breaking point.)</p>
                        <p>5. To meet problem outlined para 2 we would propose compromise based on
                            iron-clad assurances from both sides. Our formula would envision
                            assurance from King to G. Papandreou that <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> would not be arrested, in return for
                            following two concessions from Papandreou, on assumption he wins May 28
                            elections: (1) that he appoint only persons of “mutual confidence” to
                            sensitive positions of Foreign Affairs and Defense and (2) that he not
                            carry out widespread shakeup in armed forces leadership. FYI, these two
                            assurances from Papandreou would appear to be minimum concessions
                            acceptable to King to stay his hand from imposing dictatorship in event
                            CU wins majority in elections. End FYI.</p>
                        <p>6. You should attempt to induce George Papandreou to put such a
                            compromise formula forward to Palace on his own. If he will not see King
                            but asks you to help, you could serve as “honest broker” and convey
                            compromise proposal to King.</p>
                        <p>7. None of elements in proposed formula is sacrosanct and we leave it to
                            you to modify them according to prevailing conditions there. If you
                            perceive major objection to recommended action, we would welcome <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0617"/>countersuggestions from you.
                            However we feel time is of essence in view of fast-moving developments
                            in Greece, including Papandreou's opening speech this weekend and
                            indications that government may be moving to arrest <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>. If latter happens,
                            it may be too late to play constructive role in this deteriorating
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>8. Would appreciate your comments urgently as to wisdom foregoing
                            proposal. Please include your thoughts re dangers, charges US meddling
                            in internal situation. Also comment on possibility approach being made

                        <p>1. On basis still fragmentary information I have formed tentative
                            impression that coup was triggered this morning by small army group not
                            including High Command, King or civilian political leaders. Service
                            Chiefs of Staff, faced with question of whether they would cooperate,
                            all appear to be joined and to be actively participating in planning
                            next steps. Military command seems united and now fully committed to
                            coup. King also appears no longer to fear possible arrest as he did when
                            Defense Attaché talked with him at 0415 local time<note n="2" xml:id="d273fn2">Telegram 4746 from Athens, April 21, reported that
                                the Defense Attaché had called Tatoi Palace at approximately 5 a.m.
                                to “find out what was going on.” King Constantine answered that he
                                had no clear idea of what was happening, adding: “They are headed
                                this way for me. Get word to Sixth Fleet. Get word to Washington and
                                have them send your army in.” (Ibid.)</note> but rather to have
                            joined with military leadership in considering where to go next.
                            Presumably he was asked about military leadership and all have
                            emphasized their fidelity to King and to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>2. We have been told most members of Kanellopoulos government in

                        <p>3. Because we had heard rumors that some political prisoners might suffer
                            harm, I had Chief JUSMAGG and Defense Attaché call on General <persName corresp="#p_PLGC1">Papadatos</persName> to convey messages any such
                            actions would greatly increase complications of already complicated
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>4. So far as we know, Athens, Thessaloniki, Crete and all other parts of
                            the country are quiet now.</p>
                        <p>5. I see no present indication of resistance to the coup.<note n="3" xml:id="d273fn3">In a memorandum for the President, April 21,

                            bloodshed and violence would not only have most unfortunate implications

                            serious repercussions outside of Greece, especially in US. Amb. observed
                            we had been informed that King had not in fact signed emergency decree
                            suspending certain articles of Constitution and that as far as we aware
                            meeting between King and senior military officers still continuing. This
                            suggests to us serious disagreement does in fact exist.</p>
                        <p>4. Chant and Schacter appeared highly skeptical that coup may have been
                            staged without King's approval. Chant commented if Andreas were executed
                            there would without question be revolution in which many people would
                            lose their lives. He said that in light seriousness situation Margaret

                            would be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>5. Ambassador expressed sympathy for their anxieties regarding personal
                            safety of Andreas. He again assured them US has and would by every means
                            discourage Greek military leaders from any resort to violence or
                            bloodshed and to an appreciation of serious damage which <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0620"/>would result both within Greece and in

                        <p>4787. 1. King Constantine, blazingly angry, has just told me that neither
                            he nor General officers control Greek army tonight. “Incredibly stupid
                            ultra-rightwing bastards, having gained control of tanks, have brought
                            disaster to Greece,” he said.</p>
                        <p>2. According to King, government which he swore in tonight was forced
                            upon him after five-hour rough session with coup leaders during which he
                            had wrung sole concession that it be headed by civilian.<note n="2" xml:id="d275fn2">King Constantine subsequently provided <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> with a detailed account of

                            his Palace then surrounded by tanks loyal to them.</p>
                        <p>3. King is unsure of next developments. He asked how long it would take
                            helicopters to reach Tatoi to evacuate his family if needed. He also
                            asked whether any possibility U.S. Marines could be landed in Greece if
                            necessary to help him and Generals reassert their control over armed
                            forces. He expressed view Greek troops would not fire at U.S.
                            Marines.</p>
                        <p>4. King also asked if I could make strongest démarche to his new
                            government to insist that it not only maintain order and protect
                            civilians who have been arrested but also strictly follow orders of
                            King. He proposed that I say “U.S. will hold King responsible for
                            actions of this government and government responsible to King.”</p>
                        <p>5. At King's request we have arranged and will attempt to maintain
                            emergency communications directly with Royal Palace at Tatoi.</p>
                        <p>6. I have just talked with General Spandidakis and Nick Farmarkis, now
                            his aide, and have obtained immediate appointment with new Prime
                            Minister. I will assert that I am speaking on instructions and state we
                            look to the government to maintain order, we insist that they open up
                            communications for stranded Americans and call strongly upon government
                            to restore normal life as rapidly as possible. With all force we call
                            upon government to protect detainees from physical harm, and I will
                            assert that United States, which gives Greece much assistance, will
                            watch developments minutely. I will also express our support for role of
                            King as Chief of State.</p>
                        <p>7. Important to hold King's comments closely at this time.</p>

                        <p>4792. 1. By mutual request, I called 2200 local time on PriMin <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> at his office in presence of
                            Vice Premier and Def. Min. Gen. Spandidakis.</p>
                        <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0622"/>
                        <p>2. In introductory comment, PriMin asserted that today's developments
                            were prompted by grave Communist threat to Greece and by decision of
                            army to thwart this threat. Army has established complete control
                            throughout country without any bloodshed. PriMin emphasized that purpose
                            of his government is to protect freedoms of all Greeks and to restore
                            normality as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>3. Gen Spandidakis broke in to report, as we knew, that telephone
                            communications have been restored and other communications would return
                            to normal tomorrow. In response to my question regarding well-being of
                            people arrested today, Spandidakis stated former PriMin Kanellopoulos,
                            Papaligouras, and other people in <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss>
                            govt would be released tonight immediately after our conversation or at
                            latest Saturday morning. He said that George Papandreou, but not
                            Andreas, would also be released, although he did not specify when.
                            Spandidakis assured me that none of detainees would be physically
                            harmed.</p>
                        <p>4. I told PriMin that, acting on instructions from my government<note n="2" xml:id="d276fn2">In telegram 180319 to Athens, April 21, the
                                Department of State approved the approach outlined by <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> in telegram 4787 from
                                Athens, <ref target="#d275">Document 275</ref>. The telegram
                                contained an estimate that U.S. helicopters could evacuate the Royal
                                family within 36 hours of a request. It further instructed <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> to disabuse the King of any
                                notion of a U.S. military intervention, adding that it was “alarmed”
                                by the tenor of Constantine's report to <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>: “Admittedly he is not calling all the shots
                                but riding herd on this faction of the Greek army and political
                                spectrum would not seem to hold nearly the same dangers as he would
                                have faced had an Aspida-type military team moved in.” (Department
                                of State, Central Files, POL 23 GREECE)</note> I must state (a) that
                            we were deeply distressed by today's developments, including the use of
                            American-furnished equipment to overthrow the constitutional government
                            of Greece, and (b) that we will look to government to maintain order,
                            open communications to stranded Americans, and restore normal life as
                            rapidly as possible. Spandidakis reported that communications will be
                            restored by tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>5. Gen. Eaton, who was with me, and I also expressed great concern over
                            use of American-supplied equipment in today's coup. PriMin responded
                            that he was also sorry that use was made of this matériel, but that
                            action was absolutely essential in view of Communist threat. By
                            Communist, he explained that he meant not only those who belong to
                            extreme left but also those who “sympathize” with them. (In latter
                            category he undoubtedly was thinking of Andreas.) PriMin asserted that,
                            had military not acted, another Viet-Nam might have occurred in Greece
                            and country might have fallen in Iron Curtain abyss. Neither Spandidakis
                            nor PriMin was precise in explaining what exactly had happened to
                            trigger coup.</p>
                        <p>6. I responded that I hoped (a) that if army was instrument of coup it
                            would plainly be under control of senior military leaders not of junior
                            officers, and (b) that new government would be completely loyal to and
                                <pb n="585" xml:id="pg_585" facs="0623"/>responsive to orders of
                            King. PriMin and Spandidakis both alleged that government is devoted to
                            King and strong supporter of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. They
                            expressed hope that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, as in past,
                            could count on support of US.</p>
                        <p>7. Asked about calling of Parliament into session, PriMin told me that
                            Parliament could not meet until elections were held and that latter
                            depended on developments. In any case, he hoped that normal conditions
                            would soon be restored and that elections could be conducted at an early
                            time.</p>
                        <p>8. Observing both <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> and
                            Spandidakis tonight, I was confirmed in my impression that PriMin is
                            merely front-man and that real power rests with military. Question is
                            which military.<note n="3" xml:id="d276fn3">In an April 22 memorandum to

                        <p>(1) That for present we continue fairly starchy posture toward new Greek
                            Government but still stay in touch with it and not burn bridges by
                            threatening cutoff of aid and other drastic measures unless government's
                            performance in next few days is rough and rotten.</p>
                        <p>(2) That I attempt to stay in closest possible communication with King
                            and that we rapidly canvass steps which could strengthen his hand, since
                            King likely can prove principal focus for restoring normalcy. While I do
                            not now expect situation to require emergency evacuation of Royal
                            family, urgent response to King's request on helicopters would be
                            practically and psychologically valuable.<note n="2" xml:id="d277fn2">See <ref target="#d276fn2">footnote 2, Document 276</ref>.</note>

                            for process of changing governments by military coups but also reflect a
                            certain slowness to pass moral judgments since there remain so many gaps
                            in our understanding of what has happened and why.<note n="3" xml:id="d277fn3">In telegram 4797 from Athens, April 22, <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> commented: “So far as I

                        <p>180648. For Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>1. In fast-moving situation facing King and yourself, we recognize we
                            unable to give close and current guidance. However, following are basic
                            points which we believe should govern King's actions and which we
                            suggest you convey to him as opinion <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>:</p>
                        <p>(a) We believe it essential that the King remain in Greece.</p>
                        <p>(b) We believe he should not depart from Greece except under duress.</p>
                        <p>(c) We think that his position vis-à-vis the military officers
                            controlling the government is stronger than he appears to think and that
                            he should use what we consider to be their considerable need for him to
                            extract from them the maximum concessions.</p>
                        <p>(d) We think that his efforts vis-à-vis the coup officers should be
                            toward reaching a compromise of type which will make it clear to Greek
                            people that King has not capitulated but has forced military leaders to
                            make significant concessions. We are not informed as to what other
                            points may be at issue between King and the governing military group
                            except the questions of suspension of articles of Constitution and the
                                <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0625"/>martial law decree. But
                            there must be other matters, such as ratio of civilian vs. military in
                            Cabinet, which could be used as bargaining points to off-set concessions
                            which for example might be made regarding martial law decree. Latter
                            concessions might involve limiting decree to specified time and
                            moderating provisions calling for extreme restrictions on civil
                            liberties.</p>
                        <p>(e) If King is concerned about safety his wife and would feel better if
                            she could go somewhere else, we would be willing to help in this. We
                            believe it would be preferable for her not to leave Greek soil.</p>
                        <p>(f) Finally, while we recognize that decision as to capitulation vs.
                            resistance must be made by King alone, it is our view that if he
                            capitulates he will have lost all opportunity for leadership. This does
                            not mean that he may not have to compromise on some issues while showing
                            his own stamp on the situation as he forces others to compromise, we
                            would hope in as visible a manner as possible.<note n="2" xml:id="d278fn2">In telegram 4836 from Athens, April 22, <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> reported that the Embassy
                                had tried to maintain contact in the last 24 hours with new regime
                                “in order to exercise what influence we have toward more

                        <p>4856. 1. Sixty hours after coup Embassy estimates that new authoritarian
                            government is solidly in control. Key is unity of army. New command
                            appointments and military moods discerned by attaches and JUSMAGG
                            strengthen belief that no significant opposition exists to present
                            control of armed forces.</p>
                        <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>2. Chances of countercoup, never bright, have sunk hour by hour and now
                            seem virtually nil. King, whose surprise at and opposition to coup is
                            becoming increasingly widely recognized here, presumably is also
                            recognizing coup as fait accompli.</p>
                        <p>3. Coup is revolutionary. Its central core—Papadopoulos, described as the
                            top theoretician; Patakos, the top executive; and Makerezos—are limited,
                            politically inexperienced, tough-minded, no-nonsense types setting out
                            to “purify” Greek political, social and economic life. Their manifesto
                            sounds like Ayub in 1958. Also like 1958 model Ayub, they declare
                            themselves thousand percent pro-American and are urgently seeking any
                            hint of American understanding of what they're doing. With or without
                            it, they know they must succeed or lose their heads.</p>
                        <p>4. If military coup in this <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> country
                            has demolished liberal political reputation of Greece, oddly enough
                            failure of coup—once attempted—would have been even greater disaster.
                            Coup effort pushed aside political moderates and conservatives (as
                            represented by Kanellopoulos government and its supporters) who were
                            duped not by their enemies but by group with roughly similar anxieties
                            about strong leftist trends in Greece. Had coup failed, carrying
                            conservatives and moderates down with it, only beneficiaries would have
                            been far leftist segment of Greek political life. Greece would then have
                            surely gone where rightists fear <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> was taking it.</p>
                        <p>5. While it is early to judge causes of coup, personality and policies of
                                <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> may be
                            prime reason Greece today is under dictatorship. King, moderate
                            centrists and moderate conservatives had all been opposing
                            ultra-rightist convictions that only the army could safeguard Greece
                            from Communism. Andreas' style and the thrust of his threats to the
                            Greek “establishment”, particularly the armed forces, were alien to
                            normal to-ing and fro-ing of Greek political life. Because they exceeded
                            bounds of Greek political tolerance and therefore induced deepest
                            distrust in rightist quarters especially the army, Andreas lost chance
                            to move Greece in directions he favored.</p>
                        <p>6. These thoughts are historical footnotes. Question is what direction to
                            take next. Until now Embassy has indicated readiness to stay in
                            communication with new government and top military leadership but has
                            coldly pointed out American reaction to overthrow of parliamentary
                            government of a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> ally by military
                            establishment trained and equipped by Americans. We have been all but
                            rude to Spandidakis and others in cross-examining their assertions that
                            they and other properly constituted commanders are actually in control
                            of army. Without predicting what policy lines United States might adopt
                            we have spelled out possible consequences in short words. We have made
                            sure arrival of Sixth Fleet task force group in Greek waters has not
                            gone unnoticed by<pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0627"/> top people.
                            If we haven't educated the mule, at least we have given it those knocks
                            required to get its attention.<note n="2" xml:id="d279fn2">In telegram
                                4901 from Athens, April 24, the Embassy reported “deep distress” on
                                the part of the coup leaders to the “negative reaction” of the

                        </p>
                        <p>7. Now that we have its attention, what do we say? From our vantage point
                            here, what is essential is to get Greece pointed again in direction of
                            some kind of government with consent of governed. Obviously this
                            government is not about to yield power to a political government.
                            Therefore, question is one of transitional arrangements. One possibility
                            is, for example, Vietnam pattern: a pledge by new government to proceed
                            toward election of a constituent assembly which in turn would produce
                            revised constitution subject to plebiscite. Another idea is
                            establishment by fiat of a national constitutional council consisting of
                            eminent jurists and others of unquestioned integrity and stature.
                            Whatever the mechanism, avowed steps toward restoration of
                            constitutional rule would give promise of way out from present
                            dictatorial deadend.</p>
                        <p>8. There are fragmentary indications that new government is hunting for
                            some such course. It badly needs cooperation and participation of
                            responsible conservatives, at least. Latter (of whom former Foreign
                            Minister Averoff and Bank of Greece Deputy John Pesmazoglu have already
                            expressed their anxieties to me) could contribute to solution. Moreover,
                            declaration of definite constitutional course by this government would
                            enable King to identify himself with specific constructive purposes and
                            thus bring him back into tolerable relationship with army and public
                            life. This would also help to justify in eyes of American public opinion
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cooperation with coup
                            government.</p>
                        <p>9. While maintaining stiffish attitude toward present government for time
                            being, I propose unless Department objects to stimulate exploration of
                            above ideas with key members of new government and with others who may
                            be in a position to influence this regime. I also propose to suggest it
                            to King as line worth considering to break current impasse.<note n="3" xml:id="d279fn3">In telegram 181282 to Athens, April 24, the

                        <p>4942. 1. During 75-minute conversation at Tatoi this evening King
                            Constantine appeared under considerably less strain than I had seen him
                            at any time since coup. He thought meetings with Cabinet members
                            yesterday had gone well. My net impression is that he is moving rapidly
                            to adjust his relations with coup government and has moderate
                            expectations of gradually regaining leadership of army and
                            government.</p>
                        <p>2. According to his account, meeting with Cabinet group Monday evening
                            went very satisfactorily. After berating coup instigators once again for
                            having moved without his knowledge, he had told them: “Now you have done
                            it and you are here. Now you must not fail.” Patakos had replied that
                            coup had already succeeded. King's response was that “not at all. You
                            have succeeded in taking country, but unless you succeed in running it
                            you have brought Greece to final disaster.” He had then lectured them on
                            need to get expert advice on economic and other problems and act
                            constructively and effectively. Cabinet members had repeatedly insisted
                            on their loyalty to King. In response to his repeated questions, they
                            had also insisted that army is loyal him.</p>
                        <p>3. King said he had pressed Cabinet hard on need to demonstrate to
                            Greece's allies that its goal is resumption of constitutional
                            government. Drawing on points discussed earlier between him and me,<note n="2" xml:id="d281fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> reported on
                                discussions with the King regarding treatment of the junta in
                                telegram 4840 from Athens, April 23. (Ibid.)</note> he had told them
                            that government must promptly set up some sort of constitution-drafting
                            committee to prepare revised constitution that would be examined by
                            government and then subjected to national plebiscite, after which
                            elections could be held under new constitution. To his great
                            satisfaction, they had agreed to announce this program. He had therefore
                            consented to attend Cabinet meeting Wednesday at which he believed major
                            item of business would be promulgation of new constitution-making
                            process.</p>
                        <p>4. I commented that main problem might be to obtain domestic and foreign
                            credibility. It would be easy to announce such a scheme, but who would
                            believe it? Perhaps Royal decree could be issued, committing both King
                            and government to fixed process. King said he would pursue this line
                            Wednesday.</p>
                        <pb n="592" xml:id="pg_592" facs="0630"/>
                        <p>5. I told King our main problem at moment is what sort of relations to
                            have with coup government. While question of recognition does not arise,
                            we remain exceedingly uncomfortable at having Greek ally under military
                            dictatorship. Embassy is showing this discomfort in cool and reserved
                            posture. Obviously, Americans would find it extremely difficult during
                            this period to deliver tanks and similar major weaponry to regime which
                            has used American-made tanks to overthrow established government. He
                            would understand that this would have to be our posture until Greek
                            Government itself sorts out its purposes and programs. Perhaps our
                            rather stiff posture might even help him re-establish his Kingly
                            position with this regime.</p>
                        <p>6. King agreed, adding that he hoped we would not get such an inflexible
                            position that we could not respond if this government should demonstrate
                            its readiness to return to constitutional rule. I commented that given
                            public and congressional opinion, this was a risk, but that unless this
                            government reached that state there was no prospect that American
                            reserve would melt. King said he understood.</p>
                        <p>7. King said he had finally faced Cabinet with protracted question of
                            unsigned decree declaring martial law and suspending certain articles of
                            the Constitution. He had told Cabinet that government had acted without
                            his signature, that he saw no sense in signing decree now and did not
                            propose to do so. There had been no visible reaction, so he thought he
                            probably had gotten away with this issue.</p>
                        <p>8. However, they insisted (Athens 4934)<note n="3" xml:id="d281fn3">Telegram 4934, April 25, reported on a meeting between the King and
                                    <persName>Colonel Papadopoulos</persName> and summarized the
                                King's comments on the meeting and recent developments in the
                                military. (Ibid.)</note> that his secretary, <persName corresp="#p_AMM1">Major Arnaoutis</persName>, go abroad and he had
                            agreed. This left him without staff. I suggested that anyone in his
                            position needed some confidant, and expressed the hope that he would
                            find someone who could effectively replace Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName> (who cravenly resigned at height
                            of crisis) and Major Arnaoutis.</p>
                        <p>9. King said Cabinet members had told him government greatly needs his
                            support and that public increasingly anxious because of stories he not
                            in accord with regime. They asked him to show himself at Easter eve
                            religious ceremonies next Saturday night and to take part in traditional
                            egg-cracking frivolities in army barracks. He said this depended on
                            whether army is truly loyal to him. He would reserve decision for some
                            days until he could get better reading. They professed army absolutely
                            loyal to King even though they and army commanders had acted without his
                            knowledge last Friday morning, “but only to protect you, Your
                            Majesty.”</p>
                        <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>10. King said these are people inexperienced in government who include
                            some really stupid types such as <persName corresp="#p_FN1">Farmakis</persName>, but that it now becomes his role to gain their
                            confidence, persuade them that he is not plotting a counter-coup, get
                            time to work on country's serious problems, and gradually reassert his
                            authority. I commented that this is sort of program that would require
                            his continuing to follow delicate path of neither embracing nor breaking
                            with coup group, and taking advantage of their need of him at early
                            stages to extract all vital concessions. He replied that he is type who

                        <p>11. I noted that since first night of coup I had not been in touch with
                            Ministers of new government but that Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> had summoned me for Wednesday
                            morning. I said I was asking instructions (Athens 4941).<note n="4" xml:id="d281fn4">Telegram 4941, April 25, requested permission to

                            expressed hope I could talk with Prime Minister to reinforce King's line

                        <p>12. I mentioned that Sixth Fleet task group is still in Aegean Sea though
                            it has other chores. If situation easing, did he think it might be on
                            its way? King replied that while government's true intentions may take
                            two or three weeks to come out, he now is confident he and his family
                            will stay in Greece. He would have no objection to departure of task
                            group, though he would hope it could come back rapidly if situation
                            should deteriorate. I said that we keep task groups always in
                            Mediterranean, which isn't such huge sea after all.</p>

                            rendezvoused today with Brigadier Patakos, Minister of Interior. We met
                            at the home of JUSMAGG officer with whom Patakos was associated at Fort
                            Knox in early 1950's and has worked in recent months on questions
                            related to armor training center which Patakos commanded. Initially
                            somewhat reserved but later open, Patakos quickly expressed pro-American
                            attitudes and identified his American connections. These include
                            siblings in Sioux City, Iowa and Salt Lake City and two nephews who are
                            officers in US Army, one a major in DOD/ASCI and the other a dental
                            officer in Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>2. Patakos impressed me along lines we have heard him described. As
                            military operator, precise and effective executive, who insists he is in
                            a revolutionary movement but is himself no long-haired revolutionary
                            theorist. Like other coup leaders, he had been working almost without
                            sleep for a week, but was alert and energetic throughout our
                            conversation. After leaving me, he was to meet King at Tatoi.</p>
                        <p>3. After somewhat slow conversational start, I proposed we might proceed
                            by his commenting on questions that face <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as it attempts to understand what happened in Greece
                            and to sort out its policy in relation to new situation. He would
                            understand events of past week in Greece had come as great shock to us,
                            and that in interest of looking to future it would be well to be frank
                            and specific. Patakos agreed. He neither requested nor got any assurance
                            about U.S. policy. In answering my questions, he commented on purposes
                            of revolution, plans for constitution-writing, current status of
                            detainees, and intentions toward political prisoners. He repeatedly
                            referred to what has happened as “the revolution” and to present <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> as “the revolutionary government.” He
                            exuded confidence that revolution is irreversible fact, whether or not
                            US finally accepts proffered hand of friendship. With consolidation
                            effected, he emphasized current task is to look forward to running
                            government and returning to constitutional rule.</p>
                        <p>4. Patakos assured me he sincerely desires friendship of America. He
                            would be our friend even if we were not his. New <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had not made deep or broad plans prior to the coup but
                            had acted primarily to save situation <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0633"/>in Greece which leaders felt was rapidly deteriorating.
                            Now they are studying and planning to rectify all shortcomings they had
                            earlier suspected. They had not known all specifics before, but now with
                            opportunity to look into Ministries and other facets of government, they
                            feel able to develop concrete programs. Demagogues had split the Greek
                            people into factions and lawbreakers such as robbers and murderers could
                            be found on the streets. Greeks had even seen individual biting ear of a
                            policy official. Revolution has tried to unite country and cleanse Greek
                            life. In his own Ministry he had found civil servants sitting all day
                            doing nothing except drinking coffee. Now, like military, they have
                            daily planning conferences at 7 a.m. New government wishes to be more
                            responsive to public needs, and to bring tranquility to the people. It
                            should restore their confidence in economic and political facets of
                            Greek life.</p>
                        <p>5. We wasted little time on military aspects of takeover. As to ways in
                            which his group will move to next phase of governmental operations, he
                            had studied problems Ayub and Turkish military leaders had faced in
                            managing government after their military takeovers, and would draw on
                            their experience while adding essentially Greek approaches. With
                            confidence born of one week's experience, he felt sure new <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could operate Greece's official
                            establishment much more effectively than had its predecessors.</p>
                        <p>6. I asked about role of King. He reaffirmed that King had known nothing
                            about coup. He could not be a revolutionary, and therefore was kept out
                            until it fait accompli. King remains as head of state and head of army,
                            though not responsible for appointment of persons in government. (I do
                            not feel remarks I was able to draw from Patakos fully illuminates what
                            role new <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> expects to permit King to
                            play. My tentative conclusion is that Patakos, like most traditional
                            Greek politicians, views throne as useful unifying symbol, so long as
                            King doesn't interfere too much in their affairs. This aspect will bear
                            further watching.)</p>
                        <p>7. As to constitutional status, Patakos said Constitution has not been
                            suspended. He stated flatly <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will
                            shortly set up constitution commission of eminent jurists who will
                            determine what sort of Constitution Greece should have. They will draw
                            on experience of other states, such as US. They will examine why
                            Greece's affairs sank so low under existing constitution and what
                            changes would be necessary to prevent repetition. Proposed revisions, or
                            new Constitution, will be submitted to government and thence to
                            plebiscite. Once adopted, new Constitution would provide framework for
                            new elections. I asked how long this process would take. He did not
                            know, would not guess, and declined to be drawn into comment on my
                            speculation that it might take anything from a few months to a few
                            years. I asked when constitution-making process would be announced. He
                            said as soon as possible, which he defined as within <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0634"/>next few days. I commented that this
                            would be of considerable interest to my country, a nation deeply devoted
                            to democracy, which after military takeovers in such countries as
                            Pakistan, Turkey and South Vietnam had unfailingly and vigorously
                            encouraged existing authorities to take steps that would lead their
                            people back to constitutional and representative rule. Patakos said he
                            understood this. Process could start quickly in Greece.</p>
                        <p>8. I asked about situation of detainees. Patakos was carrying a folder
                            which he opened to reveal exact statistics and certain names that he was
                            about to report to King. (He asked me not to transmit these to
                            Washington until he had had chance to present them to King and Prime
                            Minister. To help establish basis for continuing relations, we will
                            telephone him tomorrow to get his approval for transmission of following
                            statistics to Washington.) According to Patakos, up to April 26, 6,500
                            prisoners had been taken into custody and 1,701 subsequently released,
                            leaving 5,437 still in custody. Of those, 1,558 had already been
                            installed in camps on Island of Yioura and 1,727 were now being shipped
                            in that direction by boat, leaving 2,152 still in detention on mainland.
                            Some of these latter would be sent to camps being constructed on Yioura
                            and on island of Makronisi.</p>
                        <p>9. For ease in handling, detainees being classified in three categories,
                            “A”,“B,” and “C”. Investigation of these people does not look to
                            misdeeds of long ago, presumably during the Communist war of 1946–49,
                            but rather to their current records. Persons in “A” category would be
                            quickly releasable if nothing adverse found. In “B” category are persons
                            not easily determined to be releasable but also not well-known
                            Communists or anarchists. These persons will be examined to determine
                            whether they should be put in “A” or “C” categories. In “C” category are
                            those individuals who are initially regarded as dangerous. If
                            investigation proves otherwise, some of these too could be released.
                            Others will be “instructed” and “re-educated” to become good
                            citizens.</p>
                        <p>10. In addition, Patakos spoke of 25 “special class” detainees in Athens,
                            33 others in provinces, and 4 in “special economic class.” These are
                            being held in hotels or at home under guard. (Names he mentioned being
                            transmitted separately.)<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3">In telegram 5016
                                from Athens, April 28. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>11. Patakos said <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>
                            is detained for two reasons. First, on charges of involvement in Aspida
                            conspiracy, he is being investigated by public prosecutor (this confirms
                            our understanding that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has decided
                            to bring Andreas to civil trial on Aspida charges, which as we
                            understand it could bring maximum sentence of 28 years). He is also
                            being held because of his declarations that he would cause revolution.
                            Patakos would not say that Andreas would be tried on these second <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0635"/>charges. His summary response
                            to my several questions was that Andreas would be held in detention
                            until they could be satisfied that he would not attempt revolution. I
                            concluded that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is thinking of
                            dealing with Andreas on civil charges unless he gets disagreeable in
                            which case he could be court martialed on second set of charges.</p>
                        <p>12. As to others, Patakos said <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> has now declared he is “with” government but
                            leaders of revolution unconvinced.<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">Telegram
                                4969 from Athens, April 26, reported that in his initial contact
                                with a U.S. Government official Patakos had explained that the junta
                                feared <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> would lead
                                an insurrection in Crete. Patakos added that <persName corresp="#p_MK2">Mitsotakis</persName> had shown hostility to
                                the new regime, but, as a fellow Cretan, he would try to secure his
                                release. (Ibid.)</note> He did not name economic detainees, but did
                            not dissent when I said we had heard these include Professor Stratis
                            Andreadis, Chairman of the Ionian Popular Bank and other financial and
                            industrial institutions, and Bank's general manager. Patakos said heavy
                            bank withdrawals on first days after coup had stopped suddenly when a
                            few bankers detained.</p>
                        <p>13. In response to my further questions, Patakos answered specifically
                            that regime intends to kill no one. All such rumors, including recent
                            stories of planned execution of Glazos (Athens 5013)<note n="5" xml:id="d282fn5">Not found.</note> are false. He warned however that
                            saboteurs would be dealt with severely—whatever that means.</p>
                        <p>14. Patakos summarized by restating strong desire to work closely with
                            Americans. Whether that possible or not he said, success of revolution
                            is sure.<note n="6" xml:id="d282fn6">In the conversation summarized in
                                footnote 4 above, Patakos concluded: “Just remember, we are with you
                                whether you want us or not.” This comment was reported to Secretary
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in an April 27

                        <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0636"/>
                        <p>1. Would appreciate receiving your early views on where we go from here
                            with new <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, and how fast.</p>
                        <p>2. There is feeling here that King seems to be giving way too rapidly in
                            his relationship with new regime and that perhaps he should be
                            withholding more cards at this time in order be able ensure meaningful
                            concessions.</p>
                        <p>3. There is also concern lest pressures within Greece for us to enter
                            into normal relationship with regime result in our moving in that
                            direction without having gained anything in return. We feel we must not
                            permit our leverage to be dissipated thus.</p>
                        <p>4. Regime has made a number of appropriate statements with regard to its
                            desire that Greece return to a constitutional situation but the timing
                            of this development is of course left imprecise.</p>
                        <p>5. Meanwhile hostile pressures against the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> are building up abroad and in this country, with urgent
                            reference to the fate of political detainees but also based on a
                            profound distaste for the coup regime.</p>
                        <p>6. Although we have spoken in general terms to the new leaders about need
                            to lift restrictions on civil liberties and to establish goal of
                            returning to constitutional normalcy, we have been precise so far only
                            with regard to detained political figures. We have been pondering
                            whether we should seek to pin regime down to a definite blueprint of
                            political steps in direction of normalcy and if so what this blueprint
                            should be and how soon we should put it forward. The price would
                            probably have to be the relaxation of our restrictions on military aid
                            and the commencement of normal relations with the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, with the resultant disadvantages for
                            the U.S. image. We would of course have to satisfy ourselves that the
                            regime meant what it said and that real progress in the direction
                            indicated was likely.</p>
                        <p>7. We wonder whether it would be a good idea for you to discuss this
                            whole question with the King in order to obtain his views. At same time
                            you might wish to intimate that from the tactical point of view it might
                            be better if the King should move more slowly in reaching an
                            accommodation with government leaders.</p>
                        <p>8. It has also been suggested here that we might use our present leverage
                            to try to push the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> further in the
                            direction of a Cyprus solution, perhaps by pressing for agreement on a
                            sovereign Turkish base on the island, or perhaps on the transfer of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>. We doubt we have
                            enough leverage to move the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> very far
                            on Cyprus, even should we decide to accept the disadvantages inherent in
                            trying.</p>
                        <p>9. Most of these are difficult questions to judge with any sense of
                            certainty, and we feel the need of your wise counsel in helping us
                            consider them.</p>

                        <p>1. We are keenly aware of fact we risk slipping into normal relationships
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> without specific assurances of
                            concrete progress toward reestablishment of democratic government in
                            Greece. It would be equally foolhardy to break off all contacts when
                            major interests are at stake. We try to walk the tightrope.</p>
                        <p>2. Our contacts with new government have been limited and exploratory. We
                            have reported our conversations with <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName>, Spandidakis, Patakos and <persName corresp="#p_MLCN1">Makarezos</persName>. We expect to make contact
                            with <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> shortly.</p>
                        <p>3. Our impression is that the coup leadership is pro-US, pro-<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, rigorously if not fanatically
                            anti-Communist. It apparently regards itself as revolutionary with a
                            mission of cleansing and reorienting Greek economic, political and
                            social life on new and wholesome basis. We find little evidence it
                            believes its mission can be accomplished within a short period of
                            time.</p>
                        <p>4. Since the coup, information has gradually become available indicating
                            that coup group has existed in some form or other since 1957 under aegis
                            of <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>. Group considered itself as
                            reformist element whose objectives were to seize power and revitalize
                            Greek institutions generally in line with principles which governed
                                <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">IDEA</gloss>. They considered <gloss target="#t_IDEA1">IDEA</gloss>, however, to have lost its dynamism.
                            According to reports, <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> has long been
                            known as “Nasser” to some of his colleagues because of his intriguing
                            nature and his concept of role which army under leadership of aggressive
                            middle-grade officers could play in modernizing the Greek society.</p>
                        <p>5. This junta or revolutionary group is reported to have been comprised
                            of about 40 officers. This group seems to consider King useful symbol
                            with which it will cooperate but is unlikely to subject itself to his
                            control. Although vast preponderance of Greek officers are probably
                            genuinely loyal to King, coup leadership has moved swiftly to retire a
                            number of senior officers. They have successfully established their
                            members in many key commands and have exploited the natural tendency for
                            the mass of the officer corps to be responsive to command channels. Army
                            promotions to be made in next week or two will provide important <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0638"/>evidence as to whether
                            traditional hierarchy has regained measure of control or whether
                            partisans of coup managers will be advanced to key positions without
                            regard to seniority and fitness.</p>
                        <p>6. Our contact has been too limited to form a valid conclusion as yet
                            whether this leadership will be prepared to divest itself voluntarily of
                            the responsibilities of government in foreseeable future. Some observers
                            believe <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and perhaps other officers
                            will eventually leave army and form new political party. However and
                            whenever current phase terminates, Greek political life in future will
                            be vastly changed in structure and personalities.</p>
                        <p>7. We are concerned about internal political implications of current
                            situation and its impact on long term US position here even though coup
                            was in fact greeted with certain amount of initial satisfaction by an
                            undetermined portion of population disgusted with protracted political
                            instability and low public morality.</p>
                        <p>8. It is difficult predict how much time may elapse before leftist and
                            militantly democratic elements of population recover from shock and
                            reaction sets in. Tenor of broadcasts from bloc radios suggests
                            Communists may consider that coup provides them unexpected opportunity
                            to enhance their position in Greece. A large number of Greeks believe
                            United States concurred in or tolerated coup. Many Greeks assert only
                            Communists dispose of an organization capable of leading resistance
                            against a dictatorship and warn that Communists must not again be
                            permitted to become leaders of democratic resistance as in World War II.
                            We accept essential validity of these latter points although it is
                            difficult to weigh precise force in current situation.</p>
                        <p>9. We recognize, nevertheless, that almost any kind of government which
                            could be created at this time would depend ultimately on Greek military
                            for support and that consequently we must seek accommodation with them.
                            Moreover, we are sensitive to fact that split in Greek armed forces
                            (with possibility of actual conflict) would be extremely dangerous for
                            Greece and for US position here. Although Greek armed forces are
                            ostensibly solidly behind new government, there is probably growing
                            number of officers who are aware that King did not in fact initially
                            concur in coup and who privately feel character of coup (extensive
                            suspension of civil liberties, seizure of control by middle-grade
                            officers etc.) has not in fact produced type of solution to political
                            crisis which they may have hoped for. Such sentiments, if confirmed,
                            might exercise important moderating influence on policies of coup
                            managers.</p>
                        <p>10. In these circumstances I believe we must attempt create situation in
                            which coup managers will feel compelled by their own personal interests
                            to give precise assurances and take concrete actions to implement
                            program aimed at restoration constitutional government. These interests
                            include <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> expectation of continuing
                            foreign assistance of varying <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0639"/>sorts (military, development credits, etc.) as well as general foreign
                            and domestic reputation of the regime and support for it.</p>
                        <p>11. With no early alternative to present regime in sight, problem is how
                            to achieve the sort of turn around to civil rule that ultimately
                            followed the Turkish military coup of 1960. This would involve a <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> commitment to constitution-drafting to
                            create some sort of government based on consent of governed. It should
                            include progressive restoration civil liberties, establishment of
                            committee of jurists to revise Constitution, plebiscite on
                            constitutional revisions, encouragement to coup leaders to yield office
                            to qualified civilians, elections within specified time frame, etc. Dept
                            will have noted <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> reports indicating

                        <p>12. It is to these ends that Embassy is pointing its efforts.
                            Specifically:</p>
                        <p>(A) I propose to continue urging King to maintain a position vis-à-vis
                            the government that would clearly reflect his reserve but without
                            ostensible hostility. Last week our immediate goal was to save King for
                            some useful future role. Yesterday we discussed this role as well as
                            steps he might take to overcome growing impression he may have come into
                            full accord with coup group.</p>
                        <p>(B) We propose maintain only limited contacts with government and coup
                            leaders and continue to emphasize that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot easily carry forward programs with Greece until
                            constitutional situation clarified. Yesterday we spelled out to Admiral
                            Avgheris, <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Gouras and King that
                            delivery main important types of military equipment has been suspended
                            pending review of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and that concrete
                            evidence that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> sincerely moving
                            restore constitutional government would greatly aid USG resume program
                            on previously established basis.</p>
                        <p>(C) We probing <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> economic policies
                            also. In view of adverse balance of payments prospects (Athens
                                5066)<note n="4" xml:id="d284fn4">Dated May 3. (Ibid.)</note> I
                            anticipate upcoming requests for help at least in supporting Greek
                            applications to international lending institutions. These will give
                            further opportunities to point to moral.</p>
                        <pb n="602" xml:id="pg_602" facs="0640"/>
                        <p>(D) Washington could support this approach in several ways. For example,
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should continue to emphasize in
                            its public statements that it is awaiting concrete steps toward
                            reestablishment of democratic government. I recommend that in near
                            future President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> make
                            statement roughly along lines of that made by Secretary. Secretary's
                            statement was briefly alluded to, but not quoted, in only one Athens
                            newspaper and ignored in others.<note n="5" xml:id="d284fn5">For text of

                            could usefully call in Greek Ambassador and set forth importance which
                            we attach to return of democratic government as a condition for full and
                            intimate cooperation with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>(E) I hope you and I can keep in closest communication on question of
                            resuming delivery of major items of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            equipment. In general, they should not be delivered until we are
                            satisfied with programs developed by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            for return to representative government. We in Embassy will make sure
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> understands this. As you know,
                            however, I am anxious that we not get into bureaucratic bind that would
                            impede <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> shipments when conditions are
                            right. There is a fine line between using <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries to press for constructive policies and
                            dismantling keystone of our mutual security cooperation with Greece. We
                            weathered military coup in Turkey without damage to our strategic
                            interests. We must have same objective in Greece.</p>
                        <p>(F) If Department finds above lines acceptable, we should consult with
                            other Western powers, particularly <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and
                            Germany, with a view to having them adopt a posture similar to ours.</p>
                        <p>13. I believe it would be premature for us to take initiative with regard
                            to Cyprus problem at this time. Gouras and Caglayangil had 90-minute
                            talk at Bonn and presumably will go on from there. We can add little
                            until our own relations with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> are
                            worked out. There are, however, intimations Cyprus occupies very
                            important place among preoccupations this government.</p>
                        <p>14. Initially we must speak candidly in private while in public making
                            clear not only expectation as to line <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will follow but also our confidence that they intend to
                            follow such a course. Leaders of this coup are doubtless very sensitive
                            having risked greatly and won handsomely in first phase of their
                            program. Presumably they are also dedicated men. Although politically
                            relatively unsophisticated, they also are probably convinced they are
                            acting not only in interest of Greece but of West and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>.</p>

                                reported that Margaret Papandreou was concerned that her husband's
                                captors were “brainwashing” him through the use of dangerous drugs.
                                (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. During my call on King Thursday evening I told him in confidence of
                            Mrs. Papandreou's assertion that her husband is being administered drugs
                            and of her description of medical history of Andreas and attendant
                            dangers of any regime of drugs. He could anticipate consequences if
                            Andreas' health should suddenly deteriorate while in detention. Even at
                            propaganda level, it could do Greece no good if drug charges should be
                            aired abroad and some international committee be formed to examine his
                            condition.</p>
                        <p>2. King said he had heard nothing that indicated Andreas had any health
                            difficulties. Cy Sulzberger, who had seen him last Saturday, had
                            described Andreas as in normal health and in good spirits.<note n="3" xml:id="d285fn3">For Sulzberger's account of his meeting with

                                331–333.</note> However, King thought he could emphasize to Patakos great
                            importance of avoiding any chance that political prisoners would lose
                            their health and vitality while in detention. If his probing should pick
                            up any indication of drug administration, he would be in position to
                            pursue question in detail.</p>

                            memcon, still subject to clearance with SecDef:</p>
                        <p>1. Minister of Defense Spandidakis, accompanied by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> and an interpreter, called on
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> in his <gloss target="#t_USRO1">USRO</gloss> office at 1630 immediately following
                            conclusion of the Defense Ministers meeting. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CH1">Cleveland</persName> and Assistant Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNJT1">McNaughton</persName> were present.
                            Spandidakis initiated the conversation by saying he assumed <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> wanted to know why the
                            military acted in Greece. He then talked through the interpreter for 15
                            minutes.</p>
                        <p>2. He said that from 1964 things had been deteriorating in Greece, that
                            the political parties had been corrupted, that there were a number of
                            liaisons with the Communists, and that there was a Communist build-up
                            everywhere including the army. It was clear the country was going to
                            fall in Communist hands, so the army, to prevent this, took over on
                            April 21 despite the Constitution. Spandidakis referred at this point to
                            the need to prevent a return to guerrilla warfare (“another Vietnam”) in
                            Greece. He said the ease with which the revolution was carried off in a
                            few hours proves it was accepted by the Greek people. He said there were
                            no “victims” (he would not count as victims the two people who were
                            killed in violating the curfew). He pointed out that peace reigned in
                            Greece two days after the action. He said the population, except for a
                            Communist small (12–15 percent) minority, accepts the action.</p>
                        <p>3. Spandidakis said the attacks on the Greek action are mainly from
                            foreign countries, by Communist governments or by groups associated with
                            the Communists. He referred also to false rumors such as the alleged
                            kidnapping of the King's daughter to put pressure on the King, and the
                            rumors about the regime's intentions to execute <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> and Communist leader
                            Glazes. But he said the “greatest bitterness is in the rumor that the US
                            would revise its assistance to Greece.” He said this made no sense
                            because the alternative was to surrender to Communism. He said that, as
                            it is, the ties between Greece and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            are stronger now than before.</p>
                        <p>4. He said it is true that some people have been detained, including
                            George Papandreou—who, he says, is now being treated better than he <pb n="605" xml:id="pg_605" facs="0643"/>would be in his own house. He
                            referred to others being kept in hotels, in comfortable circumstances as
                            the press could see for itself. He said such detentions were necessary
                            to stop their stirring up trouble.</p>
                        <p>5. Spandidakis said the government had a four-point program: (1) to
                            reorganize the government mechanism, (2) to establish economic control,
                            (3) to revise the Constitution to “bring it up to date”, and (4) to
                            “return the country to a constitutional order.” He said no one knows how
                            long the program would take, that it depends on the depth of the
                            preexisting disorganization. He said, “All of us are of a democratic
                            point of view; we are not going to establish a Fascist regime in
                            Greece”. He added that today there is no Parliament but, except for
                            that, there is more democracy today than before April 21; he said they
                            had anarchy at that time. He pointed to the interest taken by the new
                            government in the farmers and low income groups, who have expressed
                            their appreciation.</p>
                        <p>6. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he was
                            grateful for the explanation and for Spandidakis' frankness (which
                            frankness, together with sincerity, Spandidakis had emphasized on three
                            occasions). <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he
                            would likewise be frank. He said it was unnecessary to tell a Greek of
                            the admiration that the American people have for the Greek people: we
                            have had a very close relationship with them over the past two decades;
                            and our civilization is based upon theirs, dating back 2500 years. He
                            said it is completely natural for our young people to expect to travel
                            in Greece; indeed, his daughter had spent the last year there and is
                            still there. He said it concerns us greatly that Greece has moved away
                            from constitutional processes.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said it would be
                            unbecoming of him to comment on Greek internal affairs, but that it was
                            not inappropriate for him to comment on US internal affairs. He then
                            said that the American people could never understand a statement that
                            there is more democracy today than before April 21—with the press
                            suppressed, assembly prevented, people restrained, no free speech, and
                            other constitutional guarantees suspended. Also, important to the view
                            by the American people was the absence of any schedule for resumption of
                            constitutional processes. These, he said, are strong feelings of most of
                            the people in the US, and he and other government officials are servants
                            of the people. He said it would be extraordinarily difficult to maintain
                            the Greek military assist-ance program without modification if there is
                            no acceptable time schedule for the resumption of constitutional
                            processes.</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that he believed
                            Spandidakis' statement that he opposed a Fascist government, but that
                            the American view would be greatly affected by the degree to which the
                            Greeks indicate (a) a desire to make the change, (b) a schedule for the
                            change, and (c) actions toward the change. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said the US would be willing to try to
                            help—e.g., by avoiding any public denunciation. But he said, the Greeks
                            should not <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0644"/>underestimate the
                            concern of the US and the strong hopes for movement back toward
                            constitutional processes.</p>
                        <p>9. Spandidakis at this point said, “Then you must explain the facts to
                            the American people”. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>
                            responded that, unfortunately, the facts seemed to be as stated
                            earlier—people detained, constitutional processes suspended, etc. He
                            said that the US looks to the future with hope along the lines he had
                            described.</p>
                        <p>10. Spandidakis said that a revision of the Military Assistance Program
                            would be dangerous, spelling out the Greek reliance on US aid. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that the whole Greek
                            situation is dangerous, and that, until action is taken to remedy it,
                            the dangerous situation will continue. He hoped the Greeks could see a
                            path for return to constitutional government which would make progress
                            in that direction obvious to outsiders. He added his view that the
                            greatest deterrent to the Soviets and the thing most likely to encourage
                            support from the US would be a demonstration by the Greeks that they can
                            return to constitutional processes.</p>
                        <p>11. Spandidakis said that continuation of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> will shorten the time required. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> answered that, as Greek plans
                            along the lines he had described became firmer, we can be informed of
                            the progress, and public support for <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            in our country will grow.</p>
                        <p>12. Spandidakis asked what if the election had taken place and Greece had
                            gone Communist. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said he
                            would not speculate but did not believe Greece would vote the Communists
                            into power. After Spandidakis explained that only 12–15 percent of the
                            population are Communist, but that more than 50 percent of the people
                            were going to make the mistake of following them, <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> said that the political parties
                            had been behaving in such a way as to let the Communists take over.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> repeated that the
                            important thing was to lay out a course of action to return to the
                            constitutional processes.</p>
                        <p>13. The conversation was concluded at 1720 with a short exchange on
                            reliability of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> as an ally of
                            Greece in trouble—both Spandidakis and <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> suggesting that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> was in such disarray that it could not be counted on
                            to come to Greece's aid. <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> said that, in his view, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> is in much better condition today
                            than it was a year ago, pointing to a year of “tremendous
                            accomplishment” in both the political and military sense, pointing to
                            the way the Allies had successfully survived the French withdrawal and
                            eviction, and to the birth and apparent good start of the NPG. He added
                            that we need (and will, in his view, be doing) more <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> planning in support of defensive
                            actions on the flanks.</p>

                        <p>2. These comments confirm our impression that new regime leaders have

                            familiarizing themselves with numerous domestic problems that they have

                        <p>1. Your excellent telegrams over weekend have been read carefully here.
                            Dept deeply appreciative your thoughtful analysis.</p>
                        <p>2. We agree that our approach to new Greek Govt must be to walk tightrope
                            and that problem is essentially how to show people in Greece and
                            elsewhere that U.S. (and King) not attached to new govt, while at same
                            time working with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to get Greece back
                            on constitutional road. As you state, our chief effort now must be to
                            create situation in which coup managers will feel compelled by their own
                            personal interests to give precise assurances and take concrete actions
                            towards restoration of constitutional govt.</p>
                        <p>3. As we see it, major problem of next few days and weeks is to convince
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that it must take specific,
                            concrete steps to demonstrate to world that it sincerely plans to return
                            to constitutional govt. As you have pointed out to King, vague
                            assurances of good intentions will not suffice. Govt plan to appoint
                            committee of eminent jurists to revise constitution, as announced by
                            Pattakos, is step in right direction but, as <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> emphasized to <persName corresp="#p_MLCN1">Makarezos</persName>, to be fully effective must be accompanied by
                            announcement of dates when revision will be completed and when
                            plebiscite will be held to approve final document. Your suggestion that
                            King use occasion of birth his child to announce timetable for return to
                            constitutional rule is excellent one and you should encourage King to
                            attempt obtain GOG approval such move. Also important will be nature of
                            persons appointed to revision committee. Ideally, they should be persons
                            of international stature; in this connection, govt may wish consider
                            appointment of some eminent foreign jurists to such committee.</p>
                        <p>4. We are somewhat encouraged by your description King's policy of
                            cooperating with new govt at same time retaining image of separateness
                            from them. We also feel his effort to encourage senior officers of known
                            loyalty to reconsolidate their command authority is wise move and could
                            be crucial factor at later stage. You should continue to encourage King
                            to apply pressure on new govt by selective non-attendance at certain
                            functions (as described to you in <gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 5135) and we share your view that Embassy should
                            follow King's lead and thus indicate clearly to coup managers our
                            support for King's efforts.</p>
                        <p>5. In addition to positive steps by govt we wish to encourage, we should
                            also use our influence with King and <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> to discourage further repressive measures by
                            govt, such as establishment special military courts, abolition political
                            organizations, and recently announced elimination of municipal
                            elections. New govt has real public relations problem which could be
                            alleviated somewhat by more restraint by coup managers in public
                            announcements.</p>
                        <p>6. Most urgent question as far as American and international public
                            opinion is concerned remains, of course, fate of political prisoners and
                            particularly of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                            Papandreou</persName>. We fully aware of deep opposition <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0647"/>on part of coup managers to release at
                            this time of <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>
                            and other political prisoners. However, you should continue to impress
                            upon them at every opportunity fact that to large extent world image of
                            new govt will be based on its handling of prisoners' question and trial
                            of Andreas.</p>
                        <p>7. As occasions arise where such action can serve useful purpose, we plan

                                Greece 3 weeks after the coup. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Reftel conveys Country Team impressions of situation here three weeks
                            after coup. To these let me add some personal thoughts as you face new
                            rounds on Hill.</p>
                        <p>(a) Rather astonishing extent of acquiescence to coup can no longer be
                            explained just as stunned reaction. Mood of relief has osmotically
                            spread through community. As when power suddenly fails in boiler
                            factory, only in this unexpected moment of quiet are many people
                            realizing how much strain they had felt in normal high-decibel political
                            din. Many now admit, too, to having feared destructiveness of impending
                            electoral clashes. I'm reminded of Pakistan in 1958, when first reaction
                            to Ayub's coup was also sheer relief. This is a real phenomenon, not a
                            shibboleth.</p>
                        <p>(b) How long this mood will last, we don't know, certainly not
                            indefinitely. Greeks are Greeks and will come to resist. But while it
                            does, it has two major consequences: (1) it gives coup group almost
                            ideal climate in which to consolidate control, and (2) it insulates many
                            Greeks from <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0648"/>impact of European
                            and American outcry against “rape in cradle of democracy”. I am
                            surprised at how widely we are getting rejoinders that Americans should
                            understand it was Papandreous, especially Andreas, who strangled
                            democracy here.</p>
                        <p>(c) This all heading, I fear, into major breakdown of genuine
                            communication between important segments of opinion in Greece and in US.
                            It is not merely matter of American disbelief of Greek feelings of
                            relief at recent developments or of Greek wonderment at American
                            lionizing of Andreas. More basic is fact that Americans and Europeans
                            think Greece is clothed in Athenian values, while Greeks themselves
                            remember how often in past 3,000 years—and in past 145 years since
                            independence—they have been shuttlecocked between Athenian and Spartan
                            concepts of government. Veterans in this century of seven wars, five
                            military coups and at least two other attempts, one Royal assassination
                            and three Royal withdrawals, at least three dictators, and more than 20
                            parliamentary governments since 1950, five of them in past 21 months,
                            modern Greeks have enjoyed stable parliamentary rule really only between
                            1952 and 1965 (Papagos-<persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>-Papandreou). Thus I encounter reactions of
                            “Well, here we go again. Wonder what it will be like this time. Hope it
                            won't be too bad; at least they've been rather soft to start with—no
                            killings or anything like that”. This is very different attitude from
                            outrage at rape of democracy, and perhaps more in keeping with cynical
                            ennui of Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                        <p>(d) Defining this attitude doesn't solve our problem, nor does it suggest
                            that present nonparliamentary regime will remain popular; far from it.
                            But it does suggest that when volatile Greeks as usual look for some
                            other path after some time, we should try to be ready to encourage and
                            help them on realistic basis that neither they nor we want Greece soon
                            to sink back into parliamentary tumult characteristic of pre-1952 period
                            and of recent past.</p>
                        <p>(e) How to do this? Just pressing <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to
                            set precise dates for plebiscite and elections will not be enough, I
                            fear. Based on previous Greek experience with plebiscite promises, date
                            setting would not necessarily assure early return to representative
                            government. In any event, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has proven
                            resistant to our advice not only because military Ministers have already
                            come to enjoy power but also because they seem to have persuaded
                            themselves that setting early date (only kind they think would interest
                            us) would inhibit their carrying through essential reforms. Despised
                            politicians, they believe, would then merely hole-in and await time they
                            could regain control of moneybags and patronage. And the one thing these
                            military Ministers are determined not to do is to turn country back to
                            same old hacks they stole it from.</p>
                        <p>(f) If <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and company are to be diverted
                            from road Nasser took after deciding Wafd could never again be trusted
                            to govern <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611" facs="0649"/>Egypt, therefore,
                            Greeks and we need to concentrate on how to get parliamentary democracy
                            that avoids anarchy. Several Greeks, including <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>, have long been thinking about
                            this. Ideas we could feed in from experience in other countries
                            (requested in Athens 5000)<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">See <ref target="#d284fn3">footnote 3, Document 284</ref>.</note> would
                            be helpful.</p>
                        <p>(g) In long run, I doubt we could cooperate efficiently with a
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>-dominated <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. Frontal effort to break him now would, however, be
                            without guarantee of success and if successful could well shatter
                            Greece. Task as I see it is to try to restrain him and his coup
                            associates from excesses, wrap more talent and disciplined organization
                            around them, and keep pushing in direction of a constitutionalism that
                            will work. Meanwhile, I believe we should continue supporting King and
                            stay as much as possible in posture of neither giving Greeks what they
                            most want—full aid and recognition—nor coming to definitive break.</p>
                        <p>2. I am not so presumptuous as to think all this will be useful to you,
                            but writing it has helped me clarify my own thoughts. Good luck in
                            arduous chores you face.</p>

                        <p>Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>You will have seen Marquis Childs' story (Tab A)<note n="2" xml:id="d290fn2">The May 15 article was entitled “A Coup in Greece;
                                A Bit of Blackmail.”</note> in this morning's <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> on our alleged involvement in the Greek
                            coup.</p>
                        <p>The story is about as inaccurate as it could be.</p>
                        <p>The facts are these:</p>
                        <p>—On March 8 and 13, 1967, the 303 Committee considered a proposal that
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] put $200–$300,000 <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0650"/>into the Greek elections which were then scheduled to
                            back candidates who would be anti-Andreas. Although, as indicated in the
                            attached minutes (Tab B),<note n="3" xml:id="d290fn3">See <ref target="#d259">Documents 259</ref> and <ref target="#d261">261</ref>.</note> we all felt considerable reservation about
                            the proposal, we examined it carefully because the Ambassador
                            recommended it. We finally decided that <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Foy
                                Kohler</persName> should take the matter up with Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>, and if the Secretary felt the
                            proposal was vital, I would raise the matter with you. On March 14,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KFD1">Kohler</persName> reported as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“He (Sect. <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>) comes down
                            negative. In the Greek case, he believes the possible political gain is
                            outweighed by the security risks. He commented that if the dual-national
                            Greek-Americans are concerned about the prospects and if $200–$300,000
                            will make the difference, they should have no trouble raising that sum
                            themselves without involving the United States Government.”</p>
                        <p>In general, the view we took was that it was becoming less and less
                            appropriate for us to try to influence elections in places like
                                Italy<note n="4" xml:id="d290fn4">For documentation on Italy, see

                                of source text not declassified</hi>]. Moreover, there was
                            considerable skepticism—shared by me—that the outcome in Greece would be
                            much affected by this kind of money.</p>
                        <p>In any case, the issue before us was not ‘what should we do or not do
                            about a coup’: it was, ‘what should we do or not do about an election
                            which at that time we all believed was more likely, rather than less
                            likely, to take place’; although we knew there was considerable anxiety
                            in certain Greek quarters about that election.</p>
                        <p>I have already asked State to undertake an investigation of who might
                            have spoken about this matter to Marquis Childs. The problem in tracking
                            down this particular inaccurate and distorted leak is that, because
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> came in with a

                        <p>5377. NATUS.</p>
                        <p>1. In my first discussion with him since April 26, Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> Friday revealed <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>'s sensitivity to official American view
                            of situation in Greece. Our exchange started with some rather starchy
                            references by <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> to United
                            States “misunderstanding” of Greek military action to save Greece. After
                            my assertion that our biggest question is what direction new <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will take, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> concluded with assurance that formation and
                            operation of constitution-revising committee will proceed promptly. On
                            the whole, I believe exercise was useful.</p>
                        <p>2. At first <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> was edgy and
                            visibly upset by what I gather was well-embellished telegram from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MAA1">Matsas</persName> describing talk
                            with Secretary May 17.<note n="2" xml:id="d291fn2">Telegram 196553 to

                                prisoners and political repression by the Junta. (Ibid., POL 23–9
                                GREECE)</note> Greeks, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName>
                            said, are “very sorry” and he feels “great bitterness” because American
                            friends do not seem to realize great necessity for change and continue
                            unfavorable criticism on top of which they also cut military assistance.
                            Greeks many times have shown they can live on cats and mice rather than
                            betray ideal in which they believe. Greece even if left in lurch by its
                            allies will continue to fight for real democracy and continue to love
                            Americans and be grateful for support they have given since 1947. Greeks
                            understand liberty and they understand need to overcome corruption of
                            recent parliamentary process in order to restore true liberty to their
                            country. He himself had starved and fought as simple soldier in cause of
                            liberty and had now given up judicial career of forty years to assist in
                            service of his country. He would never agree to serve a cause whose
                            purpose was imposition of a dictatorial regime. Rather this government's
                            purpose is to establish real freedom and democracy in order to save
                            country from chaos and catastrophe that was about to befall it.
                            Revolution of April 21 was perhaps most civilized, most liberal and most
                            bloodless revolution ever to occur. All information government has
                            received from interior of country is extremely satisfactory. Eighty per
                            cent of people share enthusiasm for change.</p>
                        <p>3. After twenty minutes of similar oratory I managed to riposte that
                            having listened with close attention I was greatly disappointed to
                            realize <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0652"/>that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> apparently had not understood major
                            points <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> has been seeking to make. We
                            have our views on what has occurred before April 21 and thereafter.
                            American people had not believed recent conditions in Greece ideal, but
                            it would be unrealistic to think Americans would not have reacted to
                            what has happened.</p>
                        <p>4. Events of April 21 raised questions which need sorting out before
                            future U.S. road can be determined. Thus the military assistance review
                            (whose details I spelled out to correct his assertion that aid had been
                            cut off but also to leave him in no doubt that review could ultimately
                            be concluded in any of several directions). However, I went on, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is not concentrating on the past; it is
                            not suggesting that clock could be turned back. Rather, it is looking to
                            present and future. What direction is this government going to take? If
                            it is to move along lines of military governments fastened on some Arab
                            countries, for example, Americans could be expected to react. (“No, no,”
                            Kollias objected.) If on other hand this government pursues objective of
                            restoring representative government as quickly as possible, we could
                            expect American policies to move in another direction. Problem is one of
                            being convincing. As Prime Minister aware, announcement of plan to form
                            constitution-revision committee and submit its product to plebiscite
                            after review by government was favorable step. Yet that simple
                            declaration not enough to persuade international opinion in face of
                            other things that have happened in Greece.</p>
                        <p>5. We know, I continued, that Greeks can fight their battles, alone if
                            necessary. But we do not want to see <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            isolated from world. We have been privileged to be closely associated
                            with Greeks in their struggles, especially in past twenty years. That is
                            why we are so much interested in persuasive evidence that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will indeed move briskly toward
                            constitution revision and representative rule.</p>
                        <p>6. Speaking personally, I told Prime Minister that my colleagues in
                            Washington had made great efforts to persuade influential Congressmen
                            and others not to heat up American reaction before receiving firm
                            evidence of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> intentions. This was a
                            difficult exercise, and I did not know how much longer it could be
                            carried on. Assurances given now by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            could be much more helpful in calming international opinion than same
                            assurances given after some weeks when adverse attitudes may have
                            grown.</p>
                        <p>7. With his adrenaline still running, though less vigorously than at
                            first, <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> declared that it is
                            and has always been the desire of this <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to have country return to normal political life as soon
                            as conditions will permit. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> said so
                            in its initial proclamation to the people, and has since repeated its
                            pledge. Prime Minister could categorically assure me that names of
                            twenty members of committee which will be charged with revision of
                            Constitution will be announced by end of this month. Committee <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0653"/>will be given up to six months
                            to prepare revision and after study by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> this will be submitted to plebiscite. He could also
                            assure me that with help of God and with aid (unspecified), government
                            would be in position within one year to proclaim elections. He made it
                            clear, however, that without aid <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            would not be in position to establish conditions that would make
                            elections possible within this time.</p>
                        <p>8. I commented that public statement along lines he had just set out to
                            me would in my opinion have beneficial effect. He said he could make
                            announcement about constitution-revising committee members' appointment
                            without delay, but that talk about elections would be different matter
                            since that would depend not only on <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.

                        <p>Dear Dan:</p>
                        <p>In view of the distribution given even <gloss target="#t_Exdis1">Exdis</gloss> telegrams, I would prefer for some time to report to
                            you by letter some of the more sensitive items that emerge from my
                            conversations with the King. This will give you direct control of
                            distribution of this sort of information in Washington—a control that I
                            believe to be essential in these circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the King described further steps in his thinking about how to
                            meet a confrontation with Col. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and the
                            Revolutionary Council, should one occur.<note n="2" xml:id="d292fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> reported on his May 25
                                conversation with King Constantine in telegram 5466 from Athens, May
                                26. (Ibid., Central Files, POL 15–1 GREECE)</note> His visits to
                            military units scheduled for June will, he hopes, give him a chance to
                            test the loyalty and discipline of units to which he might want to turn.
                            He thinks that the 20th Armored Division (General <persName corresp="#p_EBGA1">Erselman</persName>) and other Third Corps
                            elements along the <pb n="616" xml:id="pg_616" facs="0654"/>Evros River
                            (Gen. Zalocoris) might provide him a welcome in case of need. His
                            tentative idea in the event of a confrontation would be to get his
                            family out of the country and then make every effort to get to the north
                            by plane or ship (presumably Royal Hellenic Navy ship) in order to base
                            himself with loyal units, broadcast to the nation, and announce that he
                            was moving south toward Athens to reassert his command over the Armed
                            Forces and his headship of the nation. The success of such a plea, he
                            feels, would depend in part on the loyalty of the Greek Armed Forces,
                            but very substantially also on United States actions. He would hope that
                            we could work out a plan between now and early June which I could then
                            discuss in Washington. He continues to think how fine it would be if the
                            Sixth Fleet could be in the area at the time of confrontation. Its mere
                            presence would probably turn the tide, in his view. He hopes that he and
                            I could also talk, however, about the possible availability of Marines
                            to come ashore peacefully as in Lebanon in 1958, should the need arise.
                            I immediately cautioned him against expectation of any involvement of
                            U.S. forces. It is a long time since 1958, conditions are different, and
                            any such action could be taken only on the express instructions of the
                            highest levels in Washington. I would not want him to draw false
                            encouragement from anything I might either say or not say in response to
                            his comments. He said he understood this but that “we should think of
                            some plan before you go to Washington, so that you can discuss it there
                            in detail.”</p>
                        <p>This is the King's second foray with me on the question of his own
                            contingency plans if it should become impossible to carry on with the
                            present government. Presumably he will raise it again when I see him
                            sometime in the first week of June. We are working on some thoughts
                            here, which I hope to get to you promptly, but I will urgently need the
                            Department's instructions and guidance in coping with further stages of
                            development of the King's ideas.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. While we consider appointment of committee to revise Greek
                            constitution as positive step towards eventual return to constitutional
                            processes, we are nonetheless disturbed by other steps taken by new
                            government, as well as by comment by Min
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and press organs close to him,
                            which appear to indicate that govt. does not intend to return to
                            parliamentarianism in near future. We recognize that somewhat
                            contradictory developments may represent split within coup leadership as
                            to ultimate aim of April 21 “revolution.” Therefore, as part of
                            continuing U.S pressure towards return to parliamentary government, as
                            well as to encourage those elements within govt. supporting return to
                            constitutional processes, we recommend that you call on PriMin <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> at early opportunity to set
                            forth following points:</p>
                        <p>(a) U.S. is encouraged by May 30 announcement of appointment of 20-member
                            committee which will revise constitution and submit it to govt. within
                            six months. This step is consistent with earlier statements by King and
                            govt. leaders of an intention to return to constitutional processes, and
                            we hope that it will soon be followed by announcement of date completed
                            document will be presented to Greek people for approval.</p>
                        <p>(b) However, we are disturbed by certain other developments which seem to
                            suggest a step-up in repressive measures. Among these is arrest of
                            additional non-Communist politicians, including John Tsouderos, as well
                            as delay in release of several thousand political prisoners, as earlier
                            promised in govt. statements. We are also concerned by statements in
                            newspapers reflecting govt. opinion that return to parliamentary
                            democracy will be far in the future, as well as by articles in such
                            papers seemingly aimed at discrediting parliamentarianism. Also
                            disquieting is <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> statement that
                            “termination of life of revolution before it fulfills its tasks would be
                            act of highest treason both to nation and to people (Athens 5509).</p>
                        <p>(c) Degree to which new govt. moves (or does not move) towards
                            restoration democratic institutions is closely followed by American
                            public <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0656"/>and Congress. (U.S.
                            press and public concern at recent developments in Greece is illustrated
                            by May 30 <hi rend="italic">NYTimes</hi> editorial “Backsliding in
                            Greece.”) Possibility of returning to normal Greek-U.S. relations,
                            including resumption of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>, will be
                            directly influenced by new govt.'s progress in returning to
                            constitutional processes and its handling of political prisoners. To
                            extent govt. steps up repressive measures it lessens chances of early
                            return to normal relations.</p>
                        <p>2. You may wish to draw on above in discussions with other key govt.

                        <p>2. Gouras said that he brought good news re Greek internal situation. New
                            government being supported by people. Examples were attendance at
                            ceremonies in Piraeus municipal theater and Athens stadium. Gouras had
                            thought first might have been arranged but was certain enthusiastic
                            stadium crowd spontaneous.</p>

                        <p>3. Foreign Minister recalled he had discussed with Secretary at
                            Luxembourg <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> plans to return to
                            constitutional situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d294fn3">No memorandum of
                                conversation has been found, but Secto 19 from Luxembourg, June 14,
                                forwarded the text of a Greek paper on the return to constitutional
                                government. (Ibid., Conference Files: Lot 68 D 453, CF 191)</note>
                            He happy reaffirm <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will keep this
                            promise perhaps in an even shorter time frame, a year and a half or two
                            years at latest. He hoped constitutional committee would have finished
                            work before end of year. Gouras explained previous constitution did not
                            have moral support of people since it permitted abuses by political
                            parties. New one will imitate U.S. constitution in that members of
                            government will not be permitted at same time be members of Parliament.
                            Number of deputies will be cut from 300 to 150. Not yet decided whether
                            will be one chamber or two.</p>
                        <p>4. Gouras alleged Greek financial situation encouraging. Savings in banks
                            and post office accounts last month up 18% over corresponding month
                            1966.</p>
                        <p>5. Secretary suggested one or two members of committee considering
                            revision constitution come to U.S. to talk about how provisions of U.S.
                            constitution work; drafters of constitution thought weak executive
                            better than a strong one and result their work is that carrying on
                            business of government requires lots of time and willingness to
                            cooperate between branches thereof; implications of this should be
                            carefully studied. Secretary also suggested that committee make public
                            statements from time to time to show that effort a serious one which
                            making real progress. He thought this would be helpful in counteracting
                            impression that work of revising constitution only window dressing.</p>
                        <p>6. Foreign Minister said change in Greece was not simple military coup
                            designed merely to change a government but was true revolution similar
                            to that which occurred in 1909 when elder <persName corresp="#p_VS1">Venizelos</persName> came from Crete; military members <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> were not ambitious but modest men who
                            would return to barracks after they had achieved a healthy democracy for
                            Greece. Contrasted their attitude with what he described as previous
                            conspiracy between <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> and leftist
                            branch of CU to establish Communist dictatorship in Greece.</p>
                        <p>7. In discussion of time which might elapse between plebiscite on new
                            constitution and elections Gouras said difficult be precise. One problem
                            would be revision of electoral lists, as those who have taken part in
                            conspiracy against Greek values will be deprived of right to vote.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to Secretary's question Gouras said Greek economic
                            situation strong; there was public confidence in government, the drachma
                            had been stabilized, and export-import situation good.</p>
                        <p>9. Foreign Minister complained of “aggressive” campaign being carried out
                            against Greece by Iron Curtain countries. Mentioned his own <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0658"/>past role in bettering relations with
                            Greece's Balkan neighbors. Maintained matter of agreement with
                            Yugoslavia not important and new one would be negotiated.</p>
                        <p>10. In discussing position of King, Gouras said he more popular than
                            ever. Maintained he has accepted revolution and told government he would
                            support it in its task of strengthening Greek democracy. When Secretary
                            inquired who exercises real power in government, Gouras said Prime
                            Minister has very strong position. Military members of course have
                            material power but Prime Minister has decidedly powerful influence over
                            them. Gouras denied rumors of discord between three military
                            members.</p>
                        <p>11. In response Secretary's question re trade unions, Gouras asserted
                            situation all right now. At Geneva meeting ILO Greek representatives
                            gave unsatisfactory explanation. Nonetheless malicious reports re trade
                            union situation continue to be circulated in order influence
                            international opinion against Greece.</p>
                        <p>12. In subsequent private session with Secretary Gouras took up <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>. Said military members <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> might “do something crazy” under
                            pressure <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> exerting by suspending
                            shipments. Secretary said he going before Senate next week at time when
                            latter very upset by whole U.S. arms policy as result India-Pakistan and
                            Arab-Israel wars and Greek coup. Would jeopardize entire Military
                            Assistance Program if, Secretary said with regard to Greek program, more
                            than that situation continuing under study. Thus Secretary could give
                            Gouras no assurances beyond saying policy under continuing review.

                                some action regarding Cyprus. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                POL 27 CYP)</note> Recent radio and press attacks on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and those around him might
                            well have been designed to bring pressure on Archbishop to abandon his
                            position on “genuine enosis” and we now inclined believe GOG will
                            continue pressures on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            to obtain his acquiescence in <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> agreement or his resignation.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> thinking seems to comprise
                            following elements:</p>
                        <p>a. Because of its character, it is better able than democratic Greek
                            Government to make settlement which would meet <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> desiderata. Offer of 60-year lease to Turks suggests
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> may go all the way and offer
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> a sovereign base.</p>
                        <p>b. Settlement perplexing and frustrating Cyprus problem would satisfy
                            nationalistic aspirations most Greeks, and would add to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>'s own internal and international
                            prestige. This government more than most Greek Governments likely view
                            honorable Greek settlement, i.e., some form enosis, as essential.</p>
                        <p>c. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and some of those
                            around him either are not prepared to accept form of enosis which would
                            satisfy <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, but may even prefer
                            continued independence. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> concerned
                            about growth of anti-enosis sentiment being encouraged on island.</p>
                        <p>d. Existence of crypto-communist <gloss target="#t_AKEL1">AKEL</gloss>
                            and its satellite organizations on island is threat to Hellenism as a
                            whole. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> also clearly concerned <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0660"/>about Lyssarides and his
                            influence on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, and about
                                <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and others who have
                            vested interest in continuing independence of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>3. We assume essential element in any <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            planning would be prior agreement with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, possibly in some detail. Thus far there no indication
                            any such agreement reached. In fact, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_EGP1">Economou</persName>-Gouras, now in US, has
                            informed us<note n="4" xml:id="d295fn4">See <ref target="#d294">Document
                                    294</ref>.</note> that in recent talks with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil he still
                            attempting to prevail upon Turks to accept long lease on Cyprus base,
                            whereas <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> insistent on sovereign base
                            area. In this connection, of course, it possible Gouras not privy to
                            thinking of Athens coup group which may be willing transfer sovereign
                            base area.</p>
                        <p>4. If <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> thinking along these lines,
                            sequence events envisaged may be something along following pattern
                            (though not necessarily in that order):</p>
                        <p>a. Secret agreement with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, providing
                            for (1) Turkish possession of a sovereign base area in Cyprus, either at
                            Dhekelia, or Karpas Peninsula (but presumably the former), and (2)
                            stipulated guarantees of communal rights of Turkish Cypriot
                            minority.</p>
                        <p>b. Neutralization, using Greek military units on Cyprus as necessary, of
                            Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, other Greek
                            Cypriot leaders not clearly in favor of enosis, and, of course,
                            Communists (<gloss target="#t_AKEL1">AKEL</gloss>) and others of
                            left-wing persuasion. Such neutralization would accord with
                            self-proclaimed objectives of current Greek leadership, and recent
                            official statements from Athens would seem to pave the way towards, or
                            foreshadow, some such action.</p>
                        <p>c. Placing in positions of power in Cyprus of Greek Cypriot elements in
                            confidence of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>d. Announcement, possibly in collaboration with <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, of some form of union between Cyprus and Greece. This
                            might take form of Commonwealth relationship, with King Constantine
                            acting as sovereign of Cyprus, GOG assuming responsibilities for foreign
                            affairs, defense, and perhaps also internal security, and, for the rest,
                            internal self-government for Cyprus including careful delineation of
                            role and privileges of Turkish minority.</p>
                        <p>5. Depending upon kind of action <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> may
                            take, we would expect particularly strong reactions within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, which includes three contributors to
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>—Denmark, Canada, and
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. Scandinavians are consistently
                            critical of what they consider shortcomings of fellow <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members (e.g., Portugal), and Danes
                            have already raised question of Greek internal political developments.
                            These members might well recall <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0661"/>reiterated Greek insistence over past three years in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> that solution to Cyprus problem was
                            responsibility of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. More recently,
                            Belgium, Italy and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> have pressed for
                            cancellation of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> military exercise
                            in Greece for fear of domestic reaction against cooperation with
                            military junta.</p>
                        <p>6. Soviet Union has initiated considerable diplomatic and propaganda
                            pressure in attempt forestall any change in Cyprus status. Formal TASS
                            statement July 4 expressed Soviet concern with developments around
                            Cyprus and with attempts aggravate again situation in area endangering
                            existence Republic. Statement alleges implementation old plans for coup
                            d'etat not accidental but result <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            plan to exploit situation in Greece extending antipopular militarist
                            dictatorship to Cyprus. Soviet diplomats made virtually identical oral

                            sovereignty <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> asserting “certain
                            circles <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>” are behind it. Soviet
                            opposition was reaffirmed to liquidation Cyprus' independence, its
                            dismemberment, and conversion into <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            military base, noting such developments could lead to “significant
                            sharpening already strained situation in area.” Démarches cite previous
                            UNSC resolutions on Cyprus and call on receiving governments as
                            permanent members UNSC take all measures to thwart these dangerous
                            plans. Other East European communist states expected to follow USSR in
                            strident and probably drawnout propaganda campaign. Yugoslavia, already
                            claiming security threatened by advent authoritarian government in
                            Athens, would probably view anticipated events as extension
                            “imperialist” plot. President Tito alleges has shaped diverse
                            developments such as revolutions in Ghana, Greece, Indonesia and recent
                            events in Middle East. We would anticipate considerable Soviet and East

                            alive, even if anticipated actions were carried out effectively and

                            Council may be expected.</p>
                        <p>7. US position on Cyprus is that we are ready to agree to any arrangement
                            acceptable to the parties concerned, i.e, Cyprus and the three guarantor
                            powers (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Greece and Turkey). We have
                            urged the Turks and Greeks to continue talking, but have not asked them

                            subject of normalizing our relations with the Greek Government.<note n="2" xml:id="d296fn2">An interdepartmental regional group discussed
                                the issue on July 6. A July 13 memorandum to <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> from <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> reporting its

                            direction have been agreed upon. I am in accord with the conclusions
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>From the point of view of our relations with Greece, I consider the steps
                            outlined below important to our interests. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> is returning to Greece at the
                            end of next week and should be able to tell the Greek Government
                            something positive on this score shortly after he arrives.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation: That you approve the actions described below:<note n="3" xml:id="d296fn3">
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> endorsed the
                                recommendations of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> in a July 22 memorandum (attached to the source
                                text), but President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>
                                took no action on the recommendations. (Johnson Library, National
                                Security File, Memos to the President—<persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Walt Rostow</persName>, Vol. 35)</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>1. Since the April military coup we have withheld delivery on certain
                            major arms to Greece and been quite cool in our relations with the
                            Government with the idea not only of exhibiting disapproval of the
                            methods by which the junta seized control but also, hopefully, of
                            encouraging some return, however gradual, to more constitutional
                            processes.</p>
                        <p>2. We now believe these tactics are no longer useful and that, if
                            continued longer, may be counterproductive. The King has come to the
                            same conclusion. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> considers it quite possible the Greeks, although
                            highly desirous of close relations with us, may adopt the same tactics
                            by causing certain difficulties with some of our facilities there.</p>
                        <p>3. We have in Greece facilities important to the Air Force, the Navy,
                                [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] and USIA; they have increased <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0663"/>in value since the Arab-Israeli war.
                            That war underlined the importance of Greece (along with Turkey and
                            Iran) to U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>4. We propose that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> be authorized to inform the Greek Government of
                            certain relaxations as set forth below, making clear that future actions
                            in this regard will be related to progress in the restoration of
                            constitutional processes: (a) a coastal minesweeper ($2.9 million); (b)
                            one F–104G trainer ($1.5 million); (c) sidewinder missiles and related
                            equipment which are excess to the needs of the Netherlands (no charge);
                            and (d) 175mm cannons ( 8–$1.05 million). These items were chosen (a) as
                            having a clear <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context and (b) as
                            obviously not lending themselves to the suppression of civil
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <p>5. We believe we should not release just yet either tanks, helicopters,
                            or other heavy equipment. (With respect to FRG shipment of military
                            assistance to Greece, particularly including tanks, we believe we should
                            give the Germans the go-ahead signal in the near future but not just at
                            this time.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <hi rend="italic">Congressional Problems</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Although the timing of this action is not particularly favorable given
                            the concern in Congressional quarters with respect to arms programs,
                            both sale and grant, nevertheless, we believe we must proceed and that
                            the over-all interest of foreign policy requires that we do so as soon
                            as possible. We judge that although there will be some adverse reaction
                            in Congress and elsewhere, it will not be great and can be reasonably
                            contained by stressing the following:</p>
                        <p>a. This is a minimum step.</p>
                        <p>b. Greece, like Turkey and Iran, emerges as particularly important to the
                            U.S. given the uncertainties in the Middle East and the Soviet thrust in
                            that area.</p>
                        <p>c. It is essential that we maintain Greece as an active and functioning
                            member of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> under whose umbrella the
                            arms programs are developed.</p>
                        <p>d. We must avoid pressing Greece in the direction of the French with
                            their lukewarm and unhelpful posture in a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context.</p>
                        <p>2. If you approve the above course of action, we will undertake a certain
                            amount of educational work on the Hill. How much can perhaps better be
                            determined after the appearance on July 26 of Secretary of Defense
                                <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName> before the Senate

                        <p>Dear Dan:</p>
                        <p>Having heard nothing further on the limited military assistance items
                            whose transfer was recommended by <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss>
                            and <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss>, I assume that the process of
                            getting White House and Congressional clearance has, as we had more or
                            less anticipated, proved difficult. I also assume that my extended
                            presence in Washington would not have changed this situation, and that
                            it was wise for me to leave the Capitol and return to Athens on
                            schedule.</p>
                        <p>At this end my impressions are gradually taking shape, but I have
                            hesitated to express my views on the changing scene before fresh talks
                            with the military members of the Government as well as with the King and
                            the Prime Minister. Later this week I would hope that process would be
                            sufficiently advanced to permit me to express fresh opinions with
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>My tentative impressions are that internal consolidation by the coup
                            group has substantially advanced during my absence and that as more
                            prospective difficulties have become apparent there is greater
                            sensitivity and some change in the wider public mood.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, purging of persons on whom the coup leaders cannot
                            confidently depend has proceeded not only through the upper reaches of
                            the Air Force and Navy (but not yet the Army) but also into the
                            gendarmerie and police as well as civilian ministries and agencies. Some
                            changes are distinct improvements, e.g., ETVA and GAEC. Elsewhere
                            replacements have either proved undistinguished or, indeed, unavailable.
                            While the departure of <persName corresp="#p_ZZ1">Zolotas</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ2">John Pezmazoglu</persName> will
                            undoubtedly attract the most international attention, with Galanis at
                            the helm this shift may be less important than changes in other
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Distasteful developments include the tightening of the screws in the
                            fields of education and the arts. The Embassy's airgram (A–68)<note n="2" xml:id="d297fn2">Airgram A–68, August 3, reported on education
                                and the arts under the Junta. (Ibid., Central Files, CUL 2
                                GREECE)</note> spells out these details. Nor is it encouraging to
                            hear that Papaconstantinou is running into increasing frustrations so
                            that instead of an early end to press censorship we could just possibly
                            see an early end to Papaconstantinou as a Government official.</p>
                        <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0665"/>
                        <p>As the Embassy has reported, the economy shows many signs of weakness
                            including spreading unemployment in the industrial sector. You have seen
                            our reports of labor restiveness. Businessmen, too, seem more acutely
                            aware now than in June of the prospect that this reform government will
                            put a sharper tax bite on them than has been their past lot.</p>
                        <p>On the constitutional front there is a good deal of confusion and of
                            skepticism. We should get deeper into this question during the current
                            week. In any event, I hear numbers of people now discussing matters from
                            the implicit assumption that the coup group will attempt to stay in
                            power indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>By and large, however, my impression is that a good many influential
                            Greeks believe the country still has open options and that perhaps the
                            King with American encouragement can bring this Government to a
                            recognition of the need for constitutional progress. Since this is so
                            central a question in the United States, I would rather hold off for
                            some days before making a current estimate of the prospects. As the
                            Embassy's recent reporting has made clear, there are a good many
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>All this should not, I believe, be interpreted to mean that we should go
                            slowly on the limited moves agreed to by <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss>. On the
                            contrary, my fears have been strengthened that the Greeks are moving
                            into a prickly and negative mood and that it will not be easy to
                            persuade them to wait quietly while we sort out our domestic policy
                            issues. The argument in favor of flexibility in handling military
                            assistance remains very strong indeed. If we are to have any chance of
                            pulling Greece into the direction of constitutionalism, this one limited
                            bit of leverage should certainly be available to us.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that an interim letter of this kind may do more to raise the
                            level of your concerns than to clarify your analyses of the situation
                            here. I will have to try to be better based and more explicit in
                            communicating with you later in the week.</p>
                        <p>With best wishes always,</p>
                        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

                        <p>August 8</p>
                        <p>P.S. After dictating the above paragraphs yesterday, I had a reception
                            last evening for Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_Iakovos1">Iakovos</persName> which brought into the open a disturbing note of
                            which we were already generally aware. None of the invited Ministers
                            turned up. (Nor, it appears, did either <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> or <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> attend the
                            Fourth of July reception.) In the course of the afternoon, when
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>' staff man, Major Lambropoulos,
                            telephoned the Minister's regrets for the evening, Geoff Ogden told him
                            that Congressman <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0666"/>Brademas would
                            like to see the Colonel and suggested a drink at the Residence sometime
                            today. Lambropoulos was exceedingly curt in explaining the Minister was
                            busy today and in any event a request to see the Minister should be made
                            through the Protocol Office of the Foreign Office. He had earlier given
                            Stephen Calligas a similar answer to a request by Malcolm Forbes for a
                            meeting. It is evident that we have a problem. Whether resistance to
                            social relations is a harbinger of further counter-irritance to our
                            policy of coolness and non-decision on military matters is a question we
                            will try to probe promptly though deftly.</p>

                                reported King Constantine's impressions of the internal political
                                situation. (Ibid.)</note>

                        <p>1. During my conversation with King July 30 he referred once again to the
                            possibility that in end he might have to come into confrontation with
                            present regime. As Dept aware King's view of inevitability or
                            desirability of confrontation has varied in past several months
                            depending generally on temperature of his cooperative relationship with
                            Junta (read <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>). More recently King has
                            indicated he views immediate period after submission of draft
                            Constitution as sensitive one in which confrontation may be unavoidable
                            if regime does not keep faith with its assurances re Constitution and
                            early referendum [<hi rend="italic">document number not
                                declassified</hi>].<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3">Not found.</note>
                            This same three-month period is also considered one of incipient crisis
                            by a majority of Greeks who for present are willing to give regime
                            chance to prove its intention.</p>
                        <p>2. King spoke of contacts he had made with senior Generals and others,
                            and seemed reasonably expectant that in event of showdown he could get
                            adequate support to oust Junta. He did not want to precipitate action,
                            however, unless US knew and approved of his purposes. He did not ask, as
                            he had done in the past, about prospects that he could count on American
                            fleet presence or logistic assistance.</p>
                        <p>3. In replying, I pointed out that at present US heavily committed in
                            many parts of the world. I tried to get him to understand that US should
                                <pb n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0667"/>not be looked to for
                            participation in any change in governmental arrangements. This sort of
                            decision could be made only by him. King said he understood, but if it
                            should become necessary to move he would advise <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in advance.</p>
                        <p>4. As example of influences now being brought to bear on King, I was
                            interested in his account of secret visit to him by retired General
                            Gennimatas, former Chief of HNDGS. Latter had reminded him there had
                            long been suspicions that Papadopoulos and other colonels had been
                            plotting and that he, Gennimatas, had dispersed them to distant commands
                            whereas subsequently Gen. Spandidakis had permitted them to reassemble
                            in Athens posts. He thought this could mean <hi rend="italic">Spandidakis</hi> was in on plot, though he hoped not. In any case,
                            colonels are more known than respected by armed forces, who now accept
                            their authority for lack of current alternative. Gennimatas proposed
                            that when new Constitution ready King move to dispose of colonels. They
                            could be thanked for their role in saving country from Communism,
                            decorated, and returned to dispersed units or retired. From then on,
                            armed forces would pay no attention to them. Alternatively, they could
                            be forced to resign from army in order to stay in politics. Here, again,
                            they would lose grip over armed forces. Key point, he said, was not to
                            permit important further changes in the army before the new Constitution
                            readied. It would then be essential to move before Junta consolidated
                            control over army commands. Whatever course King might choose to pursue
                            in ridding country of these colonels, Gennimatas was convinced armed
                            forces would support him absolutely. King had listened with interest but
                            without commitments. He said he did not know whether Gennimatas was
                            organizing a movement among senior military people against the colonels,
                            but in any case he would not interfere. (DATT comment: Gennimatas' views
                            are correct but he is not known to be in any particular contact with any
                            group.)</p>
                        <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> We have recently had reports of
                            preliminary plotting by several groups of officers (mostly recently
                            retired) [<hi rend="italic">2 document numbers not

                            King would support a countercoup. (It is fairly generally assumed that
                            his trips to north were for purpose polling amount of support he could
                            count on in such event.) Some may also believe that American attitude of
                            coolness toward a “colonels” regime implies we would support a
                            countercoup by other military. However, we see no evidence yet that
                            plotters pinpointed so far would be an improvement over current regime,
                            either as scheduling early return to constitutional processes or acting
                            with more leniency in repressive measures. This estimate would, of
                            course, be revised if regime gave indications of betraying assurances
                            both to US and Greek public re return to parliamentary life. We will
                            also have to <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0668"/>watch carefully
                            what, if any, progress various groups make in coalescing to point they
                            undermine regime's control of key units in Attica area or consolidate
                            their control of sufficient other ones (Larrissa and the north) to
                            neutralize regime's superiority in Attica.</p>
                        <p>6. <hi rend="italic">(Comments cont'd)</hi> Some of the plotters are
                            known to have been awaiting my return and any comments I might make,

                            attitude toward present regime. To extent there are incipient coup
                            ambitions in Greek military, we face tricky period of attempting to
                            avoid giving impression either that we firmly endorse present regime or
                            that we would encourage some countercoup.</p>

                            only for my ears.</p>
                        <p>2. I have now had two conversations with him<note n="2" xml:id="d299fn2">Reported in telegram 967 from Ankara, August 29. (Ibid.)</note> and
                            expect follow-up tomorrow with Asst SecGen Turkmen, following which

                            President's future conversation with King Constantine in Washington. In
                            interim it is clear that:</p>
                        <p>A. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> are and have been in contact throughout last month
                            regarding Greek proposal for PriMinister level meeting. There is no lack
                            of contact. Proposal has been under intensive review and apparently
                            considered by National Security Council evening Aug 29. Ambassador Tuluy
                            here from Athens as an advisor. Further details by separate message.</p>
                        <p>B. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is not well impressed with
                            proposal for <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss>-level meeting which it
                            sees as reflecting <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> desire for
                            “gesture” to show to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies <pb n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0669"/>that it is legitimate govt by
                            appearing to negotiate major question with its neighbor. On substance
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> sees no signs <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> prepared to take real step forward.
                            Caglayangil adversely impressed by “bargaining tactics” of Greek Govt,
                            failure to make progress on substantive preparations for high-level
                            meeting. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> concerned over position in
                            which would find itself in proceeding to such meeting (which could not
                            be held without publicity) in face recent Greek public pronouncements
                            that only solution for Cyprus is enosis. If Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName> went to meeting under present
                            circumstances his political opposition would galvanize general Turk
                            public around suspicion he meeting <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> “to discuss enosis.”</p>
                        <p>3. I made point that our assessment of King Constantine, with whom
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> enjoys
                            particularly close relations, is that he is deeply committed to find
                            Cyprus settlement which would lay basis for permanent friendship with
                            Turkey; and that he could and would be sort of guarantor or underwriter
                            of any agreed settlement, thus legitimizing it for an elected successor
                            Greek Govt. Caglayangil agreed with our assessment of King but stated
                            GOT does not feel same confidence toward rest of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, which in discussions continuously raises the ante
                            “from two to eight” in its own favor. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has emphasized to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            that on basis its four principles “there are 20 ways” to settle Cyprus
                            problem: federation, cantonment, adjustment of Zurich agreements, etc.
                            Greece on other hand offers Turkey “lease for sixty or eighty years”.
                            Former US Ambassador Warren (believe he meant Amb. <persName corresp="#p_HRA1">Hare</persName>) had supported such offer to
                                <persName corresp="#p_II1">Inonu</persName> who replied that even if
                            Parliament accepted it he would refuse for “only a big power can keep a
                            base on foreign territory.” In answer my query about personalities he
                            said Economou-Gouras is a technician and ineffectual. <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> much better but controlled by,
                            not controlling, the military leaders. I said this left question of how
                            dialogue could be carried forward but I expected that King Constantine
                            would mention privately to President at Washington <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>'s “unanswered” proposal for <gloss target="#t_PM1">PM</gloss> level meeting. As it possible that King
                            is not fully informed on <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> exchanges proposal, was there something
                            useful President could say in rejoinder?</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil suggested might be emphasized to King that in view tension
                            in Middle East now is time for rapid solution of Cyprus problem. Greece
                            should recognize that Turkish attitudes conditioned by former possession
                            of Cyprus and by allegiance of Turk-Cypriots to Turkey. It should
                            therefore take into account not just what is in Turkey's interest but
                            what is within Turkey's range of possibilities, in negotiating Cyprus
                            settlement. Then he hesitated and said <persName corresp="#p_TI1">Turkmen</persName> would let me have more closely reasoned
                            suggestion August 30. (This being Turk holiday I expect it may be August
                            31.)</p>
                        <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0670"/>
                        <p>I also stressed that we also felt that now was time to reach such
                            agreement since present Govt of Greece, if it could be galvanized to
                            take substantive steps would not need concern itself as much with press
                            or public position as would a successor elected government. Latter in

                                will tour of Europe and Canada. Following the April coup, the
                                Western European portion of the tour was cancelled. Telegram 589
                                from Athens, July 30, reported that the King hoped to utilize some
                                of the days originally scheduled for Europe to make an informal
                                visit to the United States and had requested a meeting with the

                                reported that the King had expressed the desire for a private
                                meeting with the President to discuss Cyprus and internal Greek
                                developments. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 7
                                GREECE)</note> While the main purpose of his visit is to explain the
                            aims of the Greek Government which came to power in the April 21, 1967
                            coup and to obtain U.S. understanding and support for the Government, at
                            the same time he will seek Presidential assurances of U.S. backing in
                            any confrontation he might <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0671"/>have
                            with the Greek junta. The King views his role as one of continuously
                            pressing the coup leaders in the direction of a return to democratic
                            processes. He also believes that his standing with the junta, as well as
                            Greek-U.S. relations, will be enhanced by the resumption of U.S.
                            military assistance to Greece. The very fact that you have agreed to
                            receive him will strengthen his position with the Government.</p>
                        <p>We share the King's view that he can play a constructive role in
                            encouraging the Greek Government in the direction of constitutionalism.
                            However, we believe we should caution him against pushing the regime to
                            the point of provoking a confrontation, since we do not want to see
                            armed conflict in Greece and would not wish to intervene militarily in
                            his behalf. We realize that walking such a narrow line is a difficult
                            course to follow, and believe that the visit offers the occasion to
                            reassure the 27-year old King of our recognition of the importance of
                            the monarchy as well as our appreciation of his vital role in returning
                            the country to constitutionalism. On military assistance, we believe
                            that you should inform the King that full resumption of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> is out of the question at this time
                            because of strong public and Congressional sentiment against such a
                            move; however, we are prepared to consider releasing a few of the items
                            now currently suspended. In this way we can bolster the King's position
                            vis-à-vis the coup leadership as well as prevent our own relations with
                            the Greek Government from becoming frozen.</p>
                        <p>In sum, we believe that the visit of the King can serve a useful purpose
                            in making clear our profound desire for continued close relations with
                            Greece as well as our belief in the necessity for an early return to
                            constitutional government. It also provides an opportunity to reassure
                            the King of our support for him and at the same time to discourage him
                            from moving into a confrontation with the junta.</p>

                        <p>King Constantine of Greece in his conversations with the President
                            described developments in Greece and pointed to two times at which the
                            confrontation with the coup leaders might occur: (1) at the time the
                            committee report on the constitutional revision was reviewed by the coup
                            leaders, and (2) at the time of a plebiscite on the constitutional
                            revision. The first might be in December, the second later in 1968. The
                            King was not certain that a confrontation would occur on the other
                            hand—it might occur at any time if a “second round” were attempted—but
                            these two times were obvious potential points when the crunch might
                            come. The King elaborated on the fact that if a confrontation were to
                            occur, it would be on issues of real substance, not on such questions
                            as, for example, military appointments.</p>
                        <p>The King expressed a lack of confidence in the coup leaders' ability to
                            come up with coherent government policies. He did not think that they
                            had the talents to govern. He was evidently by no means confident that
                            they would stick to the constitutional commitment and schedule.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of return to constitutional government and the King's
                            relationships with the military in general, he noted that he had some
                            support of certain military leaders in the northern areas but he
                            recognized that as time went on the coup leaders were attempting to
                            infiltrate all commands with officers of absolute loyalty to them.</p>
                        <p>The King spoke at some length about the question of confrontation and his
                            relationships with the coup leaders. He gave the impression of being
                            serious-minded and devoted to the concept of returning Greece to
                            constitutional procedures and democratic processes. He stated that he
                            was willing to get his family out of Greece if tensions between him and
                            the coup leaders grew, and to go so far as to risk his life if a
                            confrontation were unavoidable.</p>
                        <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0673"/>
                        <p>He inquired as to what we were prepared to do in the case of a
                            confrontation and spoke of the possibility of (1) the landing of marines
                            as a show of force, (2) the positioning of Sixth Fleet units in Greek
                            waters, and (3) a sympathetic U.S. posture and a public statement
                            reaffirming the U.S. support for the King's efforts to return the
                            country to constitutionalism.</p>
                        <p>The President explained the problems growing out of such a request and
                            noted that a military intervention would not be feasible. The question
                            of a public statement would be studied in the light of circumstances at
                            the time, but he could not commit himself in advance on this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>Addressing himself to the question of military aid, the King made a plea
                            for restoration of military aid, noting that the continued withholding
                            of aid was not achieving the U.S. political objectives and causing
                            serious irritation to the coup colonels. Some military aid linked to
                            continued loyalty to the constitutional scenario would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>The President made clear that he could make no commitment until
                            legislation was passed but indicated that he understood the King's
                            argument. In terms of specific requests, the King pointed to the need to
                            be in a position to communicate with his people in the event of a
                            confrontation and asked for a possible use of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> radio facilities (either Thessaloniki or more likely
                            Rhodes). Secondly, he asked for more efficient two-way communications
                            facilities between the Palace and the US Embassy in Athens. His third
                            request was for US support of a program loan of $70 million for Greece
                            to assist in the reconstruction of the earthquake-damaged areas. On this
                            subject Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWW1">Rostow</persName> explained the
                            problems involved in reopening the question of a program loan for a
                            country that had graduated from the <gloss target="#t_AID1">AID</gloss>
                            school and had achieved the economic growth rate which Greece had over
                            the past years. Speaking to the question of the earthquake, it was
                            stated that the needs on that front could be examined with a view to any
                            assistance of a humanitarian nature that might be given to relieve the
                            temporary housing needs in the stricken areas. There was talk of
                            examining the possibility of obtaining Nissen huts but it was understood
                            that this matter would have to be explored more fully with Athens.</p>
                        <p>The King explained the legal position with <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName>, and the President explained our
                            political problem with him and other political prisoners. It was clear
                            the King did not rule out an amnesty once the legal procedures had been
                            followed.</p>
                        <p>The King explained his deep disappointment in the failure of the Cyprus
                            talks. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> volunteered
                            that he would take the matter up with the two Foreign Secretaries in New
                            York.</p>

                        <p>1. While Department had not expected weekend talks between Greek and Turk
                            Prime Ministers would lead to immediate or dramatic results, we are
                            disappointed learn that two parties were so far apart. We had felt
                            earlier <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName>-Caglayangil
                            conversations were leading in direction “compensated enosis” and had
                            believed <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> willingness offer <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> sovereign base area on Cyprus would be
                            main ingredient in Turkish acceptance enosis. On other hand, Greek
                            delegation probably went Kesan/Alexandropolis meeting with somewhat
                            exaggerated expectations. One can speculate that becoming aware of Greek
                            junta's desire achieve settlement for political reasons, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has somewhat raised its price for
                            agreement. We would appreciate views Embassies Athens and Ankara this
                            point.</p>
                        <p>2. We are concerned lest this setback could lead to loss momentum and
                            dissipation of favorable atmosphere which has existed. Both sides seem
                            be weary of prolonged stalemate since December 1963. In talking with
                            senior officials of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, we hope you will convey our strong
                            belief that Prime Ministerial meeting, although lacking in concrete
                            results, represents act of statesmanship and sincere endeavor to frankly
                            come to grips with Cyprus problem. We hope that both countries will
                            avoid taking rigid or intransigent positions, and will not rake over
                            past grievances. Important thing now is that talks continue, and that
                            real effort be made compromise on differences which, if substantial, do
                            not seem be irreconcilable.</p>

                        <p>39286. 1. <gloss target="#t_NEA1">NEA</gloss> is considering recommending
                            to the Secretary that in his forthcoming talks with Turkish and Greek
                            Prime Ministers at 22nd GA he raise the possibility of an approach to
                            Cyprus problem which might by-pass the major difficulties which we
                            believe Greeks and Turks have been encountering in their bilateral
                            talks. We would suggest that if this initiative seemed to evoke interest
                            on the part of the two Foreign Ministers, the Secretary might agree to
                            the discreet presentation of such possibility in more concrete form at a
                            time and place to be mutually agreed upon. It would be made clear we not
                            offering to mediate, but rather to assist efforts of parties concerned
                            which we continue to regard as best road to solution.</p>
                        <p>2. Substance of the proposal we have in mind is the creation of a form of
                            commonwealth relationship between Greece and Cyprus, with substantial
                            guarantees for the Turkish Cypriots and advantages for Turkey. This
                            follows along the lines of Wehmeyer paper which you have seen.</p>
                        <p>3. If our calculation is correct, the atmosphere making for a settlement
                            is better now than it has been for some time. We believe there is
                            mounting weariness on the part of all concerned with the existing
                            stalemate, the expense involved and the damage to the Greek and Turkish
                            security situation in the Eastern Mediterranean. At the same time we
                            think we detect disappointment and uncertainty on the part of the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. A proffer of good offices on our part
                            would, we think, be well received, although we cannot of course predict
                            that it would have tangible results. It should be emphasized that we are
                            thinking of a careful, discreet and cautious approach to the matter, so
                            as minimize possibility misinterpretation of our motives. On balance we
                            tend to think possible gains overbalance predictable disadvantages.</p>

                        <p>1. King Constantine last night expressed to me his “fed-upness” with
                            hardened Turkish position which had brought to naught Prime Ministerial
                            meeting on which he had pinned strong hopes. Acknowledging Greek side
                            might have bungled discussions, King doubted even extreme Greek
                            ineptness could have caused such sharp change in Turkish position. He
                            could not understand how Turkish side could say enosis had not been
                            contemplated when even word enosis was included in paper jointly signed
                            by <persName corresp="#p_TAJ1">Toumbas</persName> and Caglayangil last
                            December. <persName>Col. Papadopoulos</persName> and his associates now
                            believe British probably responsible for Turkish intransigence.<note n="2" xml:id="d304fn2">Queried by the Department of State in
                                telegram 41302 to Athens, September 21, about the apparent
                                discrepancies in Greek versions of this meeting, <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> responded in telegram 1431
                                from Athens, September 22, that enosis was mentioned in the “Basic
                                Principles” document initialed by the Foreign Ministers at the
                                beginning of the meeting and that this had been inserted by the
                                Greek side as one of its objectives. In initialing, the Turkish
                                Foreign Minister was simply acknowledging he understood the other
                                side's basic principles. (Both ibid.)</note> (I expressed doubt
                            British could or would have played that role.) King himself could think
                            of no reason except Turkish desire to trim sails to Soviet winds on eve
                            of Demirel's Moscow visit. In any case, King saw no point in further
                            efforts to deal with Turkish Government at this stage. Perhaps when
                            Turkish reasoning clarified, somebody (presumably meaning U.S.) could
                            help get Turks back on rails. In meantime King would have no further
                            interest in “this kind of game.”</p>
                        <p>2. I commented that out of our own sad experiences with international
                            disputes we had repeatedly been taught necessity for patience and
                            persistence. Continuation of dialogue could be very important. King
                            heard me out but without further comment turned to other subjects.</p>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister declared at the outset that the Cyprus problem, of
                            course, was by far the major issue for them. He said that Cyprus was not
                            surprised at the result of the Evros talks, because the Cypriots had
                            always had reservations with regard to the Greek-Turkish dialogue. He
                            said that now that the dialogue is ended Cyprus is considering what
                            should be done next. He said that the situation in Cyprus is improved
                            over what it was a year ago, and it is time to strengthen efforts for
                            peace by finding another procedure to follow. Could common ground be

                            that the Cyprus Government is thinking in terms of “good offices”.
                            Possibly something along this line might make it easier for the Greeks
                            and the Turks. A vacuum may be dangerous, he said. We are in a period of
                            reconsideration, and are ready to consider anything.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he knew that U Thant was concerned about the cost
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force on Cyprus. He said that U
                            Thant had mentioned it at his dinner for the Big Four Foreign Ministers
                            but there was not much reaction from the Ministers. The Foreign Minister
                            said that the annual cost is about $8 million.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the US has no fresh ideas on the subject, and
                            asked the Foreign Minister if the Cyprus Government is in a hurry for
                            action. <pb n="640" xml:id="pg_640" facs="0678"/>The Foreign Minister
                            replied that there is no particular hurry, but the situation cannot
                            continue on indefinitely. He observed that some procedure such as good
                            offices would have a calming effect. He mentioned that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> force on the island had a peacemaking as
                            well as peacekeeping role. The Secretary asked if the presence of the
                            force causes problems, and the Foreign Minister replied in the negative,
                            saying that an absence of the force would, however.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether the Foreign Minister thought that a new
                            procedure would lead quickly to a solution. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> did not think so, but he
                            believed it would be helpful in eliminating impractical ideas. The
                            Turks, for instance, are thinking of a condominium. In reply to a
                            question the Foreign Minister said he believed there is a consensus
                            among the people of the island for enosis. He thought the use of good
                            offices would be a way of clarifying many of the issues involved. The
                            Cyprus problem is affected by the situation in Greece, he said. With
                            regard to the Turks, is it a problem for them of security or of the
                            Turkish Cypriots? Do the Turks want partition? Under good offices this
                            could all be discussed in a logical way.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told the Foreign Minister that in his meeting yesterday
                            with Turkish Foreign Minister Caglayangil<note n="2" xml:id="d305fn2">Memoranda of <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>'s
                                conversations with Caglayangil are ibid.</note> the word Cyprus did
                            not come up once. The Secretary added that it would be convenient if the
                            US could take the same position the British did for three years back in
                            the 40's with regard to the Palestine question. Their position was that
                            Britain would go along with anything the parties concerned decided.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary ascertained that the Foreign Minister had spoken to U Thant
                            about the possibility of a new procedure being adopted. He said that U
                            Thant would like to stop spending that $8 million a year, and he is
                            certainly entitled to try to do so. The Secretary commented that there
                            might be two or three procedures: to find a solution, to keep things in
                            hand until a solution is found, or to keep things in hand without
                            anything further in mind. He said he would talk with his colleagues in
                            the Department on the subject of a new procedure.</p>

                            <item>Foreign Minister Paul Economou-Gouras </item>
                            <item>Ambassador to the US Christian Palamas </item>

                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that work was going forward on drafting a Greek
                            Constitution. When the Secretary asked if there was something on paper,
                            the Foreign Minister said it is too early since work is now only in the
                            pre-draft stage. It is hoped that a working draft will be available in
                            about a month and that there will be a final draft before the end of the
                            year. He said that the Greek Government would be sending a committee to
                            the US, France, and the Scandinavian countries to consult with
                            constitutional experts.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister declared that the Greeks are concerned about the
                            weakening of the security situation in their area. He said that in
                            addition to the threat from the north, Soviet naval forces now in the
                            Mediterranean to the south make the country feel insecure. He mentioned
                            that Greece has a long border—850 miles—with communist territory. He
                            said that he would like to see <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            concentrate not only on the defense of its flanks but also on the
                            interior lines. The Secretary said that there should be no worry in a
                            military sense because of the Soviet naval force. They are in an exposed
                            position, and would go back into the Black Sea if trouble were in the
                            offing. The Foreign Minister agreed that the Soviet naval force was more
                            serious from a political than from a military aspect.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister declared that Greece wanted to be helped by its
                            friends. The Secretary said that the Greek regime caused a big problem
                            in US, and our whole aid bill is having difficult passage in Congress as
                            a result. The Secretary explained that the President and the Executive
                                <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0680"/>branch of our government
                            get no money at all to spend that is not authorized by the Congress. The
                            King's visit and his discussions with members of Congress helped, but we
                            will not know for a while what funds will be authorized. Perhaps we will
                            have more of an idea in two weeks or so.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that the Greek leaders are not ambitious. They
                            are patriotic men who want to see Greece out of the mess it is in. The
                            Foreign Minister said that he is afraid they would become desperate when
                            Greece's friends do not show an understanding attitude. He pointed out
                            that Greece had voted with the United States yesterday in the debate in
                            the General Assembly on the question of defining aggression. Turkey and
                            Cyprus had abstained in the vote.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Greek coup d'etat was the sixty-fourth to
                            occur in the world since he became Secretary of State. He observed that
                            there had been no prior consultation with us, and the coup had created
                            serious problems for us. While we recognize that the matter is an
                            internal one for Greece, it does cause the US problems. The Secretary
                            said that we are friends and allies, and both of us would like to see
                            our relations improve, but it will take time.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister remarked that he and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_PCC1">Palamas</persName> continue to have hope, and that
                            is why they are serving this government. The Secretary replied that we
                            take note of the fact that men like the Minister and the Ambassador are
                            in the Greek Government and draw encouragement from this fact. The
                            Foreign Minister mentioned that he and others are fighting to keep
                            Greece in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. He asked why there was
                            so much criticism against Greece and not Portugal. The Secretary
                            answered that probably people expect more of Greece.</p>

                        <p>Fighting between Turkish Cypriot military formations and Greek Cypriot
                            police and National Guard units broke out on November 15, 1967, at Agios
                            Theodoros and nearby Kophinou. On November 16, the Turkish Government
                            demanded that Greek Cypriots immediately cease their attacks and
                            threatened military intervention. The following day, a Turkish note to
                            the Greek Government demanded the removal of its troops on Cyprus, the
                            recall of General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>,
                            compensation for victims of Greek Cypriot attacks, and the end of
                            restrictions on Turkish Cypriots. <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0681"/>After consultations with the involved states and at the
                            United Nations, the United States decided to send a special envoy to the
                            area to support the efforts of U.N. and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> representatives to avoid a military clash over the

                            Between November 23 and December 4, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> shuttled among Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia in an

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> said that the highest
                            authorities here were very much concerned by developments on Cyprus. He
                            asked the Ambassador whether there were any recent indications of what
                            the Turks intended to do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> explained that his
                            last information was that the Turkish Government was still trying to
                            decide what to do. He, <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>, had
                            informed (Turkish Foreign Ministry Secretary General) Kuneralp that the
                            fighting had stopped in accord with orders from Athens. Kuneralp was
                            “very happy” at this news. <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0682"/>He
                            was also gratified by information that <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> was endeavoring to bring the situation at the
                            “villages” back to the status quo ante. The Ambassador had also informed
                            Kuneralp that <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> wished to
                            remove the National Guard from the villages. Of course, he said, we did
                            not know how future developments might emerge, and we therefore could
                            not be certain how the Turkish Government would behave.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> said there was a
                            good deal of activity and meetings in Ankara. The heads of the Turkish
                            military forces had been meeting that night, for example. He did expect,
                            he said, certain precautionary moves. The Ambassador thought it rather
                            unlikely that the Turks would take any “particular action” with matters
                            quiet on the island. He reiterated that he did not now anticipate
                            “forceful action” but quickly made clear that this estimate was good
                            only as long as there was quiet and no further spread of fighting.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador went on to mention that some 30 percent of the Turkish
                            Cypriot population was in the Nicosia triangle and that an estimated
                            10,000 Turks were in the region affected by the fighting. Whether quiet
                            would remain in that region was still a question, he admitted. He said
                            that, sharing what he understood was also the US opinion, the Turks were
                            firmly convinced that General <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> was behind all the trouble. Cabinet meetings had
                            taken place on this subject and he understood that the Cabinet Ministers
                            and the service chiefs had held a joint meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName> at this juncture said
                            he had just received a message from Athens (Athens 2148)<note n="2" xml:id="d308fn2">Dated November 16. (Ibid.)</note> concerning the
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> request to the GOC to withdraw
                            the National Guard. He conveyed the substance of this message to the
                            Ambassador. He reiterated that the point of his call was to register the
                            real concern in the highest quarters in Washington over these
                            developments. These quarters were gravely concerned that the interests
                            of all parties were endangered. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> said that this message from Athens was most welcome
                            and he thought it would assist him in his own efforts.</p>

                        <p>1. I took occasion of delivery of Secretary's message to Prime Minister
                            (State 70871)<note n="2" xml:id="d309fn2">Telegram 70871 to Athens,

                                the Cyprus issue. (Ibid.)</note> to weigh in heavily with him (and
                            later with King) on potential further serious explosion unless <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> is removed from Cyprus scene
                            immediately, even though temporarily.</p>
                        <p>2. PriMin thanked me for Secretary's message and said that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is determined to show greatest wisdom
                            and restraint in order to preserve peace between two countries. He
                            reverted to his suspicions of Turkish intentions, referring to
                            following: Turk overflights, Turk armored brig being moved towards
                            Everos triangle and demonstrations in Istanbul when anti-Greek and
                            anti-American slogans heard. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had
                            strictly forbidden any intervention of RHAF in connection overflights
                            and movement of Greek troops toward Evros from Alexandropoulis had been
                            halted. I congratulated him on this restraint and said that as one who
                            is deeply concerned about situation I must say that today looks worse
                            than yesterday did, particularly with the renewal of patrolling in Agios
                            Theodoros. He did not appear aware of this development. I passed on our
                            reports from Nicosia (Nicosia 638 and previous).<note n="3" xml:id="d309fn3">Telegram 638 from Nicosia, November 17, reported on
                                further fighting in Cyprus. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. I said I was afraid that this resumption would not be taken by Ankara
                            as indication of restraint and peaceful inclinations on part Cypriot
                            Govt.</p>
                        <p>4. I then turned to <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName>
                            problem and said that I did not like to refer to individuals when
                            discussing policy matters yet as one who had lived through Cyprus
                            difficulties in 1964, I felt that Turks would no doubt take the
                            traditional attitudes and look upon <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> actions as having been ordered by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> since both <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and other Greek officers serving in Cyprus are
                            all active officers of Greek forces. PriMin insisted this was not
                            correct because as soon as <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had
                            learned of <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> actions it had
                            at once made strong recommendation and on next day requested GOC to
                            refrain from any further action re Agios Theodoros. <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> and other regular Greek
                            officers in Cyprus take their orders from GOC not Athens govt. I said I
                            was not speaking under instructions but had been mulling <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0684"/>over ways which might help reduce
                            tension. It had occurred to me that one way might be to invite <persName corresp="#p_GLGG1">Grivas</persName> to Athens for consultations.
                            Such gesture could be taken in Ankara as sign of good faith of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and its desire to reduce tension on
                            island. I continued that there are hawks and doves in Ankara and we do
                            not know what decisions and discussions are being held there nor what
                            has been said during last 24 hours that GNA has been meeting behind
                            closed doors. PriMin promptly replied that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had already thought of this. He regrets that his
                            thoughts coincided with those of the American Ambassador. Now if this
                            action is taken it will be presumed that it is result of American
                            pressure. I replied I would be more than glad to withdraw suggestion at
                            once.</p>
                        <p>5. I assured PriMin I was aware that many people feel that American
                            recommendations for restraint are made only in Athens. All one could say
                            to them is that they do not know what has been happening in Ankara
                            during the last week. PriMin said he understood that and certainly
                            recommendations for moderation from US to two allies who are in
                            difficulty cannot be interpreted as intervention. He reverted to another
                            recount of his suspicions of intentions of Turks to create yet another
                            pocket and cut off Nicosia-Limassol-Larnaca road. He then appealed to US
                            to use all possible means to convince Turkish side of good intentions of
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> because he feels that good faith
                            on part <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> only may not be enough. I
                            assured him that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> is well aware of
                            good intentions of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and we would be
                            happy to help in any way that PriMin feels would be helpful to both
                            parties.</p>
                        <p>6. Although our conversation laid sensitive problem on the line in frank
                            tones, PriMin did not react in scratchy, near irascible manner he
                            sometimes does. He appeared to be deeply worried man seeking way out of
                                dilemma.<note n="4" xml:id="d309fn4">In telegram 2182 from Athens,

                            into Turkish and Caglayangil immediately dictated following provisional
                            reaction:</p>
                        <p>“I would like to thank President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and the US Govt for the interest they have shown
                            in the matter but I would like to point out that the problem is no
                            longer a problem of passions or good will. You know that the incident of
                            the Greek patrols to Bogazici (Ayios Theodoros) has caused very tragic
                            events. Twenty-four of my kinsmen have been killed. One thousand Turks
                            had to flee their homes and live under deprivation. An 80-year old man,
                            a Turk, has been burned alive in Gecitkale (Kophinou). Tortures like the
                            ones used in the Middle Ages have been applied against the Turkish
                            community, and after all these tragic events we have seen that the
                            Greeks have again sent their patrol yesterday and today in a very
                            ostentatious manner. This example of the 80-year old man who was burned
                            alive which has shocked you (he referred to my facial expression) is
                            only one incident among many others. If you can read them without being
                            shocked and without feeling nausea, I can give you other accounts of
                            events which have been witnessed by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces. The Turkish public opinion and the Turkish
                            community have been incurably aroused against the Turkish Govt. We have
                            sent today to the people of Gecitkale some relief goods through the
                            Turkish Red Crescent and these people are people whose houses have been
                            destroyed, whose belongings have been pillaged and who had barely
                            escaped a massacre. They were all hungry and despite the fact that they
                            were hungry they have refused all the relief goods and they said:</p>
                        <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0687"/>
                        <p>“'We don't want anything from Turkey. Get out of here.' This is not a sad
                            story I am telling you, it is what happened today in the island.</p>
                        <p>“We, as the Turkish people, have a love for the American people because
                            we feel they are our friends, because we share their philosophy and
                            their democratic principles and it is for this reason that we have
                            formed our destiny with that of the United States. Because we believe
                            that it would bring no good to the world we are struggling together
                            against an ideology and since many years we are the sentinels of the
                            struggle on the very frontier. At such an hour I had expected that a
                            message coming from a country with which we have a common destiny would
                            be different. Since 10:00 PM today Erenkoy (Kokkina) has been surrounded
                            by Greek forces and subjected to heavy firing. I had expected that given
                            this situation (the entire present situation) our American friends would
                            come and tell us that they regret that they have prevented in the past a
                            Turkish initiative and that they would say: ‘Now the decision is
                            yours.’</p>
                        <p>“This message, the message you have brought is addressed to our head of
                            state. We will, of course, convey this message to its high destination.
                            We will, of course, study it and evaluate it, bearing in mind its
                            importance and in the spirit of Turkish-American friendship. We shall
                            weigh carefully each word. During the time we have worked together I
                            have seen, Excellency, how much value you attach to Turkish-American
                            friendship and I know also your tireless efforts to promote this
                            friendship. I would like to thank you for the interest you have shown
                            for our national issue.</p>
                        <p>“Some one and half hours ago I have called in the Greek Ambassador. I
                            told him that we were holding the Greek Govt responsible for everything
                            that happened. I told him that we were definitely determined not to
                            allow the Greek Govt and its puppet in Cyprus to continue to undermine
                            the interests and prestige of the Turkish state.</p>
                        <p>“Seeing that these brutal actions in Gecitkala have not received any
                            reaction the Greeks do not any longer recognize the influence of any
                            authority and all of them by individual initiatives are attacking at any
                            occasion our innocent people. The Turkish Govt cannot condemn its
                            120,000 kinsmen to live like cattle while waiting their turn in a
                            slaughter house. I believe that from now on it's not what we want but
                            what God wants that will happen. This, Mr. Ambassador, is what I wanted
                            to tell you.” (It is interesting that there was no mention of Czech
                            arms.)</p>
                        <p>2. I commented that I much appreciated his remarks concerning my devotion
                            to Turkish-American friendship. I would continue to apply myself with
                            all my energies to furtherance of this relationship and to assistance in
                            finding some way out from fearful problem which Turkey faces today in
                            such manner as to avoid further loss of human life. I deeply admired
                            statesmanship and restraint shown by <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> in present crisis, <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0688"/>as well as his attitude and attitude of rest of govt
                            throughout last two years. Prospect of a war between two allies was a
                            nightmare for us all. It was in spirit of foregoing that President's
                            message should be read and understood. As I had indicated, messages had
                            been sent to King Constantine and to Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. These were strong messages.
                            Up to time these messages had been sent tremendous efforts had been
                            spent to stop patrolling in stricken villages of Cyprus and otherwise
                            ease situation by every means. Some progress being registered, as shown
                            by fact, still very secret, Grivas being recalled to Athens and due to
                            depart 2:00 AM or 10:00 AM today. We hoped very much his recall would be
                            permanent. Patrols also had been suspended temporarily and we hoped
                            suspensions could be made indefinite.</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil replied: “You have rightly referred to the prospect of a war
                            between two allies as a nightmare, but to go through this nightmare once
                            and for all is preferable to seeing a nightmare every night.” At this
                            point I felt Caglayangil was not being quite as serious as before.</p>
                        <p>I said that without trying just to have the last word I must say that he
                            and I both knew that a war would not be a nightmare for one night but
                            for an indefinite number of days and nights and with incalculable
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p> Caglayangil who had been very tense at start of meeting, appeared much
                            more relaxed as I left. He and I agreed I would refuse all comment to
                            press and I did so when they surrounded my car a few minutes later.<note n="4" xml:id="d311fn4">In telegram 2224 from Athens, November 20,

                        <p>2. In course of evening King had grown enthusiastic about this last idea.
                            I suggested that since I could not know how President would feel about
                            this suggestion or whether it would be realistic in relation to all
                            other considerations he must have in mind perhaps we could start by
                            exploring idea hypothetically. For example, could Greece accept not just
                            simple invitation but something suggesting specific direction of talks?
                            Earlier in evening, King had mentioned demilitarization of Cyprus. Turks
                            talking about removal of Greek forces before bilateral talks. Would it
                            be feasible for President, if he should extend invitation, to indicate
                            he understood Greece and presumably Turkey looking toward
                            demilitarization of Cyprus and was inviting their highest
                            representatives to talks on how to achieve this and other steps
                            necessary to resolve current difficulties and restore friendly
                            Greek-Turkish relations?</p>

                            difficulties but excused himself for few moments to consult PriMin and
                                <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>. On his return he said
                            government shared his feeling it would not be appropriate to have
                            agreement to demilitarization as a condition of meeting, which should be
                            called to discuss urgent issue of peace between Greece and Turkey.
                            However, acceptance of demilitarization would certainly be important
                            question for discussion, along with adjustment of treaty provisions
                            relating to unilateral intervention and other questions. He said again
                            that most of his Ministers and Chiefs of Staff want to get Greek forces
                            out of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>4. I promised to convey his ideas to Washington immediately. He hoped
                            that response could be prompt.</p>
                        <p>5. In absence of Canadian and British colleagues I made no reference to
                            Turkish ideas of basis for settlement that we expect to put to Foreign
                            Minister in morning. Perhaps phrasing can be found which will meet
                            Turkish minimum needs for indication for action before talks but also
                            get top level talks going rapidly.</p>

                            referring in particular to his oft repeated remarks desire see reduction
                            of military forces on island and indeed eventual demilitarization. Also
                            referred our <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0691"/>expressed desire
                            play useful role as non-aligned power and suggested he might add to his
                            stature as statesman by some timely action in keeping with his
                            acceptance speech of December 1959. At critical juncture in history of
                            Cyprus and of Greece and Turkey, if he could take initiative in calling
                            for reduction, if not elimination of military forces in Cyprus, he would
                            be making real contribution to defusing present crisis which of utmost
                            gravity and at same time make significant contribution to overall
                            settlement of Cyprus problem. I then gave him text describing draft
                            message as combination State Department and Embassy thinking which I had
                            no time to clear with Washington and therefore had no official USG
                            status but was merely an effort put down some thoughts which might be
                            useful if he considered concept our suggestion valuable.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> commented that we
                            were correct in our assumption that he favored demilitarization through
                            a phased reduction of forces but that for him to take the initiative
                            without reference to Athens was out of the question. He said he
                            personally would have no hesitation in telling me that he agreed with
                            the concept and indeed the text of the proposed message. However in view
                            of present crisis and state of public opinion both here and in Greece,
                            he feared he would be accused of being a traitor and selling out Greece.
                            I attempted argue that a private and confidential message of this sort
                            might actually assist Greece in reaching decision regarding reply to
                            Turkish note. The injection of a statesmanlike suggestion such as this
                            at this time might have most significant bearing on outcome of crisis.
                            He agreed but again said he could not take initiative. Archbishop then
                            said he could, however, respond affirmatively to any Greek initiative
                            along these lines and asked that we consider making presentation in
                            Athens along lines mine to him. I said I would pass his observations
                            back to Department and to Embassy Athens and I assumed I would hear
                            something further which I would then communicate later today or this
                            evening. In meantime I urged him give further thought to our proposal.
                            He replied that he intended discuss it with <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> and in event of any change in his view as
                            result these discussions, he would call me.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> I think significant point to come out
                            of somewhat discouraging conversation is that Makarios and his
                            government would not only oppose reduction and eventual withdrawal of
                            Greek forces, and indeed further steps toward demilitarization, but that
                            he willing respond affirmatively to any possible GOG proposals along
                            lines reftel. Realize that initiative along these lines in Athens would
                            complicate if not counter efforts now being made there on wider concept
                            of Turk five points. However, certainly in event Greek rejection present
                            tripartite initiative, foregoing could conceivably be used as next move
                            in our efforts avoid conflict. Prior to seeing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> discussed proposed approach

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> commented that first
                            three Turkish points were acceptable to him if accepted by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. Speaking to me he remarked that as he
                            had said earlier today (Nicosia 710)<note n="4" xml:id="d314fn4">
                                <ref target="#d313">Document 313</ref>.</note> he was in favor of
                            complete demilitarization including removal of Greek and Turk
                            contingents. He went on to say that presence of any foreign military
                            troops would be source of constant friction and suspicion and therefore
                            would be best include them in withdrawal as well. <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>er remarked that for time being
                            perhaps Turks would feel their contingent's presence required in order
                            give some sense of additional security to Turkish community. I remarked
                            that this aspect of course could be included as one of items to be
                            discussed further as suggested in last paragraph of document which
                            Canadian <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>er had given him.</p>
                        <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0693"/>
                        <p>3. After first saying that if five points acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> he could accept also, Archbishop
                            expressed reservations with regard (D) and (E) which he felt were
                            matters purely concerning the GOC. He would require time to discuss
                            these two points with his Ministers. He said he would call in Greek
                            Ambassador Alexandrakis for further discussion of five points. I
                            reminded him that these five points and numerous other aspects of
                            problem had been discussed at great length in Ankara by our three
                            colleagues and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> representatives.
                            These had emerged as basic points in Turkish position. They had been
                            presented today noon by our three colleagues in Athens to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Pipinelis who had said he would
                            refer them at once to Greek Cabinet. I doubted whether Alexandrakis
                            would have word as yet although at some point hopefully very soon, there
                            would be some consultation, at least on last two points. I said that we
                            would be informing Athens at once of his favorable views on reduction of
                            forces covered in points (2) and (3) and I felt sure this would be major
                            factor to be taken into consideration by Greek Cabinet in reaching its
                            decision. Speed was of the utmost importance at this most critical time
                            and he could be assured we would send this word by the fastest possible
                            means.</p>

                            between Greece and Turkey could not go further into ultimate solution
                            without involvement of GOC at early date.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> saw me 9:30 AM
                            (local). As expected, however, he reiterated his position as set forth
                            Nicosia 710<note n="3" xml:id="d315fn3">
                                <ref target="#d13">Document 13</ref>.</note> that he could not get
                            out in front by sending unilateral message. I then urged him consider
                            proposing to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> that joint message be
                            sent. This would avoid either King or <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> being singled out as one who “sold out
                            Hellenism”. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' initial
                            reaction was that this idea had merit. He wondered if message might be
                            sent by himself and King jointly to UNSYG who then could take further
                            action on it. I said that such a proposal could well fit in with
                            presence of Rolz-Bennett in Ankara later today. If offer inherent in
                            proposed text could be made to U Thant as response <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s appeal and then forwarded by him to
                            Rolz-Bennett in Ankara, latter might be able make excellent use of it in
                            his conversations with Turks. This might well be instrument for defusing
                            situation and getting Turk finger off the button.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> asked if I thought
                            presence of high-level emissaries in Ankara might result in defusing
                            situation. I had feared <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> and
                            Rolz-Bennett Missions might be seized upon by him as excuse for further
                            procrastination. I am sure this is what was in his mind. I told him in
                            very strong terms that we convinced all they could do was buy some time
                            by their presence and that Turks would require some sort of response
                            from Greeks. I said we convinced that reduction of armed confrontation
                            on island was central to their basic position as set forth in five
                                points.<note n="4" xml:id="d315fn4">See <ref target="#d314fn3">footnote 3, Document 314</ref>.</note> If no move made at least
                            in this direction, I could see no hope in situation. Since he accepted
                            in principle concept set forth in proposed message and King accepted in
                            principle and since concept of demilitarization encompassed points two
                            and three of Turk five points, surely sensible thing to do at this stage
                            was to move along these lines. He said he would have to consult his
                            advisers and I asked him notify me perhaps through <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> as soon as possible since time
                            was of the essence. Also offered transmit any message for him if this
                            would facilitate matter.</p>
                        <p>3. I immediately called on <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>
                            and Alexandrakis and made similar presentation and believe have won
                            their support. Also tried impress on both of them need for swift action
                            in order take advantage Rolz-Bennett presence Ankara. Alexandrakis had
                            one important modification to suggest in proposal. He believes that
                            message if agreed to by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and his government should be from <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> rather than from King. He fears that public
                            reaction in Greece to message would be very adverse and he did not want
                            to risk institution of monarchy in this connection. As he put it, we can
                            sacrifice <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> in the interests
                            of peace but not the King.</p>

                                Turkey of its interest in a speedy and effective mutual
                                demilitarization. (Ibid.)</note> For the Secretary from Tablot.</p>
                        <p>1. With all respect, another way to stop war is for Turkey not to start
                            it. I do not now comment on specific plan suggested reftel, which I
                            assume being studied in Ottawa, London, and Washington, but rather on
                            general idea that only way to keep peace is for Greece to meet Turkey's
                            terms within hours.</p>
                        <p>2. For full week now Turkey has been bullying Greeks to accept
                            capitulation on an issue that all sides now believe could be resolved by
                            negotiation not under gun. In process, Turkish actions and demands have
                            engaged maximum energies of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>,
                            British, Canadians, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and now
                            UNSYG. Virtually total resources of major Western powers and
                            international organizations created since World War II to provide
                            alternatives to war for settlement of international disputes are now
                            available to Turkey and Greece. If wrongs have been committed by Greek
                            and Cypriot forces (and they have), Turkey has access to full panoply of
                            international machinery for redress. If in these circumstances it
                            nonetheless concludes that its case can be carried only by its own
                            military power, case must be weak indeed. Especially as in present
                            circumstances Turkey has no treaty justification for military action in
                            another sovereign country, since Article 4 of Treaty of Guarantee which
                            Turkey usually cites authorizes unilateral action only in absence of
                            common or concerted action, which certainly is now occurring and could
                            be complete if Turkey itself would join.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>I well understand Turkish rationale for present course is “Turkish
                            honor.” When in history of aggression has national honor not been reason
                            advanced for military attack on another country? One week ago Greece
                            through Grivas-led Cyprus National Guard attack had lost any claim to
                            international support of its position. Today I suspect Turkey by its
                            tactics has raised doubts in many governments about justness of its
                            cause. Has not time come to make this fact plain to Turks?</p>
                        <p>Knowing importance of our interests and delicacy of current relations
                            with Turkey, I am full of admiration for way Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> has been handling task which
                            substantially more difficult than mine here. Nonetheless, I hope
                            instructions given Vance Mission will permit him to make forceful case
                            to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> that this dispute must now be
                            committed to international machinery designed to deal with threats of
                            war. Against this, who can argue that there is excuse for escalation to
                            war actions whose inescapable result would be killing of many more Turk
                            Cypriots than have yet been casualties of communal strike on Cyprus, not
                            to mention anticipated Turk and Greek casualties and other costs?</p>

                                to Athens, November 23, instructed <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> to suggest to the King that Greece
                                immediately offer to withdraw 500 troops from Cyprus and indicate
                                its readiness to discuss further withdrawals. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. I called on King at 1200 local just before meeting convened at Palace
                            of “little Cabinet” (<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, FinMin,
                            5 military Ministers) and outlined points in paras 2 and 3 reftel. King
                            grimaced at idea of recalling Greek military personnel under heat of
                            Turkish military pressure. I suggested <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> initiative, if it forthcoming as we now
                            urgently recommending,<pb n="659" xml:id="pg_659" facs="0697"/> ought
                            give good basis for Greek token withdrawal as earnest of good will.
                            Discussion revealed Royal firmness on point that any Greek action would
                            have to be matched by comparable Turkish de-escalation action. I came
                            away with impression that if Vance can get Turkish pledge of some
                            visible pullback we can expect to be able to persuade Greeks to order
                            withdrawal of some troops. However, in matters such as these King both
                            influences Ministers and is influenced by them. I may be able to get
                            better reading of Greek mood today after Cabinet meeting.</p>
                        <p>2. I have impression mood developing in Palace and “little Cabinet” to go
                            for complete demilitarization of Cyprus as part of settlement this
                            crisis if war avoided. In [King?] says military Ministers now tending to
                            want to get rid of Greek and Turkish contingents as well as all forces
                            put on island since 1963. In their developing view, internal security
                            could then be maintained either by reinforced <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> or by merging Cypriot National
                            Guard and Turkish-Cypriot military and paramilitary units into single
                            national Cyprus force.</p>
                        <p>3. I mentioned <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> concern over
                            protection of minorities in Greece and Turkey as tensions heightened.
                            King immediately suggested Greece would welcome American or other
                            international observers during period of crisis in areas where Turkish
                            ethnics congregated, on assumption Turkey would offer similar
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>4. I also noted importance of obtaining from <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> assurance that Greeks will not initiate military action
                            during period of discussions, and said I had already communicated his
                            pledge that there would be no preemptive strike by Greek forces.
                            “Never”, he replied.</p>

                        <p>74061. Literally eyes only for the Ambassador from the Secretary. I wish
                            to express to each of you my deep appreciation for the round-the-clock
                                <pb n="660" xml:id="pg_660" facs="0698"/>effort you have been making
                            to avoid catastrophe over the Cyprus question. I need not emphasize the
                            scope of the catastrophe for all of us and for <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> if Turkey and Greece should get into a war with each
                            other. What we should keep in mind is that such an event would mean that
                            our bilateral relations with both countries would approach zero for the
                            foreseeable future. Therefore, in dealing with your host country about
                            these issues, you should concentrate on what your host country can do to
                            prevent war and not be unduly worried about whether subsequent bilateral
                            relations will be as comfortable as you would hope. Each one of you
                            should concentrate on how you can persuade your own host government to
                            make a maximum effort to preserve the peace. The stakes are such that
                            the future of our bilateral relations is secondary to the prevention of
                            hostilities between Greece and Turkey. My colleagues back here could
                            write memoranda explaining why this is not necessarily so. Indeed, I
                            admit that I have in mind certain irrational factors which ought not to
                            be there. But the events themselves and the predictable reactions of the
                            American people and the American Congress will take the play away from
                            us diplomats. We need not apologize to any of your host governments for
                            the harshest pressures we may put on in the interest of maintaining
                            peace. The issues in Cyprus itself are, strictly from the point of view
                            of the US national interest, trivial compared to peace between Greece
                            and Turkey. Our responsibility is to support that central US national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>My personal regards to all three of you. The President and I are grateful
                            for your dedicated effort in these trying moments.</p>

                        <p>1. I have completed my first round of talks in Ankara with President

                                (Ibid.)</note>
                            <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0699"/>Throughout the Turks maintained
                            a consistently hard position which apparently reflects a concerted
                            Cabinet decision.</p>
                        <p>2. While the dangers of a military confrontation are acute, none of us
                            believe the Turks will attack while my mission remains in the area,
                            thus, we probably have some time to try to find an effective handle to
                            this problem but the grip is short.</p>
                        <p>3. The Turks are clearly in a dangerous, fatalistic mood. After four
                            years of what they consider to have [garble] painful salami tactics on
                            Cyprus, they claim they will pay no more. The situation is described in
                            simplistic terms of Greek illegality and villainy and Turkish suffering.
                            They assert that their honor is at stake, and popular passions in the
                            country are so high that a catalytic explosion is in the offing. The
                            only possible way out, in their opinion, is a virtually immediate Greek
                            decision to commence withdrawing its “illegal” military units on
                            Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>4. This is heady stuff. Yet, throughout we were received with courtesy
                            and friendship. Beneath the harsh description of the imperatives of the
                            situation we sense a Turkish hope that we can pull a rabbit out of the
                            essentially ultimative hat they have presented to us. This is going to
                            take some doing but we are still in the ball game.</p>

                            Minister Pipinellis November 24. Secretary Vance, accompanied by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> and John Walsh,
                            had lengthy discussion with Foreign Minister Pipinellis this morning.
                            Throughout conversation Pipinellis was courteous, calm, thoughtful, and
                            somewhat fatalistic.</p>
                        <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0700"/>
                        <p>In response to Pipinellis' inquiry, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> frankly outlined his impression of the mood and
                            position of the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and the Turkish
                            people. He summarized situation as very grave with war fever running and
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> flatly insisting on immediate
                            withdrawal of illegal Greek forces as sine qua non for easing of
                            tensions. He pointed out that he had been rebuffed when he suggested
                            that solution might be found in simultaneous Greek withdrawal and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> steps to lower mobilization levels.
                            While some moderate forces exist within <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, he was uncertain whether they could withstand mounting
                            war pressures.</p>
                        <p> Pipinellis said he was not surprised by <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s assessment. Greece and her allies were faced by
                            gravest dangers. All Greek information pointed to probability of Turk
                            attack. He had taken position as Foreign Minister determined to find
                            peaceful solution but not at the price of national humiliation. What
                            Turkey asks, he said, no self-respecting government could accept. They
                            wish Greece to give up all its assets before talking. If Greek forces
                            are withdrawn from Cyprus, he predicted communal clashes would occur
                            followed by a Turkish landing. Turkey would then exercise its will
                            without hindrance on Cyprus. If clash with Turkey is unavoidable, he
                            preferred it to occur under existing circumstances. Despite his
                            conviction that Greek forces are factor of stability on island and their
                            elimination would create vacuum inviting Turkish intervention, he was
                            prepared consider phased withdrawal connected with establishment of some
                            other type policing force, providing Turks would accept formula which
                            would not humiliate Greece. This, he said, is all Greece can do. If it
                            is not acceptable to Turkey, situation is hopeless.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> then turned to possibility
                            of solution to impasse if U Thant issued call to Greeks to start
                            withdrawing and to Turks to take action reduce tensions. He felt this
                            plan could prevent war without humiliation and stated he authorized to
                            inform Pipinellis that UKG shared this view. Greeks would respond first
                            to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and then Turks would respond.
                            Under this plan <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would provide
                            umbrella protecting dignity each country. In eyes of world, Greece would
                            benefit if it responded first to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.
                            Furthermore, chances of peaceful settlement are slight unless Greece
                            moves first, since <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has presented
                            complete stonewall when we raised possibility simultaneity in decisions
                            both countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> pointed out that his
                            proposal had not been discussed as yet with U Thant but he would raise
                            it with his Special Representative Rolz-Bennett, if Pipinellis
                            considered plan had merit.</p>
                        <p> Pipinellis responded that idea appeared reasonable, but felt <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would require at least simultaneity in
                            notifications to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and timing of
                            commencement of specific actions. Furthermore, there would be no Greek
                            withdrawal from Cyprus unless Turks withdraw. Movement outwards must be
                            on staged basis and accompanied by build-up of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or other replacement forces. Ensuing discussion
                            indicated Pipinellis <pb n="663" xml:id="pg_663" facs="0701"/>unaware
                            numbers of Greek and Turkish illegal forces on island and apparently
                            assumed approximate equality these forces. He emphasized that principle
                            of complete withdrawal must be accepted by both sides. This should not
                            be linked, however, to London-Zurich Accords because of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p> Pipinellis said he would work out written statement for consideration
                            with <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> in afternoon and
                            subsequently with Cabinet.</p>
                        <p>He then summed up his views by saying he was prepared to go far in search
                            for peace but he would not yield to Turkish pressure. If Turks not
                            prepared make slightest gesture of understanding feelings of a free
                            people, war will result. Finally, any Turk landing on Cyprus would
                            speedily escalate into full war between Greece and Turkey.<note n="2" xml:id="d320fn2">Following the meeting with <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, Pipinellis submitted a draft

                        <p>2410. <gloss target="#t_Vanto1">Vanto</gloss> 16. For Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MNRS1">McNamara</persName>. In the course of a busy day I have met with
                            King Constantine, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName>, Foreign Minister Pipinellis, and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special Representative, Rolz-Bennett. I
                            have found in Athens none of the raucous war hysteria which prevails in
                            Ankara. There is no evidence of panic by the people or the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, the Greek Government remains cool and determined as the
                            war clouds thicken. They have a real desire to find a peaceful solution
                            to the crisis. The King again today reaffirmed his commitment that there
                            would be no preventive military actions by Greek forces. The Greek
                            Government has also accepted certain military risks in limiting military
                            call-ups and military movements in order to avoid provocation of the
                            Turks and exciting the populace. They have leaned over backwards in an
                            effort to formulate a proposition for me to convey to the Turks tomorrow
                                <pb n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0702"/>which would be compatible
                            with Greek national dignity and Turkish demands for Greek troop
                            withdrawals. I could not ask them to do more. Signed <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, accompanied by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> and John Walsh,
                            met with Foreign Minister Caglayangil to discuss results of mission's
                            discussions in Athens. Implications of meeting were ugly. Caglayangil
                            was churlish in manner and cavalier in his comments on various aspects
                            of the mission's proposals. It was difficult to avoid conclusion during
                            meeting that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had been tricked into a
                            Turkish charade <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0703"/>which would
                            come to an abrupt end at Turkish National Security Council meeting
                            scheduled later in morning. As Caglayangil left for <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting, he told Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> that our proposals were
                            hopeless.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> opened session with
                            description his activities in Athens, including problems persuading
                            Greeks to agree to formulation which would satisfy Turk demands that
                            Greeks take initiative in accepting proposal plea by YG [<hi rend="italic">SYG</hi>?] and in beginning withdrawal Greek units.
                            After considerable persuasion this had been accomplished in form of

                        </p>
                        <p>After glancing at documents presented by <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> and briefly discussing them with his FonOff
                            colleagues, Caglayangil's subsequent comments quickly chilled the
                            atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> products were not, he
                            said, as good as the five points presented by the US–<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>-Can Ambassadors.<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">See <ref target="#d314">Document 314</ref>.</note>
                            In his opinion, they seemed to represent an effort to save Greek
                            prestige without regard for Turkish prestige. The provision for total
                            demilitarization was unacceptable to him because it conflicted with the
                            London/Zurich Accords establishing fixed levels for Greek and Turkish
                            contingents. The interrelation between paras and the balanced
                            relationship between Greek and Turkish actions seemed incomprehensible
                            to him. Furthermore the Pipinellis side note to Vance cited above was
                            surprisingly described as a Greek ultimatum. When Vance proposed to
                            clarify individual points Caglayangil opined that it might be helpful
                            but would not change his assessment that <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> proposals were not acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Speaking in a more general sense, he launched series of rockets. Turkey,
                            he said, is not faced with simple choice of peace or war. If at present
                            acute phase of crisis, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is unable
                            safeguard its kinsmen on Cyprus the damage to its social structure will
                            far exceed costs of war. Country would collapse in anarchy if people
                            lost confidence in army and government.</p>
                        <p>Evidently responding to yesterday's strictures by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> that a Turkish war decision would
                            seriously affect US-Turkish relations, he said he did not share this
                            point of view. Nobody with sound mind would be shocked by Turkish use of
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> equipment against ally after the
                            events of November 14–15. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>
                            responded vigorously at this point, outlining inevitable American
                            reactions to such an event.</p>
                        <p>After Caglayangil's departure for Cabinet meeting, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> requested FonOff pass message to
                            him requesting urgent meeting with President <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sunay</persName> and informing Caglayangil that, if Cabinet took
                            decision <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0704"/>turn down <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> proposals, <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> would conclude it had been tricked by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and entire exercise had been Turkish
                            charade. This resulted in quick response that President would see Vance
                            at 1230 today.</p>

                        <p>770. 1. I hesitated use this precedence for following message but it will
                            give you all some indication what we are up against in dealing with
                            Byzantine mentality so prevalent in GOC.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> called me to Palace
                            8:00 P.M. local. Foreign Minister was present. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said that they had
                            information to indicate that Caglayangil had made what purported be
                            serious proposal: <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would land troops
                            in Cyprus but with no intention open hostilities unless opposed. Their
                            idea would be to secure a beachhead and hold it and then negotiate from
                            a position of greater equality vis-à-vis Greece and Cyprus. President
                            wanted me to know and get word to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            that such an action would be considered an act of war and would of
                            course be opposed with whatever forces GOC could muster.</p>
                        <p>2. I told the Archbishop that we had had similar information but from
                            military contacts and not from anyone in authority on the civilian side
                            of the government and we had already commented from this Embassy that
                            such a hope on the part of the Turks was out of the question. He asked
                            nevertheless to report this information and to make clear the position
                            of his government.</p>
                        <p>3. Our discussion then turned to the <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> Mission and the central theme of demilitarization.
                            I reminded His Beatitude of our conversation when the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Canadian <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>ers were present the other night<note n="2" xml:id="d323fn2">Reported in telegram 699 from Nicosia, November 21.
                                (Ibid., POL 27 CYP)</note> at which time I had said that I doubted
                            very much whether the Turks would be willing to go the whole way and
                            remove their contingent. I understood that the Greek position was
                            similar to his and that they both supported complete demilitarization
                            and the removal of the contingent was <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0705"/>an integral part of this concept. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> interjected that unless the
                            Turks could agree to removal of their contingent, the whole proposition
                            was hopeless. I turned to the Archbishop saying that his words to me the
                            other day were graphic in describing the situation as not merely one of
                            war or peace but rather one of peace or survival. This being the case
                            would it not be better for the time being to accept a limited
                            demilitarization which would involve the removal of non-Cypriot forces
                            in excess to the London/Zurich treaty levels? Surely this was a question
                            which could be decided in the talks which must take place subsequent to
                            settlement of the present grave crisis. The modification of
                            London/Zurich would be central to any such talks—even the Turks agreed
                            to this. For the sake of preserving peace could this aspect of the
                            problem not be postponed? Both the Archbishop and <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said this was out of the
                            question.</p>
                        <p>4. Our conversation then turned to other aspects of the Turkish five
                            points with emphasis on internal security. We discussed at some length
                            the problem of policing and whether there would be joint <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-Greek and Turkish patrols. I had the
                            strange feeling of being somewhere else engrossed in
                            [garble—irrelevancies?] while the central point of avoiding war was
                            being argued. I could not seem to impress upon them their fate hung in
                            the balance no matter how many times I tried to bring the conversation
                            back to the central issue.</p>
                        <p>5. As I took my leave I reminded them that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s first conversations in Ankara had been
                            discouraging and that we were now awaiting a report of his conversations
                            with President <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sunay</persName>. In response
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' question I assumed
                            the reason Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> was not
                            coming here at the present time was that the Turks had not accepted the
                            Greek position as he had presented it after his consultations in Athens
                            yesterday. I reminded him that I did not know any of the details except
                            that the Turks had objected to the removal of the two contingents but
                            that I would try to keep him informed if we learned of any other points
                            of issue. In the meantime, what was needed was a miracle and I wished
                            them good luck in finding one.</p>
                        <p>6. For the first time in my five years of knowing Makarios he was using
                            his worry beads (I might add that the Foreign Minister and I had ours
                            out too!).</p>

                            met with Foreign Minister Caglayangil late afternoon. By end of one and
                            one-half hours frank exchanges, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> had obtained <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>

                            has no illusions about capacity <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> government to place spanner in works, it has
                            impression after long and hard day with Turks that they may have turned
                            the corner in a policy sense in the direction of trying to obtain
                            peace.</p>

                            and manner shifted dramatically. In morning session he verged on
                            rudeness and ugliness, with much dark muttering about potential collapse
                            of Turkish society unless war decision were made. At productive noon
                            session with President Sunay he said nothing. In late afternoon he was
                            again courteous and friendly, speaking of desire for peace,

                            that it reflects the personal intervention of President <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Sunay</persName> and the weight of persistent U.S.

                            may be a growing belief in GOT that arrangements short of war can be
                            made for departure Greek forces. While not sanguine about final results,
                            we remain hopeful.<note n="4" xml:id="d324fn4">Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> transmitted a summary of

                            but it was his judgment that their draft could not be sold to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. With time running out, it is
                            imperative to minimize textual changes. With this thought in mind he had
                            prepared draft which represents fair balance between desires of two
                            countries and which has reasonable chance of acceptance in Ankara. Text
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>“1. The Secretary General of the United Nations would address an appeal
                            to the Governments of Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, such an appeal to
                            include, inter alia:</p>
                        <p>a. An invitation to the Governments of Turkey and Greece to reaffirm the
                            independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>b. A request that the Governments of Turkey and Greece take immediate
                            steps to remove any threat to the security of each other and of Cyprus
                            and as a first step along the line of my previous appeal to bring about
                            an expeditious withdrawal of Greek and Turkish forces, in excess of
                            those present in 1963.</p>
                        <p>2. The Governments of Greece and Turkey would declare their readiness to
                            comply forthwith with the appeal of the Secretary General.</p>
                        <p>3. Thereupon the Greek Government will withdraw expeditiously its
                            military forces from Cyprus. Accompanying this, the Turkish Government
                            will take all the necessary measures for removing the crisis.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to the appeal of the Secretary General, the three
                            countries undertake to seek from the Security Council an enlarged and
                                <pb n="670" xml:id="pg_670" facs="0708"/>improved mandate for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> giving it an increased
                            pacification role and calling upon it to assist in setting up
                            expeditiously new practical arrangements for the safeguarding of
                            internal security (including the safety of all citizens) and the
                            supervision of disarmament.”</p>
                        <p>3. In explaining text, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>
                            emphasized that his object was to stop outbreak of war and not to solve
                            all problems of Cyprus. Therefore, text could not be as inclusive as
                            either party might wish. On other hand, text seems fair to both and
                            could provide medium for resolution present crisis.</p>
                        <p>4. After discussion number elements of <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> draft, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said it would not be feasible to reassemble
                            the Cabinet to review paper before <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s departure. He then proposed a “gentlemen's
                            agreement.” <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> should present
                            the Greek draft to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> tomorrow. If it
                            is rejected, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> should then
                            present his draft. If Turk concurrence is obtained, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> pledged himself to support the
                            draft in Cabinet. He also authorized <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> to inform <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> that
                            he had reasonable confidence that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            would approve the draft.</p>
                        <p>5. In discussing <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> plans for reduction
                            mobilization levels, Pipinelis said <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            placed high priority on removal invasion fleet which had been assembled
                            in Turk ports and would like to obtain letter from <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> covering reduction schedules comparable
                            to their letter on withdrawal schedules. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said he would urge <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to provide such a letter.</p>

                        <p>2589. <gloss target="#t_Vanto1">Vanto</gloss> 33. Subj: <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> meeting with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil—November 27.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, accompanied by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName> and John Walsh,
                            met at 0800 with <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil
                            and <persName corresp="#p_TI1">Turkmen</persName>. Although speaking in
                            somewhat bewildering rococo style, Caglayangil was courteous and
                            friendly throughout the two-hour session. Vance opened the substantive
                            section of the talks by conveying to Caglayangil the deep <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0709"/>appreciation of Greek Foreign Minister
                            Pipinellis for the personal message from Caglayangil.<note n="2" xml:id="d326fn2">See <ref target="#d325fn2">footnote 2, Document
                                    325</ref>.</note> He then said that he had discussed with
                            Pipinellis the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> concern about the
                            schedule for Greek force removals. In an effort to meet this problem,
                            Pipinellis had written letter to <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> containing a specific schedule which would move
                            all Greek forces in excess of London-Zurich levels within a three-month
                            period. He had authorized <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> to
                            pass this letter to Caglayangil.<note n="3" xml:id="d326fn3">Not
                                found.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having established a favorable frame of reference, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> then turned over a document
                            containing the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>'s formulation of a
                            draft accord, which he had received from Pipinellis on the previous
                                evening.<note n="4" xml:id="d326fn4">Quoted in <ref target="#d325">Document 325</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>After carefully reading the document, Caglayangil said he would take it
                            to his government. He went on to say that Greece and Turkey were faced
                            with two problems, the Cyprus question and the crisis born out of that
                            question. In the past hectic week the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, aided by the US, had tried to resolve the crisis and
                            had not wished to bog down in the vast ramifications of the Cyprus
                            question. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> had convinced him
                            that, while the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had not given an
                            ultimatum, world opinion believed that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had cornered Greece.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> had found an ingenious way
                            out in the form of a response to an appeal from the SYG. This idea would
                            have solved the crisis. Greece could have reacted positively,
                            contributing to an eventual atmosphere in which the basic question of
                            Cyprus could have been solved. However, the Greek document is designed
                            to show the public that the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has
                            renounced the London/Zurich Accords, thus prejudging the Cyprus
                            question. This is unacceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In response, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said that when
                            he first came to the area he had felt that it would be wise to let the
                            parties find a solution within the concept of an appeal by the Secretary
                            General. In a sense, he had acted as a postman.</p>
                        <p>After reading the Greek draft last evening, it was clear to him that it
                            would not be acceptable to the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. He
                            felt the time had come for him to synthesize the ideas of both sides.
                            The object of the document which he had prepared was to solve the
                            immediate problem, and to leave to future negotiations the overall
                            problem of Cyprus.<note n="5" xml:id="d326fn5">The <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> draft was transmitted in
                                    <gloss target="#t_Vanto1">Vanto</gloss> 34 from Ankara, November
                                27. (Department of State, Central Files, POL 7 US/<persName corresp="#p_VC1">VANCE</persName>)</note> He could contribute
                            little to the solution of that complex issue.</p>
                        <p>While largely based on the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> draft of
                            November 25, it does not include certain elements included in the Greek
                            and Turk drafts. It is, <pb n="672" xml:id="pg_672" facs="0710"/>however, a fair and honorable formulation which, if approved, would
                            resolve the immediate crisis.</p>
                        <p>In response to Caglayangil's question, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had
                            [garble—not?] seen the draft text presented to him but he has discussed
                            the concept in the draft with the Greek Foreign Minister. Vance said he
                            believed there was a reasonable chance that it would be accepted by the
                            Greeks and he would bring all his energy to bear on the Greeks if the
                            text were accepted by the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of certain clarifying comments by <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, Caglayangil said he could easily
                            discuss <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s draft and would
                            take it promptly to the Prime Minister and to the Cabinet. However, he
                            was troubled by the Greek three month time table.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said the important thing is
                            the written Greek commitment to withdraw. Since it takes time to move
                            troops, a three-month broad schedule was not unreasonable. When
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> asked what the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> schedule was for reducing the
                            mobilization rate, Caglayangil stated there is no time-table. However,
                            if the Greeks begin to withdraw, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            could return to the November 15 levels immediately.</p>
                        <p>President and Prime Minister have been meeting with party leaders. We
                            will not receive any word before 2000 local.</p>

                        <p>75051. Tovan 30.</p>
                        <p>1. We have hesitated to offer any specific comments re tactics your
                            negotiations on assumption those officers on spot who are advising you
                            are in position best fulfill this function.</p>
                        <p>2. As we follow evolution of draft proposal however we are impressed with
                            extent to which ultimate success your mission could <pb n="673" xml:id="pg_673" facs="0711"/>depend on reaction in Nicosia in view
                            built-in veto <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> might
                            have by declining join proposed tripartite approach to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. We unaware whether you have discussed
                            this <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> problem with
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>3. For what it may be worth as supplement to what you may have heard and
                            may hear, consensus here among officers experienced Cyprus affairs, is
                            that even if you go to island with draft omitting express reference to
                            London-Zurich and without direct reference to Turkish contingent you
                            will not be able avoid substantive discussion with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in which it will presumably
                            become clear to him that settlement envisaged will include continuance
                            Turkish contingent on island and Turkish insistence on validity
                            London-Zurich agreements.</p>
                        <p>Belief here is that in such situation <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> can be expected either reject proposal outright
                            or attempt finesse by counter proposals. Unless Greek Cypriots have been
                            intimidated by assigning high degree credibility danger Turkish attack,
                            which appears not to be case, officers here consider <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> likely will continue rely on
                            his basic assets, namely, (a) status of Cyprus as sovereign independent
                            state with all that implies; (b) membership in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> giving <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            access to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> organs for protection; (c) psychological ties with
                            Greece which can be exploited to inhibit action by GOG in connection
                            such matters as unilateral withdrawal Greek forces from Cyprus over
                            opposition of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <p>4. There arises accordingly question whether tactics can be developed to
                            deter <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> from reverting to
                            his classic waltz around ring tightly clutching the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Only approach which has occurred to us
                            is based on premise <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            more likely attempt torpedo or evade your proposal if he is in doubt
                            about ultimate political consequences than if he has fairly clear idea
                            where it would lead. If he can be persuaded that political situation
                            beyond your immediate proposal would be satisfactory from his standpoint
                            he may be willing accept proposal. Our thought is that you might discuss
                            this aspect of the problem frankly with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and refer to Declaration of Reconciliation<note n="2" xml:id="d327fn2">Reference is to a proposed appeal by the U.N.
                                Secretary-General to the involved parties.</note> as type of
                            settlement which would appear possible in near future and which would
                            establish political environment in which GOC, its officials, and its
                            people could prosper, politically, economically, and socially.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> would have
                            coordinated this ahead of time with Canadian Ambassador, and you would
                            say Declaration is Canadian proposal.</p>

                            presented to the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> on an “accept it or
                            accept war” basis. This paper is final Turkish position which you will
                            note rejects most of my draft.</p>
                        <p>2. We have grave doubt Greeks will agree to this document. Even if they
                            do paragraph #4 as insisted upon by Turks does not provide basis for SYG
                            to act unless three countries agree to paragraph #4 and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> would agree. In addition time
                            running out and if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> did
                            not agree within very short period of time Turks may move. We are trying
                            to find some way around this problem but have no answer yet. Perhaps
                                <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> could issue appeal based on
                            points 1, 2, and 3 of current draft and act unilaterally along lines of
                            paragraph #4 of draft Vance presented to Turks which was rejected. This
                            would take great courage on part of SYG and would carry risk that it
                            would not be accepted by Turks who already have rejected it, or by
                            Cypriots. (Request flash comments of Department and Goldberg.) Will
                            continue to seek better alternative.</p>
                        <p>3. In addition Turks rejected Greek time table and have insisted on total
                            withdrawal within 45 days. (Text of pertinent Caglayangil letter to me
                            is attached.) We do not know whether Greeks can swallow this.</p>
                        <p>4. Plan to meet with Greek Foreign Minister immediately on arrival. Then
                            plan to see Rolz-Bennett to get his views and help.</p>
                        <p>5. As result of last night's session which will be reported in detail in
                            cable to follow we have question as to <persName corresp="#p_DS1">Demirel</persName>'s ability to control his Cabinet. He appeared
                            shaken and under great strain. We were informed he was turned down on
                            more than one occasion in urging acceptance by Turks of some of points
                            in <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> draft.</p>
                        <p>Text of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> draft accord handed <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> Nov 28 as follows:</p>
                        <p>“1. The Secretary General of the United Nations would address an appeal
                            to the Governments of Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, such an appeal to
                            include:</p>
                        <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0713"/>
                        <p>A request that the Governments of Turkey and Greece take immediate steps
                            to remove any threat to the security of each other and of Cyprus and as
                            a first step along the lines of the Secretary General's previous appeal
                            to bring about an expeditious withdrawal of those forces in excess of
                            the Turkish and Greek contingents.</p>
                        <p>2. The Governments of Greece and Turkey would declare their readiness to
                            comply forthwith with the appeal of the Secretary General.</p>
                        <p>3. Thereupon the Greek Government would withdraw expeditiously its
                            military forces and military personnel and equipment from Cyprus.
                            Accompanying this, the Turkish Government will take all the necessary
                            measures for removing the crisis.</p>
                        <p>4. In response to the appeal of the Secretary General, there should be an
                            enlarged and improved mandate for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> giving it an increased pacification role, which
                            would include supervision of disarmament of all forces constituted after
                            1963 and new practical arrangements for the safeguarding of internal
                            security including the safety of all citizens.”</p>
                        <p>6. Following accompanying letter dated Nov 28 from <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil also given <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>:</p>
                        <p>Recognizing the great importance of reducing tensions between Greece and
                            Turkey expeditiously, it is suggested that the proposed timetable for
                            the withdrawal of the Greek forces contained in the letter of the Greek
                            Foreign Minister to you be reduced from three months to 45 days. It is
                            also stressed that this withdrawal should take place in a continuing
                            process and carried out in good faith.</p>
                        <p>On its part the Government of Turkey will take in parallel all the
                            necessary measures for reducing the crisis. This means that with the
                            commencement of the withdrawal of Greek forces the Government of Turkey
                            will stand down the current state of readiness of its forces, and in
                            parallel with further Greek withdrawals will reduce the military
                            preparedness of its forces to levels in effect prior to November 15,
                            1967.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>—November 28.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, accompanied by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> and John Walsh, called
                            on <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> at 1130, shortly after
                            their return to Athens. Theodoropoulos also present.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> opened discussion with
                            statement situation very grave. He then ran through events and meetings

                            badly received. After summarizing the very difficult meeting that he had
                            in early morning hours with Caglayangil<note n="3" xml:id="d329fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d328">Document 328</ref>.</note> he handed over
                            the two <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> documents emitting from that
                            session, namely letter to him from Caglayangil limiting Greek withdrawal
                            period to 45 days and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> draft accord
                            representing “final” Turk position.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said honesty compelled him
                            to state time is very short and Turks will not accept any change in
                            draft. This is fact of life.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said this was
                            ultimatum which he instinctively inclined reject. From beginning to end
                            of Vance process he had tried to settle issue. With each exchange,
                            however, Turks had raised the price.</p>
                        <p>5. While he did not seem to boggle over 45-day limit on withdrawal and
                            did not have particular difficulties with operative paras affecting
                            Greece-Turkey relations, para 4 concerning <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> operations appeared impossible to him. Greece, he
                            said, could take steps on its own but it cannot make decisions for
                            Cyprus. Furthermore, he was convinced that chaos would result if Greek
                            forces were withdrawn and the National Guard was disbanded before some
                            other force were constituted. He said he could not recommend this to his
                            government, since it makes no sense. Furthermore it would be impossible
                            to carry the Cabinet with this proposition or to get <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept it.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> then pointed out that
                            para 4 as drafted by Turks was not operative and furthermore language
                            implied parallelism between phasing out National Guard and constituting
                            new force. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> pointed out<pb n="677" xml:id="pg_677" facs="0715"/> that provisions of para would
                            be implemented by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> not by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Therefore, parallelism and timing was
                            in hands of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In addition, he had made
                            perfectly clear to Turks that para as drafted was not operative. Turks
                            have also specifically stated they have no time limits in mind re
                            [garble—para 4].</p>
                        <p>7. This exchange somewhat buoyed <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> who said he would discuss letter and draft
                            accord with Cabinet. At <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s
                            urging he agreed withhold negative decision until he talked to <persName corresp="#p_BM1">Brosio</persName> and to us. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> told him we had some ideas which
                            might help.</p>

                            said Cabinet had accepted <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> proposals
                            and he would present letter to that effect to <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>. Decision was reached after moving scene in

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said he also hoped
                            Turks would not try score propaganda victory as result <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> decision. Said he had prepared lengthy

                            will open the door to direct contacts between two countries.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said he wished express his

                            but could not <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0716"/>commit <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> re para 4. Government was
                            prepared, however, to try bring him aboard. Second concerned
                            relationship in some paras between elimination of National Guard and
                            constituting new force. Government believed these actions should be
                            parallel. Third concerned definition of military personnel in para 3.
                            Vance interrupted at that point to express belief each side should hold
                            own interpretation that issue. Fourth was <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> desire stretch withdrawal period from 45 to 60 days in
                            order provide logistical and elbow room.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> suggested that once
                            withdrawals began issues like this should be practical subjects of
                            discussion with Turks. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>
                            ended discussion by expressing firm conviction that war would have
                            occurred [had not] President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> sent the <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> Mission to search for a peaceful solution. On
                            behalf his government he expressed deep appreciation to President.</p>
                        <p>6. Text of letter from <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> to
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> follows: “I have the
                            honour to inform you that the Greek Government accept the proposals
                            contained in the attached text, on the understanding that the measures

                            1967, shall be implemented in good faith.</p>
                        <p>The Greek Government wish to point out that, as far as the provisions of
                            paragraph 4 are concerned, which they read as also covering the question
                            of the National Guard, they cannot engage the responsibility of the
                            Government of Cyprus, whose rights must remain by necessity

                        <p>76019. Tovan 37. Ref.: <gloss target="#t_Vanto1">Vanto</gloss> 41.<note n="2" xml:id="d331fn2">See <ref target="#d330fn2">footnote 2,
                                    Document 330</ref>.</note> For <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> from Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. Problem all along with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has been that US does not have much of a handle
                            on him. We have no economic or military aid program, and communications
                            facilities, for which we are to pay rent, are distinctly to our
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has never wavered in
                            his conviction that US will not permit Turkey to invade Cyprus. Your
                            present mission is probably seen by him as further convincing evidence
                            of this. In current crisis Russians have complicated matters by telling
                            GOC that Turks are bluffing. You would wish to disabuse him on this—in
                            fact, if you can scare him it might be helpful.</p>
                        <p>3. In circumstances best tactic would appear be to attempt play on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' vanity by
                            stressing his positive role as champion of peace. If this fails, you
                            should try convince <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            that if he tries torpedo Greek-Turkey accord, and Turks invade as
                            result, GOC would be considered as bearing the principal responsibility
                            for failure to avert a catastrophe. In such circumstances world opinion
                            would be turned against GOC, and would regard GOC as having set
                            political objective above peace. In such circumstances, moreover, GOC
                            should not be assuming that US would intervene militarily. GOC will have
                            noted that there has been no change in routine disposition of Sixth
                            Fleet throughout this crisis.</p>
                        <p>4. Above is best strategy I can think of view lack of the
                            instrumentalities of support we possess in other countries. In general
                            you could stress that lack of cooperative action will inevitably have
                            effect on our future relations, without being specific. I would caution
                            you against suggesting any specific US action to help <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> if he behaves, beyond renewed
                            willingness to be helpful in attempt solve general Cyprus problem, in
                            view well-known tendency of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to use such gestures to his own advantage.</p>
                        <p>5. In the event you get indications that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> feels that he can disregard the Greek-Turk
                            agreement by going to the Security Council on the assumption he could
                            get a better deal, you should tell him bluntly that we would use every
                            possible means at our disposal to prevent this <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0718"/>and to ensure that any action there
                            would not go beyond the substance of the Greek-Turk agreement.</p>
                        <p>6. We would prefer that you use the above only if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> refers to this possibility;
                            otherwise, we see no particular advantage in your taking the initiative
                            in this regard.</p>
                        <p>7. The following points may be useful to you, subject to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName>'s views. (He is real
                            expert on <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>(a) I understand that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            reacts badly to strong words and a forceful approach.</p>
                        <p>(b) It should be made very clear to him that <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has made a difficult decision and requires his
                            support.</p>
                        <p>(c) <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> does value his
                            relations with the US, and could be encouraged anticipate more active
                            effort on our part to tackle general Cyprus problem once this crisis
                            over.</p>
                        <p>8. Congratulations on a superb job so far, and good luck!</p>

                        <p>The President opened the meeting by requesting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> to give a summary of the current
                            situation in Cyprus.</p>
                        <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0719"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Cyrus Vance</persName>, the President's special
                            emissary, has done a superb job and has warded off war between Turkey
                            and Greece. He did not want to embarrass Luke Battle but said that he
                            was delighted to have had him as Assistant Secretary working on this
                            problem on an hourly basis. He asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> to outline where we now are in our effort to end
                            the Crisis over Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>: Is
                            optimistic that war between Greece and Turkey would be avoided. To Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> belongs the credit for
                            the astonishing progress which has been made in keeping the
                            Turkish-Greek crisis over Cyprus from turning into hostilities.
                            Provisions of a statement which both Greece and Turkey have accepted
                            (copy attached)<note n="2" xml:id="d332fn2">Not found.</note> were
                            summarized. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> is now in
                            Cyprus trying to persuade Cyprus President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept this agreement. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could cause trouble in many
                            ways, but the expectation is that he will not block the Vance
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>The problem of Cyprus will be with us for some time to come, difficulties
                            will rise in the future, for example, reaching an agreement to expand
                            the role of the United Nations, but for the moment a Greek-Turkish war
                            has been avoided.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName>: Turkey wants the
                            United Nations Security Council to approve a new and expanded UN mandate
                            covering Cyprus. We do not think Council action is necessary but the
                            problem is in the hands of the Secretary General and the heat is off us.
                            The Turks can more easily live with the failure of the Secretary General
                            to obtain a new mandate from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Security Council than they could if we had agreed to get a new mandate
                            and had been unsuccessful.</p>
                        <p>Everyone is appreciative that the President made <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> available for this assignment,
                            adding that without his activity, Turkey would now be at war with
                            Greece.</p>
                        <p>The President: Asked General <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wheeler</persName> to summarize the military situation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_WGE1">Wheeler</persName>: Tension between
                            the two countries has somewhat abated, pending the outcome of the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> negotiations.</p>
                        <p>1. Turkey had an advantage over Greece in the air and on land. The Greeks
                            have an advantage at sea because of their greater naval strength.</p>
                        <p>2. If Greeks [<hi rend="italic">Turks</hi>?] chose to invade Greek
                            Thrace, they could advance rapidly, probably as far as Salonika.</p>
                        <p>3. The Turks could put several divisions in Cyprus, probably on the north
                            side in the Kyrenia area, in two to three weeks. They could gain control
                            of the island, only some 40 miles from Turkey, despite Greek
                            opposition.</p>

                        <p>4. If the Turks attack, it would take them 24 hours to gain air
                            superiority by pre-emptive air strikes on Greek bases. They would
                            probably invade Cyprus but probably would not invade Greece from
                            Thrace.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> again reviewed the
                            events of the past week, stating that his mission is to prevent a war
                            and not to solve all the complex issues of Cyprus. War has been very
                            close this week. Had he not reached Ankara on November 23, the Turks
                            would have gone to war. In the course of intensive discussions with the
                            GOT, President Sunay had assured him that Turkey would not invade
                            Cyprus. However, time ran out last night and, if Greece had not accepted
                            the proposals, the Turkish units would have been on shores of Cyprus
                            this morning. Intelligence estimates indicate they could put close to
                            50,000 men ashore with heavy equipment in 48-hours under cover of
                            complete air control. Carnage would result.</p>
                        <p>In response, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> expressed
                            his deep gratitude for the U.S. effort to preserve the peace. He fully
                            understood the critical nature of recent days and was happy that war had
                            not occurred. He had slept while Vance worked in Ankara, confident that
                            nothing would happen.</p>
                        <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0721"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said he understood the
                            Greek Government had accepted the agreement document but he had not
                            heard directly from Athens as yet. While <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> could properly make its own decisions, he had, of
                            course, difficulties with the document, particularly para. 4.</p>
                        <p>Cyprus, he said, is plagued by the presence of foreign troops. His basic
                            objective is the total demilitarization of the island, including the
                            Greek and Turk contingents. Under those circumstances he would also
                            disband the National Guard which was costing too much money. With help
                            of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>, he would try to disarm
                            everyone. Only police force would remain and his government would have
                            talks with Turkish community about this.</p>
                        <p>In view of need for total demilitarization it would be difficult for him
                            to agree that Greek and Turk contingents could remain on the island.
                            They were source of infection and should be rooted out now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said he realized the
                            Archbishop's view this subject and had insisted that language relating
                            to the withdrawal of Greek and Turk forces be qualified “as a first step
                            along the lines of the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s previous
                            appeal.” Since the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s appeal called
                            for ultimate demilitarization, acceptance of the document in no way
                            impeded movement toward final goal of elimination of all military
                            forces. Therefore, removal of contingents was in no way precluded by
                            language of document. However, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will
                            not agree discuss this issue at this time. Approval of document as it
                            stands is vital step in avoidance bloody war.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> then shifted to dangers
                            of foreign intervention, saying he hoped guarantee could be obtained
                            from U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> on behalf of Security
                            Council. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> responded, saying
                            he had no authority to give <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> security
                            commitments. He suggested <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> look to Security Council in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Turning to para. 4, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> already had adequate
                            mandate and call for enlarged and improved mandate unnecessary.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> agreed and emphasized
                            that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had insisted on this language
                            over his strong objections. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> then said that the para could not be accepted
                            unless a reference were made to elimination two contingents. Vance
                            responded that <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would not agree and
                            that war would be certain outcome of GOC unwillingness accept agreement.
                            Progress on broader issues possible if war is avoided.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> then gave <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> message from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>. Although Archbishop
                            read carefully and made wry comment about reference to his wisdom, he
                            did not respond substantively.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> then suggested <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could write letter to him,
                            stating GOC approved proposal but reserved views re removal of
                            contingents and ultimate demilitarization. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> said he would draft a letter clearly indicating
                            his views these matters. Vance pointed out that message <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0722"/>would have to be restrained in tone or
                            it would be read as rejection by <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>.
                            This might trigger invasion with dire consequences.</p>
                        <p>Session ended with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            statement that he would take proposals to Cabinet and would meet with
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> later in day.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> stubbornly and cleverly
                            defended a defective GOC written commentary into the early morning
                            hours.</p>
                        <p>Finally, His Beatitude gave way sufficiently to permit the completion of
                            a draft which seems sufficiently forthcoming to contribute to the
                            overall defusing effort. Negotiating with him under circumstances
                            threatening existence of his country can be fairly described as unique
                            experience.</p>
                        <p>Text of the secret written GOC comment signed by Spyros Kyprianou,
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs, follows:</p>
                        <p>“Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>We welcome the many and strenuous efforts which have been made in recent
                            days to preserve peace in this area.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the Republic of Cyprus, referring to the proposals
                            contained in the attached text, wishes to state its position as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>1. The first three paragraphs of the said proposals concern primarily the
                            Governments of Greece and Turkey and have already been agreed <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0723"/>upon by them. The Government of
                            Cyprus acknowledging the aforesaid agreement between the Governments of
                            Greece and Turkey considers it as a first step on the lines of the
                            Secretary-General's appeal of November 24, 1967, for the phased
                            withdrawal of all forces and complete demilitarisation.<note n="2" xml:id="d334fn2">U.N. Doc. S/8248/Add.5; for text, see <hi rend="italic">American Foreign Policy: Current Documents,
                                    1967,</hi> pp. 367–368. This was Secretary-General <persName corresp="#p_TU1">Thant</persName>'s second appeal; his first was
                                on November 22 (see <ref target="#d307">Document 307</ref>).</note>
                            It, therefore, maintains that such phased withdrawal should include the
                            Greek and Turkish contingents because it firmly believes that, in this
                            way, the cause of peace would be best served.</p>
                        <p>2. The pacification measures stated in paragraph 4 are objectives of the
                            Cyprus Government.</p>
                        <p>3. The Cyprus Government questions the need for ‘an enlarged and improved
                            mandate for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>.’ It suggests
                            that the three governments discuss this issue with the Secretary-General
                            of the United Nations in New York.</p>

                            mandate prove unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>C. Turkey's <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies and especially
                            US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Canada should declare
                            immediately after appeal issued by SYG that they support appeal as a
                            whole but giving particular support to para 4.</p>
                        <p>D. At Security Council meeting on Dec 15 concerned with prolongation of
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> consensus of members
                            should be sought by Turkey's allies to obtain approval of new role for
                                <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> envisaged para 4 <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s appeal. (This most important to box
                            in <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>E. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> insists that withdrawal of Greek
                            forces start in shortest possible time and be carried out in continuous
                            and uninterrupted fashion and in good faith. (<gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> explained this is essential to avoid complications
                            and to establish a basis for an improvement in Greek-Turkish
                            relations.)</p>
                        <p>F. Repetition of incidents such as those of Nov 15–16 on Cyprus must be
                            avoided at all costs. Absolute security must be maintained on
                            island.</p>
                        <p>G. Greek Cypriots must avoid provocative acts. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> has given like instructions to Turkish Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>H. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> must be prevented
                            from playing role in New York in connection with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s appeal that would sabotage Turkish-Greek agreement.
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies, especially
                            representatives of US, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Canada, who
                            took part in working out “five points”, should play efficacious role to
                            this end in Nicosia. Interval during which <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s appeal issued and replies given is especially
                            critical. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should not
                            say appeal is unacceptable to GOC, should not be allowed to interpret it
                            so as to sabotage it.</p>
                        <p>2. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> then said that under above
                            conditions, and once agreement with <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            on new formula for para 4 seemed assured, he saw no need for <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> to hurry to New York. On the
                            contrary, he could usefully remain in Athens and endeavor to plan with
                            Greeks accelerated withdrawal of Greek troops in manner indicated above.
                            (Implication was GOT would do its part on standdown.)</p>
                        <p>3. Caglayangil said that as soon as <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            makes his appeal <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> would like to have
                            clear affirmative answer from <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            without qualifications or interpretations. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> could say GOC accepts appeal of<pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0726"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> reserving always its own viewpoint
                            regarding final solution. He should say nothing more. If style and
                            content <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s appeal conforms to
                            agreement <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will immediately respond
                            that it accepts and is ready to conform to it. <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> will point especially to para 4 saying that it approves
                            and supports this provision.</p>
                        <p>4. I said would immediately report <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>'s remarks.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> had suggested this
                            course of action prior to our receipt of <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 2673. When I received word by phone by Embassy along
                            lines <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 2673, I explained <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Goldberg</persName> apparently now thinking along these lines too.
                            I warned him however that we had no indication as yet that Turks would
                            be willing go along with this suggestion. I reminded him that originally
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had informed <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> that document stood or fell as a
                            unit. Whether they could be persuaded to follow this suggestion was
                            matter we could not answer at this time. We would try get their
                            concurrence.</p>
                        <p>3. I showed <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> new text para
                            four per last para <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 2672. He
                            commented that if GOC accepted the revised language, would mean that GOC
                            would agree that what the Turks want can be accomplished under the
                            present mandate. He said in presence of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> GOC would reject language of para four unless
                            qualified as per letter to <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>.</p>

                            General's appeal as it was his understanding that para four would be

                            Cypriot side. As in Ankara, the Cabinet was in session in an adjoining

                            to be in negative mood. Ministerial opinion showed signs of stiffening
                            against Turkish pressures, probably reflecting irritation at Turkish
                            overflights of Nicosia and a growing belief that the US would hold the
                            Turks in check.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> opened the discussion by
                            endeavoring to impress the Archbishop with the sincerity of the US peace
                            effort, the seriousness of the Turkish threat, and the necessity for
                            Cyprus to pay for the events of November 14–15. This set the stage for
                            the presentation to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> of
                            the revised draft of para 4 and a draft letter of confirmation. Text

                        <p>If this language were approved by the Governments of Greece and Turkey,

                            The Security Council further requested all concerned urgently to assist

                        <p>'In the light of the Security Council consensus and the continuing
                            tension in the area, as Secretary General of the United Nations, I now
                            urge the Governments of Greece and Turkey to take immediate steps to
                            remove any threat to the security of each other and of Cyprus, and as a
                            first step along the lines of my previous appeal to bring about an
                            expeditious withdrawal of those forces in excess of the Turkish and
                            Greek contingents. In addition <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> under its existing mandate would be available to
                            undertake an enhanced and broader pacification role, which would include
                            supervision of disarmament of all forces constituted after 1963 and new
                            practical arrangements for the safeguarding of internal security
                            including the safety of all citizens. The Secretary General's good
                            offices would be available to work out the specifics with the interested
                            parties.'</p>
                        <p>The Government of Cyprus would accept such appeal.”</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said the revised para 4
                            had been approved by the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, and <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>. Furthermore, it satisfactorily met the GOC belief that
                            it would be unnecessary to request a new and broader mandate for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> and also would clarify for the
                            GOC the extent of an enhanced and broader role for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> since it called for discussions
                            with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> of the specifics of the new
                            effort.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> replied in his
                            customary loving style. He was grateful for US assistance but could not
                            accept ultimatum. If a “yes or no” answer was required, the answer was
                            “no”. The revised draft was somewhat worse than the earlier draft with
                            which he had had serious difficulties. If asked what the GOC response
                            was to para 4, it was clear “unacceptable.” Furthermore, he could not
                            understand why the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> did not issue an
                            appeal limited to the first three paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>5. After this opening salvo, it was clear that the mission's expectations
                            of a long and difficult evening had been fully justified. Having made
                            his mark, the Archbishop was relatively quiet thereafter.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> was center stage
                            through most of the remaining period, worrying the draft and the problem
                            like a terrier gnawing a bone. Occasionally, <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> joined the game.</p>
                        <p>7. Fundamentally, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> tried to
                            explain to them that his mission was to prevent a war, not to solve the
                            overall problems of Cyprus. It was understandable that the Cyprus
                            Government resented discussions conducted <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0731"/>under the pressure of a gun. But the revised agreement,
                            if approved, could put an end to the guns, and could set the stage for
                            subsequent discussions of the basic issues of the island.</p>
                        <p>8. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> drafted a
                            bare-boned para 4 which he asked us to try out with the Greek and Turk
                            Perm Reps in New York (see reftel).</p>
                        <p>9. It was agreed the group would reconvene at 08:30 for further
                            discussions. Clearly it was going to be very difficult to obtain
                            agreement of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to a para
                            4 which makes sense.<note n="4" xml:id="d339fn4">In Vanto 76, December
                                2, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> reported that if
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> remained
                                adamant, he intended to tell him he would be returning immediately
                                to Athens for passage to the United States, effectively ending the
                                mediation effort. (Ibid.) In a December 2 memorandum to the
                                President, 10:45 a.m., Bromley Smith explained that while <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> remained in Athens to prevent
                                an outbreak of war, U Thant would issue a short appeal that would
                                serve as the basis for an immediate token withdrawal of Greek forces
                                from Cyprus. The United States hoped this approach could avoid
                                recourse to force. (Johnson Library, National Security File, Memos

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, accompanied by Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BT1">Belcher</persName> and John Walsh, had a
                            two-hour meeting beginning 1300 with Archbishop <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, President of Parliament
                                <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>, and <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> was adamant, rejecting para 4
                            as revised during the night, and refusing any further efforts at
                            compromise. He said Greece and Turkey can do what they want but it was
                            impossible for him to accept anything that resembled commitment prior to
                            discussion in Security Council. He said during course of our meeting
                            Greek Government had urged him not to <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0732"/>reject the draft para 4 but he had refused. In final
                            statement, he expressed great appreciation to President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for
                            untiring effort to safeguard the peace. You have done the utmost, he
                            said, and we will always be grateful no matter what the future may
                            bring. When <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> pressed him to
                            ponder again and to withhold a final decision, he responded negatively.
                            He did, however, agree to refrain from press comment, although GOC had
                            already begun to circulate background statement that it would never
                            knuckle under Turk pressure. Thus there was no give in the rigid GOC
                            position as time ran out in Nicosia for the Vance Mission. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> will leave approximately 1800 for
                            Athens.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> opened the discussion by
                            reading the following prepared statement:</p>
                        <p>“We have been working throughout the night and this morning in a
                            desperate attempt to get acceptance of the proposal which we transmitted
                            on your behalf yesterday to the Government of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In the early morning hours the Government of Turkey flatly rejected your
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Through the rest of the night our Ambassadors in Ankara and New York with
                            almost superhuman effort endeavored to get the Turks to change their
                            position. They have been successful in getting the Turks to agree to the
                            fundamental issues contained in your proposal, namely, that the matter
                            should be considered by the Security Council and that the Secretary
                            General's good offices would be available to work out the specifics with
                            the interested parties. In doing this the United States has made great
                            sacrifices. In June 1964 the United States at great political cost sent
                            a letter from our President to the Government of Turkey in order to
                            preserve the peace at that time. Last night in obtaining the concessions
                            that I have referred to from the Turks, the United States again expended
                            an important element of its influence and prestige.</p>
                        <p>The situation as we see it is as follows:</p>
                        <p>A. The Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey have publicly announced
                            that Greece and Turkey have reached an agreement.<note n="2" xml:id="d340fn2">Greece and Turkey each stated on December 2 that
                                they had reached an agreement on a settlement to the Cyprus crisis;
                                see <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>, December 3,
                                1967.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>B. Therefore, insofar as the world is concerned an agreement for peace
                            has been reached subject only to the possibility that it may be
                            frustrated by the unwillingness of the Government of Cyprus to permit
                            that agreement to be implemented. This all hangs on paragraph 4.</p>
                        <p>C. With respect to paragraph 4, the Government of Turkey has said that it
                            will return to the original language of paragraph 4 as contained in the
                            document attached to your letter to me, and will also agree to the
                            addition of the last sentence with respect to the good offices of the
                            Secretary General.</p>
                        <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0733"/>
                        <p>D. Thus we are faced with a situation where the decision for war or peace
                            hangs on the difference between the words ‘should be’ and ‘will discuss
                            in the Security Council’. </p>
                        <p>You and your government are thus faced with the opportunity to go down in
                            history as the man and the government which made the decision which
                            preserved the peace in this area, or the decision which plunged it into
                            war.”</p>
                        <p>3. At the end of this statement, Vance handed to the Archbishop the
                            following revised text of para 4 negotiated during the late night hours
                            in Ankara:</p>
                        <p>“In response to the appeal of the Secretary General there should be an
                            enlarged and improved mandate for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> giving it an increased pacification role, which
                            would include supervision of disarmament of all forces constituted after
                            1963 and new practical arrangements for the safeguarding of internal
                            security including the safety of all citizens. The Secretary General's
                            good offices would be available to work out the specifics with the
                            interested parties.”</p>
                        <p>4. He pointed out that last night the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>
                            had flatly refused to accept the text of para 4 proposed by the GOC.
                            Under our heavy and politically costly pressure, the <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> had agreed to revised para 4, cited
                            above, which would meet GOC desires to debate issue in Security Council
                            and to act under good offices of <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>.
                            Turks had accepted this despite their fears that GOC would have enormous
                            advantage in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. We firmly believe this
                            would protect GOC interests and would lift the terrible threat of war
                            from the region.</p>
                        <p>5. This statement ran into a stonewall of Cypriot opposition. The
                            Archbishop said he could not accept it because it would only create
                            misunderstandings in the future. Greece and Turkey could do whatever
                            they wished but he would not agree to do more than discuss the issues
                            encompassed in para 4.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> stated the Turks
                            wished the GOC to accept certain principles and then to discuss them.
                            Why, he asked, should the GOC make concessions. Furthermore, if the GOC
                            agreed to the formulation as presented it would limit its freedom in the
                            Security Council. This was a matter of substance and not merely
                            protocol.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> then restated the familiar
                            line of argumentation for GOC acceptance: The agreement between Greece
                            and Turkey was a three-legged stool which would fall without GOC
                            cooperation; the differences between the GOC and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> drafts were largely semantical in nature; the position
                            of the GOC in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would be fully
                            protected and the GOC would have an enormous advantage in any SC debates
                            on this issue; and finally, the world would never understand if this
                            opportunity to prevent war were not seized.</p>
                        <pb n="696" xml:id="pg_696" facs="0734"/>
                        <p>8. This was not persuasive to the Cypriots. When <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>, who had played a helpful role
                            throughout the discussions, said that the world should not be surprised
                            if the GOC does not agree, we decided to take a walk in the rose garden
                            in search of inspiration and to buy time for Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Goldberg</persName>'s efforts in New York. As we
                            stepped into the garden, the Archbishop sweetly advised us not to work
                            very hard since he had already made up his mind.</p>
                        <p>9. After 45 minutes, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> resumed
                            his advocacy of peace, re- working the argumentation and hammering at
                            the point that the GOC was refusing the safe path to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and away from war simply over a matter of
                            words which were of little consequence.</p>
                        <p>10. He went on to say that the Turks and the Cypriots were locked into
                            rigid positions over words, and, tragically, they were going to go to
                            war. He emphasized that, while not defending or condoning Turkish war
                            hysteria, the GOC had to recognize that the present situation developed
                            from the tragic incidents of November 14–15. A price must be paid by the
                            GOC for those events. He beseeched the Archbishop to show the
                            flexibility now required to prevent the misery of war and the loss of
                            countless innocent lives.</p>
                        <p>11. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> then said the GOC
                            could not accept. Their only recourse now was to go promptly to the
                            Security Council to show the world who the aggressor was.</p>
                        <p>12. At that point, there was little more to say. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> expressed great personal sadness
                            about the evident failure of the search for peace in which so many
                            people have engaged. President <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName> and he had been convinced that a just settlement
                            was imminent and now it appeared that no one in the world would
                            understand or appreciate.</p>
                        <p>13. He then asked with great solemnity that the Archbishop not give him a
                            final negative answer but rather to ponder once again. Our plane would
                            depart for Athens in a few hours and <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> could be reached there.</p>
                        <p>14. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> then said he had no
                            need to ponder. He had made up his mind. Vance's words had raised a
                            delicate issue for him, since he was deeply grateful to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_JLB1">Johnson</persName>, to <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, and to the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> who had done their utmost to preserve
                            the peace.</p>
                        <p>Whatever the outcome of the present situation he would never forget what
                            the United States has done. He then concluded with the words: “I know my
                            answer”.</p>

                        <p>15. In departing the Palace, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>,
                            by agreement, limited his comments to the assertion that he was
                            returning to Athens.<note n="3" xml:id="d340fn3">In <gloss target="#t_Vanto1">Vanto</gloss> 85, December 3, <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> requested that the

                            approval forced <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' hand
                            tactically. Archbishop was required to respond in apparently positive
                            manner since he could not very well reject <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> initiative for peace once such initiative was taken.
                            However, tone of GOC letter to <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> is
                            guardedly affirmative at best and clearly reserves GOC positions on
                            fundamental problems that plagued <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> discussions.<note n="3" xml:id="d341fn3">On

                        <p>2. Letter highlights GOC positions which will be basis for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> battle that is shaping up, viz:</p>
                        <p>A. GOC goal is “ultimate and complete withdrawal from Republic of Cyprus
                            of all non-Cypriot armed forces” (other than <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>). This includes both Greek and Turk contingents and
                            doubtless GOC will seek tie disarming and disbanding of National Guard
                            to withdrawal of contingents.</p>
                        <pb n="698" xml:id="pg_698" facs="0736"/>
                        <p>B. GOC will demand “effective guarantees against military intervention in
                            affairs of Cyprus” probably from <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> will not miss
                            opportunity to seize upon <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> discussions
                            of Cyprus problem to bring into question Turkish treaty right of
                            intervention in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>C. Expanded role for <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> must be
                            considered in terms of GOC “sovereignty, territorial integrity and
                            independence.” This raises question of who is going to be policeman on
                            Cyprus: GOC with sovereignty over whole island or expanded <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> to which some of GOC
                            sovereignty would be given in trust at least temporarily.</p>
                        <p>D. Pacification and permanent peaceful solution are to be “within
                            framework of Charter and relevant resolutions on Cyprus by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and GA” (an obvious reference to GA
                            resolution of December 1965 inter alia).<note n="4" xml:id="d341fn4">General Assembly Resolution 2077 (XX).</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In above points we can see emerging general lines of GOC strategy.
                            Building case on sovereignty of government, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter and favorable <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            statements on Cyprus (March '64 SC Resolution, December '65 GA
                            Resolution, Galo-Plaza Report), <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> through his forensic Foreign Minister,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>, will attempt to
                            achieve complete demilitarization of Cyprus, effective guarantee for
                            inviolability of the Republic, and extension of sovereignty of his
                            government to all parts of island including Turkish enclaves where his
                            writ does not now run.</p>
                        <p>4. Intensity of Turk and Turk Cypriot reaction to such GOC strategy in
                                <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> can easily be imagined. Basing
                            legal position on London/Zurich Turks will wage bitter fight for what
                            they regard as basic elements permitting peaceful existence of Turk
                            Cypriots on Cyprus. We have already had full plate of suspicions from
                            Kuchukery, even before they had read letter of “acceptance.” Our next
                            meeting, after they have digested in full the GOC reply, should be even
                            more revealing of Turk and Turk Cypriot fears.<note n="5" xml:id="d341fn5">The Cypriot Government, in a December 4 note,

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> then reviewed his report
                            to the President, stressing the need that the report not be made public
                            or any acknowledgement that a written report was submitted. (A single
                            copy of this report is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d342fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> It is not for redistribution.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> said the most
                            important impression that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> brought back from his trip was that both Greece
                            and Turkey were anxious to reduce their commitment to Cyprus. The
                            Secretary said Greece could do this only under a dictatorship so we
                            should try to get this disengagement from Cyprus before a democratically
                            elected government comes into office in Greece. Otherwise, the Secretary
                            said public opinion would not permit a democratically elected government
                            to reduce its commitment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> said he appreciated the
                            fact the President gave the widest latitude possible in handling this
                                situation.<note n="3" xml:id="d342fn3">For text of President

                        <p>Dear Dan:</p>
                        <p>With the Cyprus issue having survived the war threat, the domestic Greek
                            political pot is boiling once again.</p>
                        <p>Twice in recent days King Constantine has expressed to me his anxiety
                            about the Junta's intentions. On November 30, when he and the Queen came
                            to the Embassy residence for dinner with my wife and me and <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Cy Vance</persName> and John Walsh, he told me in
                            an aside that he feared the Junta might move that night to arrest
                            Defense Minister Spandidakis and Generals <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> and Perides. The King had met each of the three
                            earlier in the day and had been concerned that the Generals expected to
                            spend the night in Athens. He had advised General Spandidakis not to
                            sleep at home and the other two to find places other than their usual
                            quarters in Athens.</p>
                        <p>The difficulty as the King understood it was that Generals <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> and Perides had been furious at
                            the government for agreeing to pull back the Greek troops (in excess of
                            the contingent) from Cyprus and that Spandidakis as a hawk had also
                            resisted the government's decisions. The Junta ministers, as leaders of
                            the government, had accused all three generals of insubordination and
                            talked of dismissing them. Should they try to arrest them that night
                            there would be a first-class crisis. From other sources we had
                            understood that at the same time the Junta leadership was bracing its
                            security mechanism out of fear that the King might be organizing a
                            countercoup. I put our political and [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] people on an all-night alert
                            to watch the situation, which was complicated later in the evening when
                            a homemade bomb was thrown into a crowd in downtown Athens and a woman
                            killed. She was the first casualty of the anti-regime terrorist campaign
                            mounted sporadically in recent months, apparently by very small groups
                            of provocateurs.</p>
                        <p>At about 3:30 a.m. we thought the King's foreboding might have substance.
                            The Royal Gendarmerie Commander for Attica put out a hurried <pb n="701" xml:id="pg_701" facs="0739"/>call for numbers of his best men, who
                            on arrival at gendarmerie headquarters were armed with tommy guns and
                            hand grenades and dispatched in squads of five or six to various
                            sections of the city with the mission of protecting various ministers in
                            their homes. It was only with the arrival of daylight that we were
                            certain that “protect” did not mean “arrest.” Later information
                            suggested that the Junta was in fact worried that the evening's bomb
                            incident might be followed by more bombing attempts directed at the
                            homes of certain ministers. It was in this general atmosphere that the
                            King that evening muttered to me that “I'm going to have to get rid of
                            these people (the Junta) one day soon.” He was not more specific,
                            however. (He made this comment while attempting to reach Junta ministers
                            by telephone to get the details of the downtown bombing incident. The
                            last time he had used my telephone to call ministers was on the night
                            when I told him that a court martial had given a five-year sentence to
                                Averoff.)<note n="2" xml:id="d343fn2">Averoff was arrested on July
                                12, charged with violation of a rule against gatherings of five or
                                more persons. He was tried and sentenced to 5 years in prison on
                                August 15 and pardoned on August 16.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>As you perceive, the dicey part of all this is that those generals whose
                            military pride was most hurt by the decision to withdraw Greek forces
                            from Cyprus under Turkish pressure are precisely the ones on whom the
                            King has been most counting for support against the Junta in any future
                            showdown. An oddity of recent days, in fact, is that on Cyprus questions
                            the King, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> and Col.
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> have supported the same policy
                            lines while opponents of the Junta and natural supporters of the King's
                            role in Greece have opposed Greek “capitulation.”</p>
                        <p>On December 5, when I called on the King to recapitulate developments
                            during the final days of the <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>
                                Mission,<note n="3" xml:id="d343fn3">A memorandum of conversation is
                                in Department of State, Central Files, POL 15–1.</note> we had some
                            further conversation about the domestic situation. He was preoccupied
                            with difficulties he foresaw on the immediate horizon. He senses that
                            with the easing of the Cyprus crisis the Junta will attempt to move very
                            rapidly to recoup its diminishing prestige and consolidate its hold on
                            power. Specifically, he anticipates that the Junta will promptly press
                            for the appointment of Col. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> as Deputy
                            Prime Minister and will also try to get rid of Spandidakis and those
                            senior generals (the King's supporters) who had opposed the government's
                            decisions on the Cyprus question.</p>
                        <p>The King also asked whether I had seen the Caramanlis statement.<note n="4" xml:id="d343fn4">In a November 29 interview in Le Monde,
                                    <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName> had
                                strongly criticized the foreign and domestic policies of the
                                Junta.</note> I had, and I commented that we had been approached by
                            a friend of Caramanlis who had recently seen him in Paris (but I did not
                            identify the source as Athanasios Tsaldaris) to urge that we encourage
                            the King and <pb n="702" xml:id="pg_702" facs="0740"/>Caramanlis to get
                            into communication, since they were the only two men who, working
                            together, could resolve the situation. The King rather abruptly changed
                            the line of the conversation without commenting on this point. Nor did
                            he echo my praise of the performance in recent days of Pipinelis; on the
                            contrary, he observed that Pipinelis had made some mistakes in dealing
                            with the Greek governmental and military elements which were saved only
                            by the King's intervention.</p>
                        <p>It was obvious the King did not wish to discuss political personalities
                            who might be available as alternatives to the Junta, and on this
                            occasion I did not press him. I can only conclude that either the
                            family's antipathy to Caramanlis remains strong or they are in a
                            deep-covered relationship that he did not want to discuss with me.
                            Unfortunately, the former is the more likely possibility.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile we have been hearing from all of our political contacts that
                            now is the time for the King to move against the Junta and that he would
                            be certain to have the support of practically all of the old crowd, from
                            George Papandreou to Harry Rendis. Some of the reports indicated they
                            would support a move by the King to create a government of military
                            figures responsive to him or even on the basis of another year or so of
                            martial law or a variant thereof. We have also heard from these sources
                            that the Junta is losing credibility in the country. Certainly it has
                            blundered in foreign relations and now in relations with press
                            proprietors, and these missteps have not gone unnoticed. It may be that
                            skepticism of the Junta's effectiveness will spread through wider
                            segments of Greek society and even that that most potent non-military
                            weapon of all, ridicule, might come into play. This could undermine the
                            Junta's public support but not, at least for sometime, its command of
                            the military units that control the Athens area and its grip on
                            strategic units in the northern commands.</p>
                        <p>As of today, we don't know what impact the new constitutional draft will
                            have, nor even its thrust. Since the beginning of the Cyprus crisis I
                            have not heard anything (nor have I pushed to seek it) about the draft
                            now presumably approaching completion and the government's plans for
                            dealing with it. However, it could become a factor in the new situation,
                            just as could the open campaign of opposition to the Junta that seems to
                            have been launched by Caramanlis.<note n="5" xml:id="d343fn5">Printed

                            resignation of government so he can reform it to carry forward “Greek
                            renaissance.”</p>
                        <p>2. King asked that we pass his instructions through our channels to
                            Ministers <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> and
                            Spandidakis ordering them to support his move with NATO allies and then
                            proceed immediately to Thessaloniki to join government.</p>
                        <p>3. King said he would be grateful if President and <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could endorse his move as step toward
                            constitutional government.</p>
                        <p>He also asked that we use all available persuasion to convince colonels
                            it would be unwise for them to seek to oppose his action and thus thrust
                            Greece into civil war. He asked that <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>
                            do what it can to keep Greece's neighbors from taking advantage of
                            situation. He asked if American stations in Greece could broadcast
                            statement he has taped stating he has gone to Macedonia in order to
                            exercise freely his initiative for reforming of government in order to
                            bring about return to democratic normality. He hoped we could do this if
                            forces loyal to him fail in effort projected for this hour to seize
                            Athens radio facilities. Finally, he also asked me to request our
                            Ambassadors to advise King and Queen of Denmark and Princess Sophia in
                                Madrid.<note n="3" xml:id="d344fn3">The message was transmitted to

                            and stating he (King) would address message to Greek people.
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> claimed King had left Tatoi
                            airport one and half hours ago, but he did not know King's present
                            whereabouts. He presumed King had gone to north. According to
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> it is clear King is attempting to
                            overthrow revolution. He asked me specifically whether I had any
                            knowledge of this action “from any direction.” I said there was
                            certainly nothing I could tell him and that if he was implying question

                        <p>2751. 1. Suggest I be given standby instructions, to be executed at what
                            seems appropriate moment, to attempt to make contact with King and with
                            Junta leaders to express <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>'s strong
                            hope questions of government in Greece can be resolved without
                            bloodshed. I would like to say US as ally and friend of Greece not
                            intervening in domestic issue but, as recent Cyprus crisis demonstrated
                            anew, warfare in this part of world can redound to benefit only of
                            Communists. We do not know what plans either King or Junta may have, but
                            we should exceedingly deplore any conflict between elements of Greek
                            armed forces that have been assiduously built up in the past two decades
                            with our substantial assistance. However difficult it may be for
                            contending groups to settle their differences peacefully, we urgently
                            request both sides to find ways to solve present crisis by
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>2. Although it will presumably not be practicable to get this message to
                            King in immediate future, there could be utility in conveying it to
                            Junta leaders. As I see our interests, first object is to get quick
                            resolution with minimum of bloodshed. Whatever we may think of King's
                            wisdom in making this move today, our interests now lie on side of his
                            success since his failure would probably not only destroy monarchy but
                            fasten extreme military Junta on Greece for years to come.</p>
                        <p>3. If and when we satisfied that King has gained full loyalty of northern
                            army, so that preponderance of Greek armed forces committed <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0744"/>to his side, I would wish to add to
                            above message strong appeal to <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> to make
                            deal with King rather than attempting to fight it out. By then he would
                            know military odds against his success. He would know we have strong
                            interest in seeing all elements in Greece accept peacefully government
                            constituted by King. I could say we understand King's broadcast offered
                            Junta forgiveness if they capitulated immediately, and promise that we
                            would strongly urge King to honor this offer even at this late hour if
                            Junta agreed. Alternative, I would point out, could be nothing but
                            disastrous destruction of fabric of Greek society.</p>
                        <p>4. There could be moment in immediate future when passive presence of
                            Sixth Fleet units in Greek waters could have powerful psychological
                            impact here (notably on <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>). I will
                            withhold recommendations until we see how situation clarified.<note n="2" xml:id="d346fn2">In telegram 84028 to Athens, December 13, the

                            facto recognition of this regime which I assume we must consider to be a
                            rebel regime. We are attempting to get some Embassy [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] officer to
                            Kavala tomorrow to establish contact with King, whose movements and
                            plans continue to be unknown to us. Question arises, however, whether
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> should now make its choice and
                            cast die in favor of King. This might involve USG declaration of support
                            of King and instructions to me to join King and his Cabinet wherever
                            they may be at earliest opportunity. You will understand gravity of this
                            decision, involving as it does our total presence and all facilities in
                            all of Greece. My own view at this moment is that in best of
                            circumstances <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> will find it extremely
                            difficult to deal with <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> controlled govt
                            of southern Greece. I cannot say for certain how best civil war can be
                            averted.</p>
                        <p>My sense, however, is that rather than attempting straddle issue we might
                            do best by opting strongly on side of King as soon as we have any
                            information that he has in fact won loyalty and support of preponderance
                            of Greek armed forces. As of this moment, we have no assets to learn
                            true situation in north of Greece, nor has King yet established contact
                            with Greek people or with US. Request your comments.</p>

                        <p>King Constantine of Greece has departed Athens and arrived at Larissa in
                            northern Greece. He has issued an appeal to the people of Greece asking
                            for their support for the restoration of democracy.</p>
                        <p>Since the change of government in Athens on April 21 the United States
                            Government has urged that steps be taken in Greece to bring about a
                            return to constitutionalism. The United States Government has believed,
                            and continues to believe, that it is essential that this be accomplished
                            by peaceful means. We urge the people of Greece to work together for the
                            re-establishment of democracy, avoiding bloodshed and civil strife.</p>

                            You will see that King has been reported by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> source as seen in Kavala this evening. Rather than
                            “arrived at Larissa” I would suggest “arrived at Macedonia.”</p>

                            agree, and laying on line our probable position if they persist in
                            partition. We could opt for King early tomorrow when we know better what

                        <p>However, we prefer to finesse for time being question of state of regime
                            in Athens and group with King. We are inclined prefer standing on
                            position we have taken since April 21 which implies support of King but

                        <p>Decision your move to north would likely depend on ability of King to

                            There is strong sentiment there for what King is trying to do provided

                        <p>2771. 1. At request of Pattakos, I went to Pentagon at 1:15 a.m. local to
                            meet with Generals Angelis, <persName corresp="#p_ZGG1">Zoitakis</persName>, and Pattakos and <persName>Colonels
                                Papadopoulos</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_MLCN1">Makarezos</persName>, and Paleologopoulos [<hi rend="italic">Paleologos</hi>?] and Under Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            Christopoulos.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>, in his new role of Prime Minister,
                            began conversation by asking whether I had heard this evening's radio
                            announcements of government and whether I had any comment to make on
                            today's developments. I replied that I heard not only announcements of
                            government but also message of King. Then, as authorized by Department,
                            I proceeded to read verbatim from first part of Embtel 2751.<note n="2" xml:id="d348fn2">
                                <ref target="#d346">Document 346</ref>.</note> Elaborating on themes
                            in this message, I reminded <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and others
                            that only recently my government had exerted great effort to prevent
                            conflict in this part of Mediterranean, at times bloodshed had seemed
                            inevitable but was avoided only at last minutes. Now once more we have
                            reached <pb n="712" xml:id="pg_712" facs="0750"/>point where blood could
                            be spilled—this time in a civil conflict which would be even more
                            tragic. Surely something could be done to avert such a catastrophe. I
                            also said I was under instructions to convey this same message to the
                            King and to urge both sides to resolve differences peacefully through
                            negotiation.</p>
                        <p>3. In response, <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> adopted self-righteous
                            position that his government had in no way misbehaved and that it was
                            King and <persName corresp="#p_KC1">Kollias</persName> who, suddenly
                            without warning, left Athens to overthrow revolution. His government, on
                            other hand, had acted properly, even following Constitution in
                            appointing regent. It was King's, not Athens government, which had
                            created present crisis and danger of bloodshed.
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>, backed by several of his
                            colleagues, repeatedly insisted they had complete control of Greek armed
                            forces, as well as support of all social classes.</p>
                        <p>4. I commented we are now faced with critical situation involving what
                            are claimed to be two governments, each side claiming loyalty and
                            support of people and armed forces. We are not in position to judge
                            merits of conflicting claims, but existence of two governments obviously
                            would create potential disaster for Greece, as well as legal questions
                            for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. For example, what is position
                            of King? Has he abdicated, in their view?</p>
                        <p>5. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> argued that, by leaving Athens and
                            disappearing, King had “abandoned” his duties as Monarch. Therefore,
                            according to Constitution, government had appointed regent in his place.
                            I replied that this interpretation would be difficult for me to persuade
                            my government and others to accept, particularly since King had left
                            Athens only some hours earlier and, as far as I knew, is still in Greece
                            and is acting in accordance with Constitution. Christopoulos broke in to
                            assert that there might be legal question if two governments should
                            actually exist, but events would soon prove there is in fact only one
                            government, i.e., that of <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>
                            <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>. I warned them, however, that I could
                            foresee difficult legal problem.</p>
                        <p>6. Immediate issue, though, was how to avoid internal conflict and strife
                            in Greece. How did they believe it could be avoided? Pattakos' first
                            reaction was that it was not their responsibility as they had not
                            created problem. I reminded them that <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> had heard this same remark twenty times a day for
                            twelve days during Cyprus crisis. As he had repeatedly answered, need
                            was not to apportion responsibility but to avoid tragedy. Pattakos then
                            indicated that they would be willing to communicate with King if they
                            knew where he was. General Angelis, however, immediately tended to knock
                            possibility of negotiations by stating flatly King had crossed river and
                            burnt his bridges behind him. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> implied
                            that there was no need for negotiation as his government had complete
                            control of country. I again stressed that, though <pb n="713" xml:id="pg_713" facs="0751"/>we are not in position to judge rival
                            claims, my government, including specifically Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> who now at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> table, is most anxious about danger of bloodshed and
                            that we hope every effort can be exerted to avoid strife. I would
                            naturally inform <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> of this meeting and
                            would be available any time for additional talks.</p>
                        <p>7. Junta officers, as well as Angelis, <persName corresp="#p_ZGG1">Zoitakis</persName>, and Christopoulos, gave the [<hi rend="italic">no</hi>] sign of friction among them and attempted portray air of
                            confidence. Pentagon itself was reasonably calm, though additional
                            guards were posted inside and outside building.</p>

                        <p>2807. First installment possible effects of King's abortive
                            countercoup.</p>
                        <p>1. This estimate will doubtless be revised as the specific events of
                            December 13/14 become known.</p>
                        <p>2. King Constantine's abortive attempt to overthrow April 21 coup
                            government has wrought change on Junta's future options. The new
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> government would now appear to be
                            undisputed master of Greece, with no potential internal check on its
                            tenure or its programs.</p>
                        <p>So long as the King remained a factor in internal political equation,
                            there existed possibility that King could exercise a certain measure of
                            control over Junta and in extreme circumstances it was believed that he
                            had capability to oust Junta with support from certain loyalist army
                            elements in the north. With King now out of country, and clear
                            demonstration that Junta is in ultimate control of armed forces that
                            count, hardliners in Junta will doubtless conclude there is no obstacle
                            to indeterminate rule by <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and
                            company.</p>
                        <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0752"/>
                        <p>3. Other pressures that existed before December 13 which were being
                            exerted toward a restoration of constitutional representative government
                            in Greece continue with undiminished potential: US Government, <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, Western opinion in general, and
                            international climate. Presumably these can have some effect on Junta's
                            program for a restoration of normality. However, there is no ace in
                            hole, no possible alternative to coup group, since a different
                            government could only be imposed by military intervention from abroad,
                            which is apparently inconceivable. Some elements of Junta therefore will
                            now attempt more confidently to enjoy prospect of setting own timetable,
                            with assurance that no one can forcibly change schedule or “force” them
                            to do anyone's bidding.</p>
                        <p>4. Question which should become more clear in next several days is
                            whether <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and company will now take a
                            more relaxed attitude toward constitutional reform and an eventual
                            return to a parliamentary system through elections or feel “events” have
                            put them on their metal. First inclination will doubtless be to think
                            that since they can't be forced out, why should they be in a hurry to
                            leave. And therefore they would probably focus on trying to carry out
                            their revolutionary program of reforming the administration, making
                            bureaucracy efficient, changing habits and working methods of Greek
                            people, and generally “shaping up” country. Regime's leaders might be
                            more willing to use strong measures to effect changes they desire, since
                            they no longer need be as sensitive to anyone else's opinion. Alternate
                            pressure will be that “incident” has challenged “honor” (filotimo) of
                            national government and Junta must prove Constantine was wrong in
                            prognostication in his appeal that they were not interested in
                            constitutional reform and implementation.</p>
                        <p>5. Effect on Greek people of more stringent measures being used by Junta
                            and apparent lack of any realistic alternative to present regime may be
                            to polarize populace increasingly into regime supporters and opponents,
                            with a diminishing category of apathetics. This would not in immediate
                            future mean activation of larger group of activists (bomb throwers etc.)
                            in opposition. Oppositionists who looked to King to “do something” or
                            expected that foreign pressure would eventually cause government to fall
                            or give up power will now, in some numbers, decide they must turn to
                            direct action against government in one fashion or another. However even
                            elements who favor comparing dangers of WW II resistance and now—when
                            Communists took over active resistance movement in mountains—find it
                            difficult to forecast development activist resistance movement of this
                            type. This particularly true since Greeks of WW II resistance forces
                            were not necessarily from sophisticated urban groups (who are trying be
                            “articulate” opposition at present) but from peasants who had double
                            motivation—foraging for food and shoot it out tradition with
                            “government” of whatever mark existed. In the end, <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0753"/>
                            <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> government, by its new demonstration
                            of strength, determination and staying power will probably gain
                            tolerance of many Greeks whose primary political instinct is to find
                            which way the wind is blowing and then to bend with it, in other words
                            to join ranks with the apparently winning side.</p>

                        <p>86871. 1. King Constantine telephoned to Secretary at 9 a.m. EST December
                            19 to report that messenger Ch. Potamianos returning to Athens. King's
                            views were that there should be firm date for plebiscite on constitution
                            and date for elections set by the junta. Constitution was not an issue
                            because he did not know what was in it. He had to insist on precise
                            dates.</p>
                        <p>2. King expressed hope US would not recognize <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> unless he returns as safeguard that things will be
                            implemented. He hoped <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and others would
                            also put pressure on <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> using means at
                            their command.</p>
                        <p>3. He said he was considering possibly going back without further
                            negotiation. (<hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This brainstorm may have
                            grown out of his talk with Caramanlis and others who have advised him to
                            go back before it was too late.)</p>
                        <p>4. Secretary did not comment on this idea. He also did not commit himself
                            concerning King's request to link US recognition with King's return to
                            Greece, saying that question would require study.</p>
                        <p>5. King concluded conversation by stating he would not be making press
                            statement today.</p>
                        <p>6. We have reviewed carefully question of US-Greek relations and do not
                            want to get into the middle in negotiating question of King's possible
                            return. Obviously the Greek Government is in the driver's seat and not
                            ready to pay much of a price, if any, for King's return. At same time we
                            want to strike a blow with Greek regime for principles of early
                            plebiscite on constitution and a firm commitment concerning elections.
                            We want to use leverage of US relationship with Greece in current
                            circumstances <pb n="716" xml:id="pg_716" facs="0754"/>to maximum degree
                            as an additional tool in achieving our basic goal of bringing Greece
                            back to democratic life as soon as possible, irrespective of what King
                            may decide to do.</p>
                        <p>7. We would like you to get in touch informally and quietly with
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> or Pattakos (rather than <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> as suggested Athens 4175 [<hi rend="italic">2859</hi>]).<note n="2" xml:id="d350fn2">Telegram 2859
                                from Athens, December 20, recommended that the King make no

                                and the Junta. (Ibid., POL 23–9 GREECE)</note> Say that current
                            developments have complicated for us our relations with Greece, but that
                            this was already difficult for basic reasons which remain a serious
                            obstacle to the kind of relations we would like to have with a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partner and traditional friend. We
                            see little chance for a satisfactory relationship until progress is made
                            on removing these problems, which can be described in general as the
                            continuing lack of convincing movement toward the restoration of a
                            constitutional situation. Involved are such issues as firm and early
                            dates for a plebiscite on the constitution and elections, restrictions
                            on the press, and the resolution of political prisoner cases in
                            accordance with due process of law. Add that the strength of opinion of
                            the American people and their elected representatives on these issues
                            prevents the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> from having a normal
                            relationship with Greece, and that accordingly we are anxious to see
                            Greece make decisive progress toward constitutionality.</p>
                        <p>8. If you are asked whether the US intends to recognize the <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, you should say that no decision has
                            been taken pending clarification status of King; you should leave no
                            doubt that basic problem for us continues to be undemocratic nature of
                            regime itself. FYI. We prefer leave situation imprecise for awhile,
                            although we recognize contact with <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> or
                            Pattakos might be considered a step toward recognition; we hope it can
                            be done in a manner to minimize such an interpretation.<note n="3" xml:id="d350fn3">In telegram 2892 from Athens, December 20,

                                on the organization of the “Turkish Cypriot Provisional
                                Administration” and the issuance of regulations by that

                        <p>1. Acting <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Araouzos called me to
                            Ministry half hour ago as first of Chiefs of Mission all of whom he will
                            see today. Subject, as we expected, was government decision to consider
                            further visits by Chiefs of Mission to officials of new “Administration”
                            as recognition of “flagrantly unlawful act” by Turk Cypriots. Araouzos
                            said that GOC “cannot agree to any visits by Chiefs of Mission to
                            officials of the new executive council.” If the GOC were to give assent
                            to “official visits” this would merely encourage Turks to take further
                            steps of separative nature. He said that in past visits by Ambassadors
                            and Charges to Kuchuk and other “officials” had been considered for
                            convenience as merely visits to leaders of Turk Cypriot community. The
                            GOC could no longer maintain this fiction and therefore could not agree
                            to any further visits. There could only be one government in Cyprus and
                            that government could not condone recognition of the “new Turk Cypriot
                            Administration.”</p>
                        <p>2. In response my question Araouzos said that this rule did not apply to
                            members of the staff of the Embassy. I remarked that I thought this was
                            essential since I believed in the past our contacts with Turk Cypriot
                            community had been of value in defusing various incidents and in general
                            reducing tension.</p>
                        <p>3. Araouzos said somewhat apologetically that he recognized this action
                            by the GOC would present us with certain difficulties but that the
                            decision had been taken with the feeling that they had no choice.
                            Speaking personally and without instructions I offered the opinion that
                            this action might prove to be ill- advised in that it gave unwarranted
                            recognition to an action which I and my government did not consider very
                            much more than a mere institutionalizing of a situation that had existed
                            de facto for some time. This was in fact a recognition of the existence
                            of a separate entity in the Turkish Cypriot sector and in that respect
                            at least the action in a sense strengthened the Turkish position. In
                            accordance State 91488,<note n="3" xml:id="d351fn3">Telegram 91488,

                            expressed our view that timing of Turk Cypriot move regrettable in view

                            that for once I agreed with Communist newspapers this morning which had
                            urged government to proceed with normalization despite Turk action. I
                            hoped that now that government had apparently reached decision that
                            normalization in its best interests it would not allow this unfortunate
                            event to interfere with implementation of program.</p>
                        <p>4. I closed our conversation with statement that I would report GOC
                            decision to my government and would presumably receive instructions.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_HICOM1">HICOM</gloss>er who followed me to
                            FonMinistry. Costar said he had same record played to him and was
                            requesting instructions from his government. Of course this poses
                            greater problem to Brits in view their status Guarantor Power.
                            Nevertheless, Costar agrees with me that there would appear to be little
                            choice but to acquiesce in GOC ruling. He, however, is not offering
                            opinion to London and will merely await their decision. He reminded me
                            that we will have to face problem Jan. 1 when Kuchuk gives his
                            traditional Bayram “at home.” Members of corps have in past paid their
                            respects and as matter of fact, I have traditionally gone to sign his
                            book on New Year's day after calling on Archbishop. Under circumstances
                            I consider it inadvisable to make calls this year and <gloss target="#t_DCM1">DCM</gloss> will sub for me.<note n="4" xml:id="d351fn4">In telegram 91621, December 30, the Department of

                        <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>I deem it imperative today to expose to you officially and with due
                            responsibility the causes, the aims, and the prospects of the Revolution
                            of April 21st, 1967. I take this step, prompted by the hope that certain
                            misunderstandings as to the nature of the change that has taken place in
                            Greece will thus be cleared. These I consider detrimental to the
                            interests of both nations concerned, as well as to the Free World.</p>
                        <p>Our country is honored as the cradle of Democracy. This very fact has
                            placed all powers friendly to Greece, as well as all champions of
                            Democracy in an embarrassing position. The regime which existed before
                            the present change, however, had no relation whatsoever with Democracy.
                            It was a regime of factious debauchery, unrestrained demagogy and
                            disintegrating corruption.</p>
                        <p>It had three basic characteristics: a steady fall toward economic
                            collapse, an ever-increasing deterioration of all institutions, and the
                            menacing erosion caused by Communism in political parties, in the press,
                            in a part of society, and in the government itself. In this corner of
                            Europe, as you well know, Communism has thrice tried to seize power by
                            revolutions which steeped the country in blood. The last (1946–1949)
                            would have inevitably made a captive of Greece behind the Iron Curtain
                            if the United States of America had not materially helped my greatly
                            menaced country.</p>
                        <p>The Revolution of April 21st, 1967, took place on the eve of certain
                            civil war—the inevitable result of the elections set for May 28. These
                            elections, whatever the verdict at the polls, would not have solved the
                            ever growing crisis. On the contrary, they would have brought it to an
                            explosive climax. And in the midst of the nightmarish chaos that would
                            have ensued, only the Communist Party—the sole organized power besides
                            the Army—would have prevailed. Its persistent attempts to descend to the
                            Mediterranean and annihilate the eastern flank of the Atlantic Treaty
                            would have been crowned with success.</p>

                        <p>Those who undertook the responsibility to restrain this process at the
                            very last minute, have an individual record of more than ten years'
                            struggle against every shade of Totalitarianism in favor of Freedom and
                            Democracy. They have never thought of imposing a personal regime. Their
                            awareness of responsibility—so lacking in others—as well as their
                            sensitiveness as perceptors of the people's anxiety, due to their origin
                            as members of the armed forces, urged them toward this venture.</p>
                        <p>The success of this venture, without any bloodshed—a success unique in
                            the annals of world history—is clear proof that the imposed change was
                            an expression of the wishes of a great majority of the Greek people. The
                            latest events (the counter revolution of December 13, headed by the
                            Sovereign of the State himself) constituted a second test for the
                            Revolution, proving once more its necessity, its sway over the people,
                            and its absolute de facto stability.</p>
                        <p>On the solemn occasion of this my written communication with you, I wish
                            to assure the President of the United States of the following:</p>
                        <p>It is not the intent of the Revolution to impose a permanent regime, at
                            variance with the fundamental principles proclaimed and championed by
                            the Free World—headed by the United States of America.</p>
                        <p>The suspension of only a certain number of articles of the 1952
                            Constitution is temporary. A new Constitution, brought up to date, will
                            eventually be given to the Greek people, no later than 1968.</p>
                        <p>The regime of this country—Democracy together with a hereditary Sovereign
                            (Constitutional Monarchy)—will remain unaltered.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the Revolution has accomplished its mission, that is, as soon
                            as it has set the foundations for the economic development of the
                            country, brought the functions of the government up to date, and
                            safeguarded the democratic institutions from the Communist menace, it
                            will call upon the Greek people to elect its deputies in a free, general
                            and secret vote.</p>
                        <p>The National Government would willingly set the date of the country's
                            entrance into the smooth course of representative government, rid of all
                            the ugliness and dangers of the past, if this were practically possible
                            and psychologically advisable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. President,</p>
                        <p>When the Revolution of April 21st took place, Greece was much in the same
                            state as Czechoslovakia had been before February 1948. Ever since World
                            War II, Communism has coveted Greece for strategic and other reasons.
                            This is why Communism has so actively stirred world propaganda against
                            our National Government, thus influencing—as you know far better than
                            myself—a large number of non-Communist elements who shape politics and
                            form public opinion in the Free World.</p>
                        <pb n="721" xml:id="pg_721" facs="0759"/>
                        <p>In this address to you today, the Greek Government hopes that both its
                            professions and its assertions will be duly estimated, and that its
                            sincere devotion to its allies and to the principles of the Free World
                            will meet with due response from the Government of the United States of
                            America.</p>
                        <p>On the occasion, please allow me to express my best wishes for the New
                            Year.</p>

                        <p>3099. 1. Mr. and Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                Papandreou</persName> called on me at home January 8. Andreas seemed
                            well, vigorous, responsive and as articulate as ever.<note n="2" xml:id="d353fn2">On December 23, 1967, the Junta announced that it
                                would be releasing <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas
                                    Papandreou</persName> and other political prisoners. On January
                                2, Margaret Papandreou requested a meeting with Talbot in order for
                                her husband to discuss his future plans. In telegram 2929 from
                                Athens, December 23, Talbot raised the likelihood that Andreas would
                                request a visa to return to the United States and outlined means of
                                arranging the most “expeditious” issuance of a non-emigrant visa.
                                (Ibid.)</note> He dismissed his fainting spell several days earlier
                            as not important or serious but rather as an incidental effect on his
                            metabolism of excitement of being released. Similar incidents had
                            occurred in past years. He said he had not been mistreated in jail but
                            that eight months of confinement with armed guards always physically
                            present has inevitably taken their toll and his strength and energy were
                            naturally reduced. He was now rebuilding them. Worst period in prison
                            was last twenty-four hours after amnesty had been announced but before
                            he was certain it would apply to him.</p>
                        <p>2. Since his release he had discussed possible future plans with his
                            family but not with anyone else before this conversation. He found many
                            reasons to stay in Greece, but he would then have to remain close to
                            home and concentrate on writing since any serious contacts with old
                            friends and associates would be subject to misunderstanding by regime.
                            Also so long as he remained in Greece he would be a factor and possibly
                            an embarrassment to regime causing it to act more defensively. Thus
                            without <pb n="722" xml:id="pg_722" facs="0760"/>inflating his own
                            importance, he had come to feel that perhaps the regime could move more
                            freely toward constitutionalism once he had left the country. In any
                            event, he had decided to return to United States. He had applied for a
                            Greek passport and had reason to think it [garble—would] be forthcoming
                            shortly. If so, he would like to start promptly for the United States. I
                            told him we could give him visa quickly. We also discussed possible
                            effect on him of Supreme Court decision in Afroyim case. I explained
                            that Court had not ruled on questions involving a citizen who took
                            Ministerial oath of allegiance to foreign sovereign and that therefore
                            decision could not be presumed to have given him fresh claim to U.S.
                            citizenship. Any administrative or further judicial interpretation
                            could, of course, modify this position, but as of this date no such
                            finding had been made. Andreas asked if his acceptance of Greek passport
                            now would reduce his prospect of resuming American citizenship in event
                            of later broad construction of Afroyim decision. I responded that to
                            best of my knowledge it would not.</p>
                        <p>3. Papandreou said he had decided that for indefinite future, “which
                            could be very long time,” he would abandon political activities and
                            return to academic career which would now be focussed on broader
                            developmental economics than on his earlier mathematical econometric
                            specialty. With several university offers in hand, he had ruled out
                            Middle Western possibilities (Minnesota, Northwestern) but had not yet
                            decided whether to go back to California or another West Coast
                            institution or to settle on East Coast. It would depend on kinds of
                            contacts he might have in one place or other.</p>
                        <p>4. Our talk, which has relaxed and friendly throughout, also included
                            candid discussion of some of Andreas' past activities and his appraisal
                            of present prospects in Greece. Ostensible purpose of call, however, was
                            to express thanks for Embassy's intervention “to save my life” on first
                            night of April coup and thereafter. Andreas said he was aware of my
                            approaches to coup leaders and Embassy's concern for his family and
                            deeply appreciated our interest. I commented that Embassy had been
                            prepared to offer assistance to his family if need arose, particularly
                            if he or they should ever appear to be in imminent danger, but happily
                            this had not been necessary. We discussed how much he may have been in
                            actual danger of being killed. I suggested that although I was grateful
                            for his appreciation of Embassy's efforts, in fact maximum danger had
                            probably come immediately during his arrest, before Embassy knew what
                            was going on. Once regime had him in custody and world knew it, any
                            physical attack on him would have been hard to justify. Certainly we had
                            not discovered any indication that regime ever planned to execute him.
                            Papandreou agreed with this assessment. Pattakos had told him junior
                            members of Junta wanted to get rid of him but that Pattakos had
                            overruled them. When after forty-eight hours or so Andreas understood
                                <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0761"/>that there were no
                            political killings, he felt his own situation much safer. It could
                            however have been different story if top coup leadership had lost
                            control to more activist juniors.</p>
                        <p>5. Throughout this phase of our conversation, Andreas made repeated
                            references to comfort he had gained by knowing <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> and Embassy maintained lively interest in his
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>6. While in prison Andreas had thought through events between July 15,
                            1965 and April 21, 1967, he said. He had come to see situation from
                            perspective of Greek state as a whole without partisan distortions. Now
                            that that phase had passed, and he could talk without sounding as if he
                            were trying to make marks for future, he wanted to make clear what
                            position he had held vis-a-vis United States, since he felt there had
                            been misunderstandings between him and American Embassy and perhaps some
                            bias in reporting. Ever since 1961 he had believed Embassy and State
                            Department had favored Greek rightists and strong role for King. He
                            reminded me that he had asserted this to me in Washington after Greek
                            elections of 1961, which he felt had been distorted not by domestic
                            influences alone (a delicately-phrased assertion that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had intervened in those elections).
                            Whatever Embassy may have thought in 1965–66 and 1966–67, he had never
                            advocated departure of King from Greece but merely limitation of King's
                            ambition to play <persName corresp="#p_DGC1">de Gaulle</persName> by
                            precise delimitation of Royal powers. Also, he had never advocated
                            departure of Greece from Western Alliance; on contrary, Greece unlike
                            Tito's Yugoslavia could not survive neutralism because its position
                            would not permit this. Finally, whatever criticisms of United States
                            policy he had made, he had not attacked U.S. policies as an enemy but
                            rather as member of family. Having been an American citizen, he had felt
                            he could be as frank as Senators <persName corresp="#p_Fulbright1">Fulbright</persName> and Morse without putting into question his
                            basic belief that United States and Greece must continue closely
                            together.</p>
                        <p>7. I told Papandreou I accepted these statements. From our point of view,
                            Embassy (and I as former newspaperman accustomed to importance of
                            separating news from editorial opinion) had tried to maximum extent
                            possible to avoid bias. His father and he had asserted to me early in my

                            not known at first hand. I was confident he would agree that in 1965–67
                            period Embassy had maintained close contacts with Center Union and I
                            personally had seen his father quite frequently as well as other
                            prominent members of party. Andreas acknowledged that. I went on to
                            observe that he should know that in 1960's, at least (which only period
                            I could speak of personally, not having previously been in government
                            service), both Presidents Kennedy and <persName>Johnson</persName> had
                            determined firmly that there should be one <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0762"/>United States policy in a country. It was thus
                            unrealistic to speak of separate diplomatic, military and intelligence
                            policies. Papandreou interjected that he was glad to hear “this
                            important statement.” I continued that while Andreas and his father had
                            both assured me that they followed same policies despite differences in
                            style, I had subsequently concluded that in fact there were substantive
                            differences between them. Andreas acknowledged that he and his father in
                            the end had disagreed on policy points. He reiterated, however, that
                            this had nothing to do with their joint view of the importance of the
                            American connection. His own strategy had been to try to detach as large
                            a faction as possible from the Communist-front <gloss target="#t_EDA1">EDA</gloss> Party in order to assure an electoral victory for the
                            Center Union. He admitted this was a risky policy, but felt that he
                            could have carried it off despite his father's doubts.</p>
                        <p>8. Andreas spoke of American influence in Greece and the importance of
                            getting this country back on constitutional lines. I responded that in
                            early Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan period American influence had
                            apparently sometimes been used tactically, to extent of insistence upon
                            broad-based government to carry out reconstruction and development
                            programs. However, as with other countries well along development trail,
                            in recent years we had held that Greece itself (rather than outsiders)
                            must be mainly responsible for its political, economic, and social
                            development, and that we could no more take responsibility for its
                            failures than for its successes. It was on this basis, that we had not
                            intervened with King last spring to set up temporary government that
                            would have sidetracked elections and presumably averted military coup.
                            Similarly, at present stage, we are not in position to tell Greece what
                            kind of government it should have. Papandreou commented that in many
                            ways this is a pity, since present rulers of Greece need advice. I noted
                            that no one in Greece is unaware of fact that Americans would find
                            repugnant any permanent military dictatorship in Europe in 1960's. Key
                            policy question for us, I added, is whether gradual restoration of
                            democratic and parliamentary rule is more likely to be accomplished if
                            allies turn their backs on Greece at present juncture of work with
                            government of day. Papandreou said that not even while in prison had he
                            ever suggested U.S. should not recognize this Greek government, nor
                            would he now. In his view delicate task for U.S. would be to work with
                            present regime while letting Greeks know our purpose is to urge country
                            toward restoration of constitutionalism. I noted this is precisely
                            posture we developed after April 21 coup.</p>
                        <p>9. I noted that in U.S. Andreas would find American public opinion toward
                            Greece sharply divided, with important elements of academic community
                            taking different line from other significant groups such as major
                            Greek-American organizations. On how best to deal with present
                            situation, Andreas again said he had been doing much thinking in prison,
                                <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0763"/>and that we could count on
                            him not to exacerbate policy attitudes in U.S. He recognizes that
                            present regime is well in saddle, that any immediate opposition would
                            seem likely to be generated only by more extreme elements within
                            revolutionary group, which would be worse than present leadership, and
                            that restoration of constitutional patterns might take long time. I
                            mentioned Turkish experience of plebiscite on first anniversary of
                            military takeover in 1960, followed by elections six months thereafter
                            and then for some time by a civilian government under shadow of military
                            veto before parliamentary institutions firmly reestablished. While
                            Greece is not Turkey, I hazarded view this country might be in for
                            similar process. If constitutional referendum held within next six to
                            eight months and first elections within year thereafter, this would not
                            necessarily be bad. Andreas commented that process should not be allowed
                            to lag too long but also that there danger in trying to push it too fast
                            because junior officers might react to strong pressures by refusing to
                            permit any progress at all. He felt present group, despite its power
                            position, is insecure and uncertain. Because of this, I said we had for
                            some time felt it important that the regime commit itself to
                            constitutional progress at least one step at a time. Now a
                            constitutional draft had been produced practically within promised six
                            months framework, and inclusive dates had been announced within which
                            referendum would be held. This constitutes progress of sorts though we
                            can make no substantive judgments about prospects without seeing
                            constitutional draft as produced by Mitrelias Commission and as revised
                            by government. Before chance to appraise rigidity or liberality of
                            government's draft, I personally would doubt wisdom of pressing for
                            fixed date for elections. Andreas said he agreed fully.</p>
                        <p>10. The Papandreous promised to let me know as soon as they get definite
                            word about his passport. Department will be advised when visa
                            application received.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> invited me to his home
                            January 10. We talked two hours, covering both Cyprus (septel)<note n="3" xml:id="d354fn3">Telegram 3131 from Athens, January 11.

                            forthcoming as he had been during our intensive discussions in November
                            and early December. He grasps our concerns about status and intentions
                            of current <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> and I believe will be
                            helpful in Cabinet discussions.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> first reviewed his own
                            movements after moment at <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Ministerial when he learned of King's attempted countercoup, whose
                            illogicality had flabbergasted him. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>
                            telephoned him three times and King once in Brussels. En route home he
                            stopped in Rome to see King, whom he found dispirited yet still defiant.
                            Pipinelis urged King to return to Greece immediately, as
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> had proposed on day following
                            King's departure. King's refusal was mistake, in <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> view.</p>
                        <p>3. On return to Athens <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>
                            found reorganized government already proceeding with business and
                            committed to pursuing agreement with Turkey. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> agreed to continue in government because he
                            believed its leaders were sincere in their announced intentions to
                            cleanse country and restore parliamentary rule. He still believes they
                            are. Indeed, his relations with governmental leaders have become not
                            only friendly but even easier than with his colleagues in Kanellopoulos
                            government last year.</p>
                        <p>4. I told <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> we regret even
                            temporary break in close and cordial relations we have enjoyed with
                            Greece for many years. We continue to regard our association with Greek
                            ally as important, and I personally am confident way can be found over
                            present barriers to resumption of normal business. It was in that spirit
                            that I had wished to discuss situation with him.</p>
                        <p>5. As background to questions I wanted to pose, I described repugnance
                            found in United States to idea of any military takeover in Europe <pb n="727" xml:id="pg_727" facs="0765"/>in 1960's, extra difficulties
                            caused us by apparent withdrawal of Royal umbrella that had more or less
                            legitimized April 21 revolutionary government, and uncertainties being
                            expressed in US about reality of constitutional progress. I noted that
                            many of those who would most strongly oppose any <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> decision to work normally with present <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> were drawn from same circles as
                            opponents of President's Viet-Nam policy and that this added sensitivity
                            to problem. In these circumstances it would be helpful if we could be
                            enlightened on specific plans accepted by <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> for constitutional advance as well as precise
                            information on status of King and Regent in relation to government.</p>
                        <p>6. In response <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> made
                            following comments:</p>
                        <p>(1) Constitutional draft. Draft produced by Mitrelias commission was
                            surprisingly close to <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName> draft constitution of 1963, he said. In basic
                            concepts it introduced few—too few, in <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> view—changes from existing Constitution. Any
                            fair-minded person would call it not only democratic but liberal. After
                            draft was presented to government December 23, copies were circulated to
                            Ministers with instructions to make comments in writing by January 6.
                            This had now been done. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>
                            himself had recommended inter alia some changes designed to draw higher
                            quality persons into Parliament. He does not yet know what others have
                            recommended. He believes Ministerial proposals would be studied very
                            rapidly and is fairly confident that a final draft will be promulgated
                            in near future—meaning some weeks rather than months. I commented on
                            rumors that government has now decided to hold back plebiscite until
                            last possible date mentioned by <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>,
                            September 15. Pipinelis responded that on contrary he believes <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would find a way to hold plebiscite
                            perhaps not on first declared date, April 21 (which is Orthodox Easter),
                            but near then. I told <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> it
                            would be helpful to us to be able to see Mitrelias constitution. He took
                            note.</p>
                        <p>(2) Date of elections and initiation of parliamentary government.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> thinks leaders
                            themselves have not yet settled on date of initial elections. Many
                            uncertainties remain, such as whether revolutionary Ministers will
                            create their own political movement and run for office. Moreover, in his
                            view, it would be very serious mistake to set election date at this
                            stage of present government. From moment elections declared, no matter
                            how distantly, political elements in country would start jockeying for
                            advantage and moral authority of present government would be lost. It
                            always happens thus in Greece. But this would be great misfortune in
                            present circumstances, because this government has much important work
                            to accomplish before leaving office—work of cleansing and reconstruction
                            that an ordinary political government would probably not have will or
                            strength to tackle successfully. To <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>, for allied governments to press for precise
                            date for Greek election would be error both for foregoing reasons and
                            because it is a superfluous <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0766"/>issue. Once new Constitution adopted in national plebiscite, process
                            of return to elected government would be automatic and irreversible.
                            Comment: From Pattakos statement in interview with Bavarian radio
                            correspondent (septel) and other sources, we understand that ultimate
                            date for elections is integral part of struggle now under way in
                            revolutionary committee between
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>/<persName corresp="#p_MLCN1">Makarezos</persName> and Ladas groups. This tug-of-war appears
                            centered on kinds of revisions to draft Constitution which the
                            hardliners are pushing (see Athens 3122, para 4).<note n="4" xml:id="d354fn4">Dated January 10. (Ibid., POL 16 GREECE)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3) Relaxation of press restrictions and establishment of judicial
                            proceedings for detainees. New press law being prepared. This very
                            important, since Greece must have strong and independent press but
                            cannot afford to go back to morass that was Greek journalism until last
                            April. He could not say when law would be ready, but thinks it likely to
                            come fairly soon. He had nothing specific to report on judicial process
                            for detainees.</p>
                        <p>(4) Roles of King and Regent. For himself, Pipinelis said, it is apparent
                            that government needs King and King needs government. Therefore, he
                            should return soon. He has repeatedly and vigorously made this point to
                            Cabinet. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> has now taken firm line,
                            however, that King should return to Greece but not now because of highly
                            antipathetic feelings in army and general population.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> has been unable to shake
                            government leaders on this point, though he still trying. But this is
                            domestic Greek issue. It is true there was a fault in manner of
                            inducting Regent but this was due to force of circumstances and is
                            domestic question not affecting government's support of monarchy or
                            acceptance of Constantine as King. If any other government has legal
                            problems, it should be enough for that government to perceive that King
                            has explicitly addressed leader of this government as Prime Minister and
                            thus has implicitly also accepted Regent who swore him in. Moreover, if
                            another government should agree that King's role continues important,
                            question is whether it can better help persuade <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> of this fact by avoiding contacts or by reopening
                            working relations. He would strongly argue for latter as more fruitful
                            course. Pipinelis added that question of King's return is exclusively
                            matter of timing. Neither side has put up conditions that it would be
                            difficult for other to accept. Once decision made on date of King's
                            return, it would be simple to find a formula to suit interests of both
                            him and government.</p>
                        <p>7. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> concluded with
                            statement whose import was that he hopes USG can see way clear to
                            restoration of normal business while there still time to influence
                            present group constructively. He sees no reason to make prominent
                            announcement of resumption of business. It <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0767"/>would be possible just to pick up quietly again where
                            matters had left off. This was what German Ambassador had done in
                            calling on him day or two ago, and he hoped others might do it as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>8. I mentioned having heard rumor that <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>
                            is under pressure from his associates to make speech this weekend
                            critical of posture of allies and pointed out it would be regrettable if
                            public statement by high official should further complicate already
                            difficult situation at this stage. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> understood, and promised to speak to
                                <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>. I also mentioned that in
                            situation like present one we find ourselves approached by variety of
                            volunteer intermediaries, as presumably does <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>. One current example is Tom Pappas, who is
                            understandably worried by interruption of direct communication between
                            our two governments. While we appreciate desire of others to be helpful
                            I would like <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> to understand Embassy
                            is not using any non-official as intermediary but prefers to give and to
                            get its impressions in direct contact with leading <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> personalities. Pipinelis took note of
                            this as well.</p>
                        <p>9. We agreed to be ready to meet again in weeks ahead at instance of
                            either of us.</p>

                                preclusive moves by either Greece or Turkey in Cyprus.
                                (Ibid.)</note> Subject: Cyprus planning.</p>
                        <p>1. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>'s point that
                            delay in US initiative creates opportunities for both Greek and Turk
                            Cypriots to make moves that narrow negotiating room is well taken. In
                            fact, establishment of <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> represents
                            just such a preclusive move by Turks-Turk Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether GOC redrafting of Constitution which now underway is designed
                            as preclusive move or not is moot. Certainly there are those <pb n="730" xml:id="pg_730" facs="0768"/>within GOC (including, we suspect,
                                <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>) who will prefer
                            unilateral use of redrafted Constitution, no doubt with appropriate bows
                            in direction of Galo Plaza report, as propaganda and negotiating
                            ploy.</p>
                        <p>3. Less cynical (and probably less likely) interpretation is that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is sincere in his
                            comments to Ambassador that exercise in which GOC now engaged is one of
                            putting thoughts, including autonomy for Turk Cypriots, into revised
                            Constitution which will be advanced as negotiating document and not
                            unilateral initiative. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            desire to use <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forum and his need to be

                            consistent with this interpretation.</p>
                        <p>4. Experience indicates that we should incline to cynical interpretation.
                            Fact that GOC working on revised Constitution leaked to press reinforces
                            view that GOC does intend to proceed in unhelpful manner to rally public
                            support for new Constitution before any talks with Turks-Turk Cypriots
                            can begin.<note n="3" xml:id="d355fn3">In telegram 1152 from Nicosia,

                                telegram evaluated his speech announcing this decision to renew his

                            contains serious elements of compromise, it can always be used in

                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> opened
                            the conversation by stating that he wished to acquaint the Secretary
                            with his views on the Cyprus situation and to learn in turn the
                            Secretary's views. He said the Cypriot Government has sought seriously
                            to find a solution since the November crisis within the framework of
                            procedures established by the Security Council debate. He added that the
                            Cypriot Government has always sought a solution within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> context and that since the end of the
                            Galo Plaza mediation this effort has been made through the Secretary
                            General.</p>
                        <p>We are now faced, he said, with a situation in which the Cyprus
                            Government supports the Secretary General's initiative on both long-term
                            and short-term solutions, but that the Turks are seeking to restrict
                            discussion to “internal security” matters which they say must precede
                            any long term discussions and even then such long term discussions
                            should be outside of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Cyprus, he said, cannot separate internal security from external security
                            though the Government is prepared to start with internal security
                            matters while working for a package deal. Prerequisites he said are (1)
                            removal of Greek Cypriot fears of an attack from outside, and (2)
                            removal of the fear of the Turk-Cypriot minority. He said his Government
                            had presented the Secretary General with four points as comprising the
                            basis of the Cyprus Government plan:</p>
                        <pb n="733" xml:id="pg_733" facs="0771"/>
                        <p>1. A guarantee against external attack.</p>
                        <p>2. Complete withdrawal of Greek and Turkish troops including the
                            contingents.</p>
                        <p>3. Disarmament of all Greek-Cypriot and Turk-Cypriot forces, leaving only
                            the police and <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>4. Discussion of arrangements for effective internal security.</p>
                        <p>Adoption of these four points, he said, should remove the fear of all
                            parties concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that a guarantee against external aggression
                            may be necessary but may not be possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> responded that as
                            long as there is danger of external attack there is increased danger of
                            internal incidents and that if the guarantee is necessary, a way must be
                            found to make it possible. He then said he wished to note new
                            developments: (1) the untimely establishment of the Turkish Cypriot
                            Provisional Administration (<gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss>),
                            established by the Turk Cypriots and Turkish Government officials, which
                            has disturbed the possibilities for internal improvement and evidences
                            continued plans for partition; (2) the decision of President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to seek a new mandate and to
                            offer new solutions for the Cyprus problem to be offered to the
                            Secretary General (these steps, he said, have been necessitated by the
                            aftermath of the crisis and the withdrawal of Greek troops); and (3) a
                            Turkish Aide-mémoire addressed to the UNSYG on the subject of current
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> negotiations on Cyprus.<note n="2" xml:id="d357fn2">Reference is presumably to a January 8 Turkish
                                communication to the Secretary-General. (U.N. Docs. S/8330 and
                                S/8331)</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that his
                            Government took a negative view towards the Aide-mémoire, because it
                            fails to deal with the external danger to Cyprus, makes no mention of
                            withdrawal of Greek or Turkish national contingents, and deals only with
                            internal security, and even in this, tends to affect the substance of
                            the problem by appearing to lead towards partition. He said the Cypriot
                            response to the Aide-mémoire was being postponed until after his talk
                            with the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if bilateral Turkish-Cypriot talks had been
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> agreed that the real
                            question lay between Cyprus and Turkey, but said his Government prefers
                            to deal through the UNSYG. He noted that the issue no longer was enosis,
                            but the independ-ence of Cyprus and the rights of the Turkish minority—a
                            fact which the Turks recognize, while at the same time, they do not want
                            to confirm their recognition of the Cyprus Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked how Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> saw the question of guarantees.</p>
                        <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0772"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said this was a very
                            difficult problem, while suggesting: (1) a special Security Council
                            resolution of guarantee, (2) a U.S. or other single nation guarantee, or
                            (3) a multi-party guarantee; he noted his preference for (1).</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> would be required for a protracted period.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said that even if
                            demilitarization could be completed, the presence of <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> would be required, on a reduced
                            scale, in a symbolic sense until a final solution was achieved.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how the viability and rights of the Turkish Cypriot
                            minority could be assured.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that this
                            could be achieved along the lines of the Galo Plaza report though not so
                            identified because of Turkish objections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            reference to the Turkish Cypriot “Community” was significant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said use of the word
                            “community” was not significant, that the word was used frequently, that
                            what his government objected to was any reference to “two communities”
                            so implying separation or equality. His government, he added, was ready
                            to apply full guarantees and was willing to accept international
                            guarantees for the minority, but Turkey was unwilling.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName>, after being called on
                            by the Secretary, said that our role in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to date has been to support the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> and that we have felt it best to concentrate on the
                            internal problem as a means of achieving lasting peace and creating the
                            right atmosphere for peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> insisted that the
                            internal problem is part and parcel of the whole, that the National
                            Guard, for example, cannot be dismantled without assurances of a
                            guarantee from external attack and withdrawal of the two national
                            contingents. He asserted that a vacuum had been created by the
                            withdrawal of Greek troops and that this vacuum must be filled. He said
                            his government had done much towards normalization and pacification
                            already but cannot go all the way to disarmament without taking care of
                            external dangers first. He said informal talks with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> had clarified that withdrawal of
                            Greek troops is only the first step so there must be a second step, but
                            that the Turks deny this, saying the national contingents are not
                            concerned. He dismissed the Turkish assertion that its national
                            contingent is part of the London-Zurich settlement by asserting: (1)
                            that they had violated the Agreement by moving their troops and (2) in
                            any case, that they were not obliged to keep any troops on Cyprus under
                            the Treaty of Guarantee. He then quipped “What we need is a guarantee
                            against the guarantors”, stating his inability to see <pb n="735" xml:id="pg_735" facs="0773"/>why the Turks could object to a formula
                            embracing neither enosis nor partition.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what will happen when the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> sees the Cypriot reply to the Turkish Aide-mémoire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said he expected that
                            either the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> would continue his
                            negotiations in an effort to find common ground or call a Security
                            Council meeting. He then asked if the U.S. supports the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s good offices and whether the U.S. has
                            proposals for him.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that in good offices proposals are usually not made
                            and, that when made, are offered very quietly in an effort to bring the
                            two parties together.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> asked whether if a
                            quick agreement on the external and internal security issues cannot be
                            reached, the substance of the problem might not be attacked. In this
                            respect, he noted that President <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> is proceeding along these lines.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a series of questions posed by the Secretary, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> clarified that the Cyprus
                            elections are scheduled for February 25, that the Turks can take part in
                            the elections under the 1965 law, but that they do not have to, that he
                            did not expect violence in the elections, that only the office of
                            President will be at issue and that if opposition candidates wish to
                            run, they must announce their candidacies by February 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> asked if there was any
                            way out of the current ban on ambassadorial contacts with the Turkish
                            Cypriot leaders in the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss>, pointing
                            out that the situation requires such contacts.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said the issue is
                            delicate, that he would hope that the Turks could be convinced to
                            abandon the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss>—that if what they say
                            is true, all they need is a committee, not an “administration” including
                            Foreign Affairs, Commerce, Agriculture, Defense, etc.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWJ1">Handley</persName> asked if contacts were
                            possible, if it was clear that these were not with the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> as such.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asserted that it was not very agreeable for Ambassadors to
                            be told that they can't have contacts with others and suggested that
                            maybe we should tell Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> not to have certain contacts here. He stressed
                            that such a ban is contrary to diplomatic custom, except behind the Iron
                            Curtain, and stated his hope that the Foreign Minister would take steps
                            to correct the situation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> interjected
                            that since all agreed that establishment of the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> was a faux pas and since it was deprecated from all
                            sides, the Turks might be persuaded to “climb down” eliminating Foreign
                            Affairs, Defense, etc.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that, due to the ban, we have no Ambassadorial
                            contacts.</p>
                        <pb n="736" xml:id="pg_736" facs="0774"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> then suggested
                            that we talk to the Turks in Ankara.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> next quoted from the
                            past to prove that Kuchuk does not speak for the Turkish Cypriots and
                            that authoritative statements can come only from Ankara. He went on to
                            point out that the Turkish Government refers to the Cypriot Government
                            as the “Greek Cypriot Administration” and to the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> as the “Turkish Cypriot
                            Administration”, so trying to equate their roles.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, at this point, said the U.S. has much more serious
                            problems with Turkey than this and reemphasized the seriousness of the
                            ban, adding that we will be in touch on this matter further.</p>
                        <p>He then asked what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>
                            wanted from us with regard to the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied by asking
                            what should be done if negotiations failed to develop and whether a
                            Security Council meeting should be called.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he didn't believe a meeting of that type with debates
                            would deal effectively with solutions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said that it is
                            necessary for the Greek Cypriots to talk to the Turkish Cypriots and
                            that it is inappropriate for us to become involved with the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>'s negotiations at this point. He
                            stressed the need for progress, noting that an impasse might cause a new
                            crisis, that the <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss> mandate
                            expires March 26 and that the troop contributors are restive.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, noting that the Greeks invented diplomacy, asked if it
                            were not possible for two private individuals to get together for
                            talks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> inquired as to Cypriot
                            delegation's contacts with the Turkish delegation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> replied that contacts
                            were only informal, but were not excluded, even talks with the Turkish
                            Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed that we will remain in touch with the situation
                            and wish to be helpful. He then asked if the Turkish Aide-mémoire was
                            public and how the Cypriots would reply to it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said it was not
                            public and that depending on how the SYG posed it, they might reject it
                            outright or reject it leaving the door open for further discussion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether if the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>
                            proposed Turkish-Cypriot talks, the Cypriots would agree.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> said yes, they
                            would.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RZ1">Rossides</persName> then brought up
                            the subject of the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> again,
                            remarking that it was unfortunate, too formal and a cloak for a
                            “'government” administration.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that we were not informed about it in advance and
                            would have counselled against it had we known in advance.</p>
                        <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0775"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> again said that if
                            the <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> is what the Turks claim, it
                            could be reorganized as a committee. He went on to say that a logical
                            solution to Cyprus must be found, that the mere expectation that one
                            side or the other would reject a solution must not be allowed to
                            jeopardize a solution and that a breakthrough to a logical solution is
                            necessary. This he described as an independent unitary state with rights
                            for the Turkish minority or community. The solution, he said, cannot
                            include both independence and no independence, Greek-Turkish involvement
                            and Greek-Turkish non-involvement, nor any other seeds of division. He
                            asserted that, while the Turks officially reject partition, they always
                            work towards this end and that partition cannot solve the problem.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether if all the Turkish Cypriots had lived in one
                            area, federation could have been possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> simply replied this
                            is not the case.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked, since geographical division is not possible,
                            whether some form of vertical division is possible, noting that a
                            “unitary state” implies to the Turks their own disappearance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName> asserted that equal
                            rights for all plus special rights for the Turk-Cypriots is possible,
                            but that Cyprus cannot go back to the London-Zurich settlement, that the
                            seeds of division must be removed.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed with the Secretary emphasizing that we will keep in
                            close touch with developments.</p>

                        <p rend="sectiontitleital">Discussion:</p>
                        <p>In the last four years we have twice intervened diplomatically to stop a
                            Greek-Turkish war from developing out of the Cyprus dispute. For the
                            last several years, we have refrained from involving ourselves
                            substantively in the issue, preferring the parties to reach agreement
                            among themselves. After <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Cyrus
                                Vance</persName>'s skilled mediation last November succeeded by the
                            narrowest of margins, we have concluded that a new effort must be made
                            to reach a permanent solution of this dangerous problem, and that a
                            major role for the U.S. in this effort is indicated.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the November crisis ended, a Cyprus Study Group, headed by
                            former Ambassador Charles W. Yost, was formed to make recommendations on
                            how the United States could aid in bringing about a settlement. The
                            group's recommendations, which are attached,<note n="3" xml:id="d358fn3">Entitled “Strategy for Negotiation of a Cyprus Settlement,” not
                                printed.</note> have been approved by the Interdepartmental Regional
                            Group headed by Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> and by the Senior Interdepartmental Group under
                            the chairmanship of Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The basic recommendation that emerged is that the United States
                            Government do all in its power to bring about a long-term Cyprus
                            settlement. We believe that the risk of war has increased to the point
                            that our interests are served best by actively promoting an early
                            solution, despite the resentment that our role could conceivably produce
                            in Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey. The parties are still very far apart, and
                            it may well be that only the United States has the influence to bring
                            them together. Chances of settlement are now somewhat better than before
                            the November crisis.</p>
                        <p>Our first step would be to consult with the British and Canadian
                            Governments, which also are strongly interested in settling the Cyprus
                            dispute, and with the United Nations Secretary General, who has already
                            begun discussions with representatives of Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.
                            Depending on the Secretary General's plans for continuing his
                            discussions and his prospects for success, we would then follow one of
                            two courses: strong support for United Nations mediation of a long-term
                            settlement, or support for its mediation of interim measures while we
                            take over the search for a long-term settlement. In the latter case, we
                            would review the situation again before appointing a United States
                            mediator.</p>
                        <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0777"/>
                        <p>Because the need for action is urgent, we would like to begin the course
                            of action recommended by the paper as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows discussion of the <hi rend="italic">Pueblo</hi>
                            incident.]</p>
                        <p>II. The President, in introducing a <hi rend="italic">discussion of the
                                Cyprus problem</hi>, welcomed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> to the Council table and said he wanted to thank
                            him publicly for his efforts last November and December in avoiding a
                            war between Greece and Turkey. He then asked Mr. Battle to summarize the
                            problem for the Council.</p>
                        <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0778"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> said that, while Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s mission had saved us
                            from war, the Cyprus problem remains. New small incidents occur weekly
                            which heighten tension on the island. Next time it will be impossible to
                            hold Turkey back, especially while the Greek internal situation is what
                            it is. Ambassador Yost had reviewed the situation after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>'s return. He concluded—and the
                                <gloss target="#t_IRG1">IRG</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> have concurred—that the situation is unstable and that
                            it is important that we be ready to move in if required. Via the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> mission, we have
                            involved ourselves again in the Cypriot problem. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is now discussing how to tackle the long
                            range problem and we must let the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            effort run its course, but we are not optimistic about what U Thant can
                            achieve and should not let him fail without having something of our own
                            ready to put in his place. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> concluded by saying that he did not want to step
                            into this problem, but he felt we had no choice but to be ready.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HR1">Helms</persName> noted that the Greeks
                            have withdrawn their troops as agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName>, although there are still some
                            1500 on the island as a regular part of the National Guard. He noted
                            that the Greeks claim that 300 Turk officers remain in a similar
                            capacity. There is still no inter-communal cooperation. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' declaration of a
                            Presidential election at the end of February might further inflame the
                                situation.<note n="2" xml:id="d359fn2">
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> made the
                                announcement of elections in a January 12 national radio
                                broadcast.</note> In sum, the situation is still extremely
                            uneasy.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's request, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> summarized his feelings as follows: “The situation
                            is still held together with paste and glue, and more paste than glue.”
                            If it flares up again, war cannot be avoided. The majority of Turks had
                            wanted to go to war in November. The Greek people felt humiliated and
                            many of them are anxious for a chance to have a go at the Turks. The
                            Cypriots are fatalistic.</p>
                        <p>He believed that the US should take an active role in trying to achieve a
                            settlement. The pace of the problem is quicker than the pace of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Secretary General. He hopes the
                            problem can be solved within the framework of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but he is “not sanguine.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> agreed that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would not be able to do the job. He noted
                            one slight opening in the last 24 hours—that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has apparently agreed to
                            discuss his own draft Constitution with the Turkish Cypriots. He shared
                            the prediction that U Thant would be at the end of his road in a few
                            days. The President asked whether there is more that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GA1">Goldberg</persName> could do. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> said the Ambassador had
                            made clear his support of the Secretary General and had urged Cypriots
                            and Turks to get together. He pointed out, however, that the Turks
                            distrust U Thant. The Cypriot Foreign Minister wants to tie the
                            pacification efforts envisioned in the <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> agreement to replace the withdrawn <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0779"/>Greek troops with Cyprus' protection
                            against Turkish invasion. The Turks want to concentrate on pacification
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SJJ1">Sisco</persName> pointed out that the
                            governments contributing troops to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            peacekeeping force are restive and may be reluctant to renew their
                            contributions when the current mandate for the force expires at the end
                            of March unless there is some progress in further implementing the
                                <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> agreement and moving
                            toward a more permanent arrangement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RD1">Rusk</persName> noted that it is
                            time for serious talks with the Turks and Cypriots. He hoped we could
                            move some diplomatic chips in before the next crisis—before we “get to
                            the end of the road.”</p>
                        <p>Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KNB1">Katzenbach</persName> agreed
                            that the time fuse is shorter than the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            process. He noted that we are concerting with the Secretary General in
                            order to avoid being blamed for his failure.</p>
                        <p>In response to the President's request to summarize, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> said that we would be in touch
                            with the Secretary General and the parties concerned over the next few
                            days. However, we would like to get our mediator appointed and briefed
                            quietly in order to have him ready to step in the moment he was
                            needed.</p>

                        <p>3. New Constitution—<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said
                            expects be ready to publish new constitutional draft and announce
                            precise date of plebiscite very soon. Decision “almost made” to publish
                            for full public consideration and comparison texts present Constitution,
                            Mitrelias committee's draft, and government draft based on latter.
                            Following full discussion and possible changes suggested by local and
                            foreign public opinion, and by US Government and/or foreign
                            constitutional law experts if they wish, final text to be submitted to

                        <p>4. Reorganization of state machinery—progress is slow because difficult
                            get at truth amid welter of charges against individuals—“Greek mentality
                            has not changed.” <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said he does
                            not wish do injustice to individuals. However, he determined move ahead
                            and if mistakes are made, will not hesitate rectify even though accused
                            of retreat.</p>
                        <p>5. Resumption full military assistance—<gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> said, while he believed it unjustified, he
                            understood how <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> could afford “luxury
                            policy” of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> suspension prior
                            emergence of Soviet fleet in Eastern Mediterranean. Believes <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> cannot now afford such policy. Greece,
                            he said, can be relied upon, in its geographic area, to do its full
                            share in defense of free world but must have assistance from its
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>6. Cyprus—No new developments, but <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss> somewhat anxious about Turkish motives concerning
                            paragraph 4 <persName corresp="#p_VC1">Vance</persName> agreement. He
                            emphasized that on basis historical evidence Turkish policy not based on
                            sincerity. <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>, he said, must advise

                        <p>7. I explained and PriMin said he understood President and administration
                            extremely busy with other matters.<note n="4" xml:id="d360fn4">In

                            encouraging signs shown in <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>'s recent

                            suspicions created after December 13. He was in affable mood, seemed
                            genuinely pleased with visit, and made no comment on my remark at outset

                            hour much more pleasant than the last time (January 12). He continues to
                            be aware that Greece's earliest possible return to democracy is our

                        <p>2. According to <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>, he and
                            Caglayangil agreed to tackle long-term Cyprus settlement by focussing
                            first on getting for an independent Cyprus a constitution that would be
                            acceptable to both Greek Cypriots and Turk Cypriots. Plan they drew up
                            calls for joint secret request to Canada to convene and chair a
                            four-cornered conference of Greek and Turk <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> to settle constitutional questions but not deal
                            with other outstanding issues. Questions of <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0782"/>Greek military personnel serving with Cypriot National
                            Guard and of treatment of minorities in Greece and Turkey would
                            meanwhile be dealt with under separate procedures that <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> and Caglayangil also
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> emphasized that Canada
                            would be asked to present conference idea as exclusively its own, and
                            that no Cypriots would be informed of secret prior Greek-Turk
                            understanding. He hopes Canada will see its way clear to lead this
                            initiative despite preoccupation of government leaders with forthcoming
                            elections. As he sees desirable scenario, approaches to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> would be made after some days,
                            to reduce chance of Canadian initiative being linked to rumors of
                                <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>-Caglayangil meeting,
                            but four-way meetings would start after Cypriot elections later this
                            month. Pipinelis believes UNSYG will welcome Canadian initiative as
                            alternative to his own flagging efforts to exercise good offices.</p>
                        <p>4. It was improved climate following November crisis that led to his
                            meeting with Caglayangil, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said. Feelings had calmed down in Greece and
                            Turkey, tenseness on island had relaxed, and on January 12 <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had taken constructive step
                            of announcing plans to present a new constitution for Cyprus. However,
                            it became apparent new storm clouds gathering and conditions might again
                            deteriorate. Both he and Caglayangil concluded, therefore, that time had
                            arrived for action. Caglayangil had been good enough to suggest they
                            meet secretly, and <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> had
                            readily agreed despite his doctor's efforts to prevent him from
                            traveling.</p>
                        <p>5. In considering next steps on Cyprus, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> had reasoned that a final settlement would in any case
                            be so difficult that parties must start by concentrating on what aspect
                            most likely to succeed, or least likely to fail. With <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' plan to present
                            Constitution, this had become obvious starting point. Caglayangil agreed
                            with this reasoning, and they had no difficulty in deciding to focus on
                            how to get a constitution for an independent Cyprus that would be
                            agreeable to both Greek Cypriots and Turk Cypriots, leaving all other
                            issues to be handled separately or later.</p>
                        <p>6. At first Pipinelis had proposed that constitutional talks be conducted
                            between Greek Cypriots and Turk Cypriots under aegis of UNSYG. But
                            Caglayangil had rejected this because of Turk distrust of U Thant. Then
                                <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> had proposed that
                            Greek Cypriots and Turk Cypriots be stimulated to meet together by
                            themselves. Caglayangil has found this idea unsatisfactory because “you
                            have a strong advocate on your side and we don't on ours.” Finally they
                            reached agreement on a conference at which Turk and Greek <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss>s, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_KF1">Kutchuk</persName> would all sit together. Caglayangil noted that
                            this was first time a Turkish Foreign Minister had agreed to negotiate
                            directly with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0783"/>
                        <p>7. How should such a conference be convened? <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> was definite that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> should not have reason to think this a put-up
                            job between Greeks and Turks. Initiative would need to come from
                            outside. After considering whether US or <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be well situated to play this role, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> and Caglayangil had concluded
                            it would be better for initiative to come from Canada which naturally
                            interested and involved through <gloss target="#t_UNFICYP1">UNFICYP</gloss>. Thus their secret request to Canada today.
                            Meanwhile they hope US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can stand
                            ready to help as needed. In particular, they hope US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> can encourage <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to see importance of
                            proceeding carefully toward agreement with Turk Cypriots on new
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>8. In response to our questions, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> told Stewart and me that he and Caglayangil
                            had also discussed question of Greek officers and noncoms with Cypriot
                            National Guard. Caglayangil had explained pressures <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> is under to get action. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> had replied that throughout
                            crisis he had known that this was a question Greece could not resolve
                            without agreement of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            and that premature removal of leadership would leave National Guard
                            dangerously undisciplined. However, it of little importance to Greece
                            itself whether few military involved stay on island or return home; he
                            would be prepared to try to get <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' agreement to progressive withdrawal of Greeks.
                                <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> would prefer that in any case as
                            soon as conditions safe and <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> agrees, Sir Michael Stewart then told <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> of <persName corresp="#p_KS2">Kyprianou</persName>'s statement to HMG January 30 that Cypriots
                            acknowledge <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> right to withdraw its
                            military personnel from Cypriot National Guard, and also that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> wants to reduce size of
                            National Guard. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> welcomed
                            this news, especially as <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> told him he would not agree to removal of Greek
                            personnel at this stage. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>
                            indicated he might have another try on this with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> after Cypriot elections.</p>
                        <p>9. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said he and
                            Caglayangil had agreed to establish Ambassadorial-level commission to
                            examine each country's complaints about treatment of minority in other
                            country. Precedent for this exists in Averoff-Zorlu agreement of 1959
                            that activated <persName corresp="#p_BD1">Bitsios</persName>-Kuneralp
                            investigations. These had proved useful though intrusion of Cyprus
                            crisis of that era prevented their implementation. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> thinks similar approach may
                            help Greece and Turkey deal with complaints now being raised about
                            difficulties experienced by Greeks in Istanbul, Imbroz and Tenedos and
                            by Turks in Thrace.</p>

                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> expressed great
                            satisfaction to me today that Canadian initiative now launched.<note n="2" xml:id="d362fn2">Canadian proposals for a quadripartite
                                conference on Cyprus were presented to the Government of Turkey on
                                February 29, and to the Government of Greece on March 1. (Telegrams
                                4186 from Ankara, March 1, and 3753 from Athens, March 1; both

                                3749 from Athens, March 1. (Ibid.) On March 1, the Canadian
                                Government also informed the Secretary-General of its proposals and
                                its intention to sound out the Cypriot Government. (Telegram 3999

                            As <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> had seemed ready to
                            go to U Thant in next few days, Canadians have moved apparently just in
                            time. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> reasonably hopeful
                            Canadian effort will bear fruit, though he said he spends his nights
                            worrying about what could go wrong.</p>
                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> hopes Canadians can
                            obtain not merely acquiescence from UNSYG but solid support which may
                            become necessary to persuade <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept proposal. He hopes U.S. can also help
                            influence <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. I expressed
                            confidence that after idea surfaced we would do what we could within
                            limits of our influence. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>
                            commented that limited influence is everybody's problem in dealing with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, most especially
                            Greece's.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> saw no serious problem
                            about mid-April date for first meeting, though he agreed with my
                            expressed concern that each passing week could give more opportunities
                            for difficulties and accidents. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> showed little concern that either <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> or Turk Cypriots would take
                            separate initiatives in immediate future. While Canadian proposal should
                            give <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> pause, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> evidently counts on his
                            understanding with Caglayangil to hold Turk Cypriots quiet.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>, in <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>' view, has shifted his ground
                            now that all agree enosis not practicable and he can therefore work
                            openly toward independent solution he has privately always favored.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> sees <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as clearly preparing for
                            direct talks with Turks—either with Turk Cypriots or, in end, with
                            Turkey itself with which he must ultimately reach agreement. This is why
                            Canadian initiative stands a chance.</p>
                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> relatively optimistic
                            on ability of parties to reach agreement on terms for a new Cyprus
                            Constitution. Earlier Greek-Turkish dialogue had broken down over
                            international issues, but substantial and useful areas of agreement had
                            nevertheless been achieved on constitutional concepts for Cyprus. These
                            understandings, which Turkish Government <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0785"/>had shown courage in agreeing to, are now available to
                            be built upon.</p>
                        <p>6. Real difficulty ahead, <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>
                            feels, will be question of international guarantee of new Cyprus
                            Constitution. He anticipates Turkey will assert continuing unilateral
                            right of intervention as under London-Zurich treaties, although it knows
                            this would be impossible for an independent Cypriot Government or for
                            Greece to accept. Yet some form of international guarantee or assurance
                            will probably be necessary. This is a void to be filled, and a question
                            to which Pipinelis said he is giving much anxious thought.</p>

                                telegram 125137 to Ankara, March 5, the Department of State reported

                        <p>1. News reftels that Canadian initiative has stalled while UNSYG pushes
                            forward proposal which Turk Cypriots cannot accept at this juncture
                            bound to be very disappointing to <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> Caglayangil. Considerable effort which he and
                                <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> made to set up
                            framework for negotiations whereby all parties reasonably safeguarded
                            has now apparently come to naught although four-sided talks may be
                            revived for future use. <gloss target="#t_FonMin1">FonMin</gloss> will
                            be inclined blame <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> again for coolness
                            to Canadian initiative. He may also conclude he was right when he
                            originally told Canadian Charge (Ankara 4048)<note n="3" xml:id="d363fn3">Dated February 23. (Ibid.)</note> he could not
                            agree to having <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> briefed prior to
                            approaches to four parties to be invited.</p>
                        <pb n="748" xml:id="pg_748" facs="0786"/>
                        <p>2. When Caglayangil finally agreed at <persName corresp="#p_TI1">Turkmen</persName>'s insistence, it was on condition Canadians
                            would not put pressure on him to accept invitation to discuss matter in
                            some sort of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forum. <persName corresp="#p_TI1">Turkmen</persName> also mentioned he wanted similar
                            assurances from US and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> but these were
                            never actually solicited. Nevertheless, we believe US, after strong
                            commitment to Canadian initiative, should not turn around and pressure
                                <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> or Turk Cypriots to agree to
                            UNSYG's proposal. Such action would sit particularly badly with
                            Caglayangil and would weaken whatever influence we have with him. We
                            wonder why, if <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> sent instructions to
                            Osorio-Tafall Feb 29 (Nicosia 1437), he could not have openly so
                            informed Canadian PermRep Ignatieff during meeting Mar 1 (<gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> 3999).<note n="4" xml:id="d363fn4">See <ref target="#d362fn2">footnote 2, Document 362</ref>.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. We have carefully considered whether this might not be good time for
                            resuming Ambassadorial calls on Kuchuk. Following are factors in
                            favor:</p>
                        <p>A. Ambassadorial call would help us out in Ankara while FonMin digesting
                            bad news on Canadian initiative.</p>
                        <p>B. It would closely follow <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Rep Tafall's
                            call on Kuchuk and could therefore be regarded as inquiring into Turk
                            Cypriot views on and responses to Tafall's proposal.</p>
                        <p>C. London 6939<note n="5" xml:id="d363fn5">Dated March 5. (Department of
                                State, Central Files, POL 17 CYP)</note> suggests FonOff embarrassed
                            by extent of delay in resuming calls.</p>
                        <p>D. Excuses for not calling are running thin. First, we tried some kind of
                            language to effect we do not accept legality of <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> or recognize them as government (Nicosia 1143).<note n="6" xml:id="d363fn6">Telegram 1143 from Nicosia, January 12,
                                described the instructions that U.K. High Commissioner Costar had
                                been authorized to present to the Cypriot Government to deal with
                                the issue of Ambassadorial meetings with Turkish Cypriot
                                representatives. (Ibid., POL 17 US–CYP)</note> Secondly, we explored
                            possibility of maximum numbers of Chiefs of Mission defying ban (Nicosia
                                1194).<note n="7" xml:id="d363fn7">Dated January 19. (Ibid.)</note>
                            Thirdly, we decided to wait until after Presidential elections.
                            Fourthly, we waited until Canadian initiative launched in order to give
                            it major support. Re Nicosia 1434<note n="8" xml:id="d363fn8">Not
                                found.</note> we do not feel we should wait until UNSC meeting.</p>
                        <p>4. Factors against Ambassadorial call seem to rest on fear that possible
                            consequences may be (A) PNG action or (B) deep-freeze treatment. Since
                            calls at this time after considerable delay would not appear as
                            challenging to <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>'
                            authority as in January, we wonder whether possibility of PNG action is
                            not now reduced. On other hand, given <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> coolness to any outside initiatives while he still
                            active in field, we think it may be some time before Canadian or other
                            initiative can be started up <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0787"/>again. In other words, deep-freeze treatment may not affect US
                            contacts with Greek Cypriots as long and as adversely as once
                            feared.</p>
                        <p>5. We therefore suggest taking another and urgent look at problem of
                            Ambassadorial calls. Voluntary issuance of disclaimer of recognition of
                                <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> might soften <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' retaliation, if any.</p>

                            and forthcoming Security Council meeting offers most propitious occasion
                            we have yet seen for renewing ambassadorial contacts with Kuchuk.

                            strongly that ambassadorial contacts at this point would be strong asset
                            in getting discussions started with Turkish Cypriots on constitutional
                            proposals. Additional point might be made that restrictions on Turkish
                            Cypriots in Nicosia were maintained in January when restrictions
                            elsewhere lifted because of formation of <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> and logically lifting of ban on contacts, which also
                            was response to establishment of <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss>,
                            should be lifted in parallel.</p>
                        <p>2. In addition, <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> concerned that French

                            <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> In strategic terms I believe we have
                            been on right track with Greece since April 1967 in emphasizing
                            importance of return to constitutionality and representative government.
                            Moreover, given US interests in Greece, absence of acceptable
                            alternative to present regime, and our incapacity to legislate Greece's
                            future, I see no practical alternative, barring accidents, to continuing
                            on same course for at least next six months or so. If this is accepted,
                            our current policy problems are primarily tactical. Here I recommend
                            that we (1) release immediately certain selected defensive and training
                            items on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> suspension list, with
                            further time-phased releases programmed for (A) June (provided <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> then publishes its own constitutional
                            draft in reasonably acceptable form), (B) September (if plebiscite
                            successful), and (C) as quickly thereafter as we can be confident of
                            early implementation of Constitution, and (2) promptly open discussions
                            with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> on FY 68 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> allocations and FY 69–FY 73 planning
                            figures. If political process goes reasonably satisfactorily, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> relationship could be fully restored
                            before end of 1968, which in any case is probably earliest practical
                            timing. In event of impasse or breakdown, <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries could if necessary be stopped again at any
                            point. <hi rend="italic">End summary.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Looking ahead in Greece has rarely been easy but hardly ever more
                            difficult than now. Malaise, as Department observes, currently
                            characterizes both regime and wider public opinion. Strains within
                            revolutionary group arise from growing awareness that it has achieved no
                            glowing public success since its dramatic seizure of power, that its
                            administrative inexperience and ineptness are now generally perceived,
                            and that its continuing preoccupation with vigorous security measures,
                            however necessary in its own view, is proving detrimental to
                            constructive programs and to public support. Public opinion is also
                            influenced by current economic downturn (not wholly or perhaps even
                            largely ascribable to Junta policies, though general malaise is a
                            factor), and by expressions of hopes (by lower-ranking Junta members) or
                            of fears (by opponents) that present “national government” will cling to
                            power indefinitely. To extent any or all these trends may strengthen in
                            coming months, strains will also mount.</p>
                        <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0790"/>
                        <p>2. In these circumstances we sense <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> may
                            not yet see his future course clearly, while facing challenges by Junta
                            “hard-liners” that he is not being sufficiently firm and revolutionary.
                            Their spokesmen frankly press for long-term authoritarianism and no
                            nonsense about return to traditional politics. Outside government and
                            army we detect little strong enthusiasm for this military-based regime,
                            though number of big businessmen continue in vanguard of its support. We
                            hear considerable though still disorganized and quietly voiced
                            opposition, none of which it should be noted surfaced during November
                            Cyprus crisis or King's countercoup. Most widespread reaction, however,
                            seems still to be acquiescence by people who are either apathetic, or
                            want to keep their heads down or, for lack of better solution and out of
                            distaste for conditions before last April, are prepared to give regime
                            more time to make discernible progress. Predictably, many Greeks seem to
                            feel that in end Uncle Sam can be counted on to take lead in efforts to
                            oust Junta.</p>
                        <p>3. At present our Greek contacts perceive no realistic alternative to
                            present regime. Nor do we. Certainly neither King nor Caramanlis,
                            Papandreous, or any other former political leader now commands assets
                            necessary to re-establish leadership. Nor, so far as we can tell, are
                            people now in mood to generate new civil war. While another military
                            coup is conceivable either through split in present Junta or by group
                            outside it, we have no evidence that a successful move of this kind is
                            in offing; and another abortive attempt would have adverse effect of
                            playing into hands of Junta hard-liners, whose reaction would be
                            recourse to further authoritarianism and stricter security controls over
                            populace.</p>
                        <p>4. It follows that I, for one, view with extreme skepticism risky thesis
                            explicit in Andreas Papandreou's position that if all US support were
                            withdrawn and regime ostracized it would “collapse of its own weight.”
                            Were we to act on basis of such an assumption I fear reaction, on
                            contrary, would be one of intransigence, inverted nationalism and
                            ascendancy of radical faction in Junta which would result in increased
                            authoritarianism, worse image abroad, greater divisiveness of Greek
                            issue in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and possible jeopardy to
                            our important bilateral military facilities here. Even if, as
                            [garble—contended?] by Junta's opponents, ultimate outcome of such a
                            process would be present regime's downfall, time it would take to
                            produce such a result is unpredictable and process would bring probable
                            danger of civil strife before that corner could be turned. These
                            considerations argue strongly in my mind against adoption of such a
                            policy, especially at this stage when we do not yet know how far it may
                            prove possible to push regime toward a return to more democratic ways or
                            to enmesh it sufficiently in process so it will be unable to retain
                            present degree of authoritarian control.</p>
                        <p>5. We face possibility that Junta under influence of hard-liners may in
                            fact be pursuing constitutional process fraudulently and with design <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0791"/>mainly of misleading US and
                            international opinion and masking underlying aim of prolonging its
                            exclusive hold on power. I see no way at present to guarantee against
                            this possibility, which is what politicians fear. However, waiting for
                            elimination of any chance of it before we make any responsive gesture to
                            constitutional steps already taken would in my opinion be course most
                            likely to bring result we least desire. Specifically, with reference to
                            points raised in para 4 of reftel, continued frustration of regime over
                            US failure to lift any of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            restrictions could, in our estimate, have following adverse
                            consequences: (1) strengthen hand of radical elements in Junta and thus
                            slow down return to constitutionalism and reinforce authoritarian
                            tendencies; (2) stimulate nascent <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            inclinations to look elsewhere—France, for instance—for military
                            equipment, with attendant disruption of standardization criteria and
                            probable prejudice to military efficiency and pro-American orientation
                            of Greek armed forces, and (3) lead <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>
                            to re-examine extensive military and <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            facilities rights it grants US (and continued to extend in highly
                            cooperative fashion, it should be recalled, during 1967 ME crisis) and
                            possibly to curtail those rights.</p>
                        <p>6. On other hand, adoption of even an imperfect constitution (comparable,
                            perhaps, to Turkish Constitution of 1961) would be more likely to
                            initiate process of return to greater measure of representative rule.
                            Once a Constitution—indeed almost any Constitution not patently
                            unacceptable—is adopted by plebiscite, I believe external and internal
                            pressures are likely to build up on regime to permit its entry into
                            force in reasonable period (12 to 18 months at the outside). If
                            September constitutional draft should contain provision postponing
                            application for two or more years while regime continued pursue
                            unrealistic or unacceptable revolutionary goals, government would run
                            risk of its rejection. We would in any case be afforded a further
                            legitimate opportunity to put pressure on regime to get on faster with
                            important business of return to constitutionalism.</p>
                        <p>7. As to what new advice and guidance we might give, I am not as sanguine
                            as <persName corresp="#p_Iakovos1">Iakovos</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_PT2">Pappas</persName> that Revolutionary Committee as

                            though <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> might consider suggestions
                            within limits. In next few months country's course will be importantly
                            shaped by progress or failure along road to constitutionalism, economic
                            betterment, and relations with Turkey. In my view most pressing problems
                            for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> now are (A) how to attract
                            broader and higher range of skills to improve governmental performance
                            and thus give flexibility and success image which are prerequisites for
                            a transition to parliamentary rule; and (B) a political plan to find <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0792"/>the exit gate from present
                            narrowly-based governmental structure. New Constitution will presumably
                            provide formalities of transition but, realistically, substance of
                            transition is likely to be accomplished only when Junta has fixed upon
                            its own future course from among several current possibilities. It could
                            establish its own political organization with intention of contesting
                            and presumably winning first elections, find strong civilian front man
                            or group from behind which it could continue for some time to exercise
                            real power (as happened in Turkey after 1961), or seek some other
                            resolution of its obsessive determination not to turn country back to
                            “same old corrupt politicians” who ran it before 1967. To extent we can
                            contribute wisdom in solving these real issues of present regime, our
                            advice could be welcomed.</p>
                        <p>8. I sense that most leading Greek politicians have concluded they cannot
                            afford to jeopardize their own future prospects by collaborating with
                            present rulers. At least some realists among them, however, also hope
                            Junta can be pressed by others to put forward for adoption a
                            Constitution under which political life can be reactivated. To put it
                            bluntly, they don't want to dirty their own hands by dealing with Junta
                            but expect us to do whatever necessary to get show back on road. In past
                            week such personalities as <persName corresp="#p_PP1">Papaligouras</persName> and Mavros have virtually admitted this to
                            me even though they would not say so publicly. On other hand, the only
                            political figures so far willing to help in this effort are asking
                            extremely stiff price of Junta. <persName corresp="#p_MS1">Markezinis</persName> and Tsouderos, for example, have indicated
                            willingness to join present government on condition they be given
                            complete control of economic policy. <persName>Papadopoulos</persName>
                            has not bought these terms. In these circumstances we have little choice
                            but to follow policies dictated essentially by our own conception of
                            what would be best for Greece and our own interests.</p>
                        <p>9. On this question essential ingredients, as General <persName corresp="#p_BLGD1">Burchinal</persName> has put them, are solid and
                            determined <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> membership on eastern
                            flank and comparatively unrestricted availability of bases and
                            facilities in support of US unilateral requirements in Eastern
                            Mediterranean. These goals include further progress on encouraging
                            beginning <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has made in improving
                            bilateral relations with Turkey and moving toward resolutions of Cyprus
                            problem. Moreover, it is essential to pull Greece along to political
                            posture with which other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries
                            can live. We have even more basic interest in attempting to prevent
                            breakdown of Greek polity with all adverse consequences that would
                            follow.</p>
                        <p>10. As I have suggested, in my view this means we must deal with present
                            regime, supporting and focusing on its relatively responsible elements,
                            and give it encouragement and not just lectures to get back on
                            constitutional track. Therefore, I believe it is important for <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to make concrete move in acknowledgment
                            of progress to date in constitutional process. First part of two-fold
                            action should be to begin unfreezing <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss>
                            <pb n="755" xml:id="pg_755" facs="0793"/>suspension lists, starting with
                            clearly defensive and training items, and to resume carefully time
                            phased delivery <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items. Current
                            Soviet buildup in Mediterranean makes minesweeper natural initial
                            candidate for early delivery. This could be justified on basis <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> requirement without increasing
                            regime's capability in internal security. Training and transport planes
                            would also have high priority. Then in June and September other items
                            could be released. Presumably such lead time would be required under
                            normal circumstances to deliver suspended items. By end CY 68, if all
                            goes well, I would hope we could be past outdated posture of using
                            selected restraints on <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> deliveries as
                            tactic to achieve long-range political purposes. If things go badly,
                            deliveries could again be interrupted.</p>
                        <p>11. Having taken this initial step, the second action which should be
                            almost simultaneous would be to initiate discussion on FY 68 <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> and this year's 5-year planning
                            exercise based on mix of grant aid and cash and credit sales. In
                            discussing FY 68 program with <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, we
                            could make certain assumptions on lifting of all suspended items in
                            current program. My advisors tell me very little time remains to meet
                            current year deadlines. I believe it is therefore essential that we move
                            promptly on this second action.</p>
                        <p>12. In my judgment course outlined above, while it does not guarantee
                            success, represents most promising policy line available to <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> for constructively influencing Greek
                            situation in its present parlous condition. On basis recommended
                            decisions USG and Embassy could safely lean harder on <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> than if we abstain from gestures
                            responding to constitutional steps already taken.<note n="4" xml:id="d365fn4">In a March 29 letter thanking <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> for this analysis, <persName corresp="#p_BHD1">Brewster</persName> reported that the question

                            of certain selected military items would be most helpful. He then
                            sketched in recent developments in Greece including the government's
                            action remitting agricultural debts, noting that the regime was
                            obviously trying to curry favor with the farmer. It is conceivable that
                            the Greek Government might be looking to a Peron-type situation basing
                            itself on farm-labor support. He also noted that American Church-World
                            Service representatives, who had been working with this Greek Government
                            and previous ones considered this one, in fact, quite efficient. They
                            also believed the Greek in the countryside was fairly well satisfied
                            with his present lot.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> asked whether the
                            business community and the “establishment” was not being affected by the
                            Greek Government's rather spasmodic actions, particularly in the
                            economic field. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>
                            replied affirmatively stating that the businessman is maintaining a
                            “wait and see” stance and is annoyed with some of the government's more
                            stupid actions. Even though the economy is in a “slow-down period”, the
                            government has moved effectively to collect taxes and direct tax
                            receipts have been stepped up by 47% as against a year ago.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked what pressures there were internally on the
                            Greek Government to return to political normalcy. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> replied no effective
                            pressures—basically those at work came from the outside world. He and
                            the British Ambassador were the only two <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> representatives in Greece who were really pressing the
                            Greek Government in the direction of Constitutionalism.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> asked whether the
                            proposed release of the military items listed in the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> paper would make the Greek Government
                            think that it could get away with less forward motion toward
                            normalization. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>
                            replied “no”. In his view they had not as yet settled in their own minds
                            on the Constitutional question and the next two months were all
                            important. It was during this time that our influence would be most
                            meaningful, that is, while they were shaping their Constitutional
                            thoughts. The Greek regime recognizes that it needs the West but at the
                            same time is examining alternatives. It could also tighten up on the
                            many privileges which the United States enjoys as, for example, the
                            rights of overflight without advance clearance. The Government could
                            generally take on a posture more like the present Turkish stance.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary said the problem he sees in the Greek situation is
                            that the Greek regime is not interested in making genuine progress
                            toward Constitutionalism. They may be prepared to say they are taking
                            actions for the purpose of a facade, but we want to make sure that it is
                            their facade not ours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName>, returning to the
                            question of the timing of the release of certain selected <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items, asked whether the best timing
                            would be between now and June or between June and September. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> said definitely
                            between now and June.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> then spoke of
                            two contingencies which (although considered remote by his colleagues)
                            might call for a rapid decision as to a United States posture.</p>
                        <p>1. A take-over by the junior military.</p>
                        <p>2. A countercoup by senior military with possible participation of former
                            politicians. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>
                            could foresee a situation where we would be called upon for help.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> responded by saying
                            that we would have to look at the situation at the time, analyzing the
                            composition of the group which was supporting the coup and those who
                            were carrying it out, we would need to weigh carefully its chances of
                            success, and its general acceptability to the Greek people. It was not
                            possible to make any advance commitment.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> then described
                            briefly three groups which might attempt to join forces to achieve a
                            transitional changeover.</p>
                        <p>1. <persName corresp="#p_Karamanlis1">Karamanlis</persName>, former Prime
                            Minister, plus <gloss target="#t_ERE1">ERE</gloss> elements, the
                            “apostate group” led by <persName corresp="#p_SS1">Stephanopoulos</persName>, and moderate Center Union elements.</p>
                        <p>2. Another group might include certain non-political “establishment”
                            types, such as Professor <persName corresp="#p_ZZ1">Zolotas</persName>,
                            former head of the Bank of Greece, Lambrakis, newspaper owner, and a
                            variety of younger men including some former politicians.</p>
                        <p>3. A left-of-center group including from <persName corresp="#p_PA2">Andreas Papandreou</persName> to the far left. None of these groups
                            are very far along with any planning or coordination of their
                            efforts.</p>
                        <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0796"/>
                        <p>In response to questions as to whether a release of selected <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items would deflect anti-junta planning
                            by any of the political leaders, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> thought it would not since the men recognized
                            that the resumption of the shipment of selected <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items was designed by the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> to press the Greek regime back to
                            Constitutionalism.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary asked why Greek political figures (George Papandreou
                            and Kanellopoulos) were boycotting the Greek regime's efforts to draw up
                            a new Constitution. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> replied that this stance on their part grew out
                            of the fact that they as politicians could not afford to be associated
                            in any way with the Greek regime's actions.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> raised
                            the question of how active he should be in prodding the Greek
                            Government. The Under Secretary responded that we should continue to
                            push them privately and quietly, but not publicly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLD1">Battle</persName> pointed out that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> could use the same
                            theme he had used with the Greek Ambassador, namely that reestablishment
                            of the traditional warmth in US-Greek relations would depend on the
                            return to normal democratic processes.</p>
                        <p>In a second session at 6:30 p.m. April 22 (with all participants present
                            except Mr. Sober) the question was raised by Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName> as to the value we placed on
                            Greece for the special facilities it offered. He also asked whether it
                            was likely that we would be placing increased demands on the Greek
                            regime for facilities as a result of any possible Turkish phasing-out of
                            military installations. It was stated that on the basis of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_HPT1">Hart</persName>'s assessment concerning
                            facilities in Turkey there would be no call at present to absorb further
                            DOD requirements in Greece. In this connection the Under Secretary
                            requested that a memorandum be drafted to the Defense Department asking
                            how valuable and irreplaceable the present DOD installations were in
                            Greece.</p>
                        <p>There followed a general discussion on the contribution made by the Greek
                            regime to a settlement of the Cyprus problem last fall and to an
                            improvement in Greek-Turk relations.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of future <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> the Under
                            Secretary noted the problems involved in anticipating the levels of 1969
                                <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> on a worldwide basis and
                            determining what portion of the Military Assistance Program specifically
                            be allocated to Greece. He thought Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TPH1">Talbot</persName>, on returning to Athens, should
                            give the Greek regime a rather frank assessment of the mood in the
                            United States. He should urge them to continue on the road back to
                            political normalcy but not to the point where it would bring about a
                            major crisis.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the house arrest of the two former Prime Ministers<note n="3" xml:id="d366fn3">On April 15, Kanellopoulos and Papandreou were
                                arrested for “excessive” political activity.</note> and the fact
                            that forward motion on the release of selected <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> items in <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0797"/>accord with the <gloss target="#t_SIG1">SIG</gloss> decision was
                            related to lifting this restriction, the Under Secretary stated that
                            without instructing the Greek regime to release these two men, the
                            Ambassador could describe the domestic problem created for us, both in
                            Congress and with public opinion, by their continued detention.</p>

                        <p>4. We see much to be gained by telling GOT officially of our interest in
                            and views on current developments in Cyprus dispute and specifically our
                            belief that time is ripe for positive reciprocal action by Turks-Turk
                            Cypriots. <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> has little
                            room left for unilateral compromises. In Saturday speech he struck
                            pessimistic tone by commenting that prospects for talks not bright and
                            that, although door for talks open as far as Greek side concerned,
                            “frequent recent Turkish statements do not permit great margins of
                            optimism.” In addition, hints are beginning to creep into Greek Cypriot
                            press that because of Turk intransigence perhaps best policy for GOC is
                            return to confrontation with Greece's help.</p>
                        <p>5. To regain momentum lost in past ten days we believe reciprocal move by
                            Turks in areas of normalization, as well as willingness by both sides to
                            compromise on venue seem necessary.<note n="7" xml:id="d367fn7">Representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities met on

                        <p>1. In light of <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>' comments
                            on <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> economic aid to Turkish Cypriots
                            (reftel), it seems evident that initiation of aid program which GOT
                            reportedly now considering could, if not handled carefully, have effect
                            comparable to that produced by last December's sudden announcement of
                            Turkish Cypriot Provisional Administration.</p>
                        <p>2. Believe would be wise precaution if Embassy could find opportunity to
                            note to FonOff need for handling aid issue so as to preserve climate of
                            confidence necessary for success of communal talks. Aware as we are of
                            Greek Cypriot misgivings about objectives of aid, we hope that if <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> decides initiate economic aid program
                            in Turkish Cypriot community it will inform GOC well in advance of
                            public announcement and will make sure that GOC has full and correct
                            understanding of purpose of aid.</p>
                        <p>3. We will seek opportunity make same point with Turkish Embassy after
                            you have approached FonOff.</p>
                        <p>4. If approached on possible US economic aid for Turkish Cypriots,
                            Embassy should offer no encouragement. We have consistently turned down
                            such proposals for several years. Embassy may point out that we no
                            longer give aid to Cyprus; if we did, it would have to be on
                            government-to-government basis; and aid funds are now more severely
                            restricted than ever.<note n="3" xml:id="d368fn3">In telegram 6704 from

                        <p>2175. Subj: Cyprus: local talks and policy planning.</p>
                        <p>1. Month-long break in local talks provides respite from rather frenetic
                            pace of diplomatic activity maintained since last crisis, as well as
                            opportunity for assessment of current situation and potentialities for
                            further progress or new problems. Our starting point is same as it was
                            in our immediate post-crisis analyses. In words of Yost report:<note n="2" xml:id="d369fn2">See <ref target="#d358fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 358</ref>.</note> “… Unless and until long-term
                            settlement (of Cyprus problem) is reached recurrence of … crisis very
                            likely; and … if it recurs, war can probably not be avoided.” Essential
                            validity of this judgment should not be obscured by progress made in
                            solving Cyprus problem since December 1967.</p>
                        <p>2. After four years of immobility punctuated by periodic, bloody crises
                            present 30-day hiatus in local talks permits leaders (and publics) of
                            both communities to digest several new departures of past six months. In
                            our view maneuvering starting in January and extending through first
                            phase of local talks boils down to following:</p>
                        <p>A. For all practical purposes Greek Cypriots have put aside enosis and
                            Turk Cypriots have done likewise with partition. Both sides approaching
                            problem on basis of independent Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>B. In spite of real progress in normalization by Greeks and concessions
                            by Turks in local talks, neither side has seriously compromised basic
                            position designed to achieve equally basic goal. Greeks want power to
                            determine destiny of independent Cyprus commensurate with their
                            numerical and economic power. This they view as best achieved by unitary
                            state responsive through new Constitution to will of majority. Turks
                            want security of life and property which they feel best protected by (a)
                            substantial autonomy in areas presently under their control plus (b)
                            some form of background safeguarding role for <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>. Unilateral normalization measures instituted by GOC,
                            although seemingly compromise, actually reinforced their position
                            because to degree integrity of Turkish enclaves lessened by Turks coming
                            out (or Greeks going in), by economic integration, etc., unitary state
                            strengthened. Only known Greek concession in talks is GOC agreement to
                            pay same per capita amount for education of Turkish children as for
                            Greek. This likewise strengthens unitary concept. By same token
                                <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName> has offered to accept
                            representation based on population (20 percent) for Turks in organs of
                            government and to relinquish <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0801"/>right of veto in tax matters. However, neither concession impinges on
                            concept of local autonomy.</p>
                        <p>C. Both <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName> negotiating in good faith,
                            though each trying to “get the most” for own side, to satisfy respective
                            leaderships, to find a formula that will both work and be acceptable to
                            public opinion of their respective communities. Each shows sympathetic
                            understanding of problems other has with own communal leadership.
                            Nevertheless negative pressures are great and increasing. However,
                            negotiating position of both sides protected by fact that both have made
                            it clear all compromises are contingent upon, indeed dependent upon,
                            construction of “over-all agreement” including external guarantees of
                            some sort.</p>
                        <p>D. UNSYG Special Rep Osorio-Tafall playing active (but still discreet)
                            role by feeding compromise ideas into talks through his contacts with
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>.</p>
                        <p>E. Emphasis on “over-all agreement” has activated link between internal
                            problems bilaterally solved and external problems to be solved by
                            multilateral international accords.</p>
                        <p>3. Problems—We see following problems representing real block to further
                            progress:</p>
                        <p>A. Loss of momentum—Momentum generated by November crisis—which has been
                            a primary factor in bringing us to satisfactory conclusion of first
                            phase of local talks—appears rapidly dissipating. We detect distressing
                            signs of complacency in some Greek quarters. Certain Greek hardliners
                            taking position they can afford to be firm in negotiations because
                            economic and political factors operating in their favor, i.e., economic
                            depression of enclaves and eventual necessity of Turks having to
                            integrate economically with rest of island. (We suspect Makarios
                            espouses this view.) Turk counterparts genuinely fearing erosion
                            relative security they now enjoy argue they should stick to hard
                            position in local talks, defend integrity of enclaves, and build
                            economic and administrative separateness of their areas.</p>
                        <p>B. Constitutional differences—against this background of decreasing
                            positive momentum real differences in substance must be considered. Two
                            sides have arrived at point in local talks where they must begin to
                            bargain on fundamentals if significant progress to continue. In pursuing
                            goal of security Turks want autonomy, i.e., administrative and police
                            control, in areas they now hold exclusively. Greeks in striving for
                            unitary state prefer smaller Turkish administrative units based on towns
                            and villages with less autonomy under centralized control. They
                            emphasize common electoral rolls, elimination of executive veto, have
                            suggested elimination of office of Vice President and other elements
                            designed prevent Turks from obstructing responsiveness of government to
                            will of Greek majority. Disposition of National Guard and TMT and
                            related <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0802"/>question of general
                            disarming of population also obvious major unsolved problems.</p>
                        <p>C. Guarantees—International factor—in addition to problems of
                            restructuring Cyprus state, both <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName> have stated everything dependent on “over-all
                            agreement.” In short, hoped-for new constitutional arrangements will not
                            go into operation until agreement reached on external aspects of
                            problem, namely, for Turk Cypriots, some “adequate” provision for their
                            security and for GOC elimination of <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss>'s claimed right of unilateral intervention.</p>
                        <p>D. Compensation—Agreement on reparations for losses suffered (principally
                            by Turks), and how they will be financed is another knotty unresolved
                            problem area.</p>
                        <p>E. Timing—Finally, question of timing is crucial. Most important
                            dimension concerns position of Denktash in Turk Cypriot community. He is
                            now at height of popularity and influence and is apparently strongly
                            backed by Ankara and <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> Embassy here.
                            Moreover, we feel Denktash has will to compromise, imagination to find
                            ways and means to compromise and courage and position to push
                            compromises with Kuchuk, <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and Turk
                            Cypriot community. However, longer local talks drag on, more subject he
                            is to attack by hawks in own community and more his now practically
                            unchalleneged position will be undermined. Already Turk Cypriot dailies
                            Bozkurt and Zafer are challenging <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName> position by opposing in advance compromises he
                            must make and by questioning usefulness of talks. <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName> has commented to us on
                            opposition to him in <gloss target="#t_TCPA1">TCPA</gloss> and his
                            method so far of dealing with it (Nicosia 2169).<note n="3" xml:id="d369fn3">Dated August 1. (Department of State, Central
                                Files, POL 15–1 CYP)</note> Turkish Embassy (Nicosia 2142)<note n="4" xml:id="d369fn4">Dated July 26. (Ibid., POL 27 CYP)</note> has
                            also expressed concern about time element in connection with <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName>'s leadership role. Other
                            aspects of timing problem involve internal situations in Greece and
                            Turkey. In former case, regardless of views about colonels' regime,
                            appears to us here reintroduction parliamentary regime would in all
                            probability mean Cyprus would become political football it formerly was.
                            Basically, <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> is—at least for time
                            being—out of Cyprus equation. Old-line politicians, if they return to
                            power, might well bring Greece back into it. In case of Turkey federal
                            elections are scheduled for 1969. It would seem almost inevitable that
                            opposition will use Cyprus to berate present government if matter still
                            unsettled when elections occur.</p>
                        <p>4. Recommendations—Given our analysis of problems remaining in current
                            situation, potential which exists for failure of local talks, probably
                            followed by swift deterioration of Cyprus problem, and limited time
                            available to promote successful outcome of promising developments <pb n="765" xml:id="pg_765" facs="0803"/>to date, we raise following
                            policy recommendations for consideration by Department and interested
                            colleagues:</p>
                        <p>A. That Embassy Nicosia emphasize to GOC contacts at all levels our view
                            that normalization by Turk Cypriots, disposition of Turkish contingent
                            (see NKI 170 and 173),<note n="5" xml:id="d369fn5">Not found.</note> and
                            questions of guarantees are all linked to concessions by GOC on degree
                            of autonomy Turk Cypriots will be given in restructured Cyprus state. As
                            stressed by <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName>, the greater
                            the degree of autonomy achieved by Turk Cypriots, more concessions they
                            will make on normalization and guarantees.</p>
                        <p>B. That <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> as appropriate encourage
                            maintenance of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> and GOC–<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> contacts on external aspects of Cyprus problem which so
                            closely linked to internal problems. Progress on external problems such
                            as contingents and guarantees could lead to progress in local talks as
                            well as vice versa.</p>
                        <p>C. That <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> join with Brits in effort to
                            use December mandate renewal to maintain pressure on GOC and Turk
                                Cypriots-<gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> to compromise, e.g., by
                            limiting mandate renewal to 3 months and joining other contributors in
                            supporting further troop reductions (Osorio currently favors three-month
                            renewal and further 25 percent troop reduction).</p>
                        <p>D. That Embassy Nicosia join at an appropriate time (probably sometime in
                            second phase of talks this fall) with Osorio-Tafall in pushing for
                            demilitarization, e.g., further deconfrontation and rundown of troop
                            strength of National Guard and TMT.<note n="6" xml:id="d369fn6">In

                                at a press conference announcing the release of a new draft
                                Constitution. (Ibid.)</note>
                        </p>

                        <p>1. Embassy believes draft constitutional revisions announced Sept 16 are
                            less important substantively than in their confirmation of emerging
                            harder line of regime policies. Prime example is revision of Article
                            138. Earlier imprecise wording had given regime ample scope to control
                            pace of return to full constitutionality. New formula, by specifying key
                            articles that will not come into effect until government so decides,
                            confronts Greek voters with Hobson's choice. Rejection of Constitution
                            would put aside any early hope of getting constitutional rule. On other
                            hand, acceptance of this Constitution now will mean explicitly approving
                            regime as sole arbiter of dates when Greeks can once more have
                            constitutionally-protected civil rights, political parties and
                            elections. In other words, regime can claim affirmative plebiscite
                            result (which we believe to be virtually certain) as public mandate to
                            continue government in present authoritarian form under state of siege
                            as long as government itself believes this necessary.</p>
                        <p>2. As expected, many people here see revised draft, plus Prime Minister's
                            explanatory remarks, as further strong evidence of military regime's
                            unwillingness to relinquish power for indefinite period and that as a
                            consequence constitutional referendum will be meaningless.</p>
                        <p>3. Realistically, any prospect of forward movement after plebiscite
                            depends mainly on appraisal by <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> and his
                            colleagues that this is least disadvantageous course open to them. Their
                            weak and divided opponents will not soon persuade them that it is. Nor
                            in Embassy's judgment will continuation of <gloss target="#t_MAP1">MAP</gloss> suspensions (which in fact will have consequences
                            increasingly adverse to our interests). However, Embassy sees no reason
                            to let regime believe we would regard favorable plebiscite result as
                            genuinely meaningful step in itself unless accompanied by some concrete
                            moves toward restoration of civil liberties and in direction of ultimate
                            elections. We therefore believe it would be desirable to make these
                            points clear to regime leaders in order to avoid any false expectations.
                            Moreover, we would see some advantage if Department press spokesman in
                            response to question about American views on final draft of Constitution
                            should [garble] along lines that we continue to wish for Greece what we
                            believe majority of Greek people sincerely desire—prompt restoration of
                            their civil liberties and early return to representative government.
                            Although such a statement would not be popular with regime it would
                            advertise our continued adherence to goals we have supported since April

                        <p>Attached is Nick Katzenbach's recommendation<note n="2" xml:id="d371fn2">Not printed.</note> that you release about 40% of the equipment
                            we've held in suspense since the April 1967 coup. Most of the items to
                            be released would be replacement items for the air force and navy,
                            though there would be some tank ammo and heavy guns. We would continue
                            to hold the tanks and new F–5 aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The main argument is that the time has come to separate our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> relationship from our disapproval of
                            domestic Greek politics. The colonels have had their constitutional
                            referendum, but they won't hold elections under it until they're ready.
                            We can keep prodding them, but we can't make them. Meanwhile, it doesn't
                            make sense to let our security relationships with Greece—<gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> role, commo facilities, Sixth Fleet
                            support—deteriorate further.</p>
                        <p>A vocal group on the Hill will object to any resumption. You have already
                            had letters from Congressmen <persName corresp="#p_ED1">Edwards</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_Fraser1">Fraser</persName>, who are active with Melina Mercouri and other
                            friends of Greek democracy. But if you approve, Nick plans to consult
                            with key members—before telling the Greeks but after the foreign aid
                            appropriation—and lay it on the line that we can't let our interests
                            suffer further. He feels now is the time to face these people with the
                            facts of the problem and tell them we have to move. He would like to do
                            this before they go home.</p>
                        <p>The rationale for releasing only 40% is to keep some pressure on the
                            colonels and to put ourselves on a more reasonable policy footing while
                            leaving your successor room to move either way. I believe Nick is right
                            that we've about run our course on the suspension. The question is
                            whether you want to begin correcting course yourself.</p>

                            result Athens-Nicosia tensions and domestic political repercussions,
                            delays seem inevitable.</p>
                        <p>1. It is, of course, too early to predict with complete accuracy many
                            internal and external ramifications of Georkadjis affair. Our
                            preliminary analysis, however, indicates general lines of impact of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> problem in three
                            aspects of political situation on island.</p>
                        <p>2. Athens-Nicosia relations—relations between GOC and <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> appear to have been affected on various
                            levels. First, in terms of official government-to-government relations
                            colonels' hand seems to be strengthened by obvious demonstration they
                            can force Makarios to take action he supposedly reluctant to take.
                            (Degree to which <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>
                            “reluctant” to fire <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> is
                            moot since His Beatitude may well have been looking for opportunity to
                            dump increasingly powerful Interior Minister.) In any case, <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> outwardly seems to have
                            knuckled under to <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> demands for
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>' scalp and this has
                            disappointed many Greek Cypriots. Second, by forcing <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to accept <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>' resignation <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> has further angered those politically
                            powerful Greek Cypriot elements (i.e., city lawyer-politicians) who
                            resent <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> meddling in GOC affairs, who
                            are not pro-enosis and who are in favor of accommodation with Turk
                            Cypriots (<persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and Demetriades
                            to name two), although they at least equally angry with Archbishop. On
                            third <pb n="769" xml:id="pg_769" facs="0807"/>level, however,
                            Greek-Cypriot relations hardly disturbed at all. Great mass of villagers
                            (as proved to Ambassador Alexandrakis' satisfaction during recent
                            village visit) still regard “Mother Greece” as “Motherly Fatherland,”
                            welcome and support GOG presence on Cyprus, and regard <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> as “Ethnarch” or leader of
                            Greek nation in Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>3. Entire purpose of <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> in exposing
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> and pressuring for
                            his resignation may well have been to demonstrate to Archbishop
                            (November 6 press carries stories stating that Archbishop ordered
                            issuance of passport to Panagoulis) that there is point beyond which
                            Junta will not tolerate His Beatitude's flirtation with left. According
                            to some reports <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> will demand and get
                            closer cooperation of Cypriot intelligence services (other reports
                            including word from <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>
                            indicate Archbishop will pull intelligence function out of Interior
                            Ministry and place it under his own direct control as part of apparatus
                            of Presidential Palace).</p>
                        <p>4. <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss> seems be proceeding from one
                            precipitate action to next in <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>/Panagoulis affair without thinking through
                            implications. Initial demand for <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>' resignation was achieved but only because
                            Archbishop promised <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>
                            parliamentary elections before January as price for his final agreement
                            to resign. Now faced with prospect of triumphant election of former
                            MinInt to House, which would be real slap in face for <gloss target="#t_GOG1">GOG</gloss>, they now exerting great pressure on
                                <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to go back on
                            promise to <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> and
                            according <gloss target="#t_CAS1">CAS</gloss> info he has agreed to do
                            so. We wonder if they have considered what implications this might have:
                            i.e. mischief-making, not excluding violence from <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> and supporters; more
                            embarrassing leaks to press; and angry reaction from House members and
                            others who now savouring election prospect. At moment Greek Ambassador
                            thinks he has Archbishop's agreement to postponement of elections, but
                            this may well be so only until His Beatitude next talks with <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and other House leaders.</p>
                        <p>5. Domestic political situation—As mentioned above part of deal for
                                <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>' final resignation
                            was undertaking by <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> to
                            hold parliamentary elections by end of January. <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> informed various former
                            EOKA-fighter groups who were demonstrating for <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> of Archbishop's agreement to
                            hold elections. It now appears that <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> who has long called for formation of
                            anti-Communist political party will organize his own party based on
                            fighter groups with help and support (privately if not openly) of
                            Clerides. Other members of House who support <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> (floor leader Demetriades and Chamber of
                            Commerce President Savvides) likewise favor early elections and probably
                            would join <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> coalition. Believe <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> would remain in background in
                            order avoid any open clash with <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName>. He told <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0808"/>Ambassador (memcon pouched)<note n="3" xml:id="d372fn3">In airgram A–371, November 11. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                POL 15 CYP)</note> he considered role as negotiator in communal
                            talks paramount and overruling any personal feelings re election. He
                            would need all his influence with Archbishop for such time as talks
                            require serious compromises. He would not jeopardize his chances of
                            making contribution to solution merely to satisfy his own strong belief
                            that elections necessary and party organization required.</p>
                        <p>6. We expect that Archbishop is reluctant to hold elections and prefers
                            to stall. Among other things postponement of elections would probably
                            cause erosion of <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName>'
                            strength. Strong demand from Greek Embassy that <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> prevent elections which would
                            certainly install <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> in
                            House supports <persName corresp="#p_MIII1">Makarios</persName> in own
                            predilection to avoid or stall elections. Trouble is that <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> and fighter groups believe they have
                            commitment for holding of these elections. <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> and his friends, and many Deputies who
                            support <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> will probably
                            maintain pressure on Archbishop to hold elections. <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> and Demetriades have even
                            spoken to us of possibility of mass resignation of present members of
                            House which would presumably force elections. (We doubt they would go to
                            such extremes; no one voluntarily resigns in Cyprus.) In any case,
                            tug-of-war between political leaders who would like to form parties and
                            contest House elections and Archbishop who prefers House made up of
                            political personalities without political party and dependent on him can
                            be expected. If holding of elections becomes inevitable we anticipate
                            His Beatitude will attempt to balance off various political factions
                            (organized as parties) by urging all parties to unite in support of him
                            and to agree on allocation of seats before elections. In short, net
                            result of <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> affair in
                            domestic political arena will probably be to make political life much
                            more “political.”</p>
                        <p>7. Local talks—As we have previously reported both GOC and Turk Cypriots
                            have gone out of their way to immunize <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> affair from adverse impact on local talks
                            (Nicosia 2638).<note n="4" xml:id="d372fn4">Dated November 7. (Ibid.,
                                POL 27 CYP)</note> However, holding of elections is bound to
                            complicate local talks even if there is prior <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName>
                            agreement. In first place, Greeks will only get Turk Cypriot agreement
                            to holding of elections under 1960 Constitution which compromises Greek
                            position on 1965 electoral law. In second place, Turks will hold their
                            own elections (they would like to clean house as well) but question then
                            arises will new Turk legislators start passing legislation for Turk
                            Cypriot areas. Finally, any election campaign on Greek side risks
                            resurrection of old nationalist war cry of “enosis and only enosis.”</p>
                        <p>8. <persName corresp="#p_GP2">Georkadjis</persName> affair further
                            complicates local talks because internal GOC crisis prevents <persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName> from obtaining any clear
                            guidance from Archbishop and Council of Ministers. Given fight shaping
                            up over elections <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0809"/>and
                            possibility of new Council of Ministers if elections are held, further
                            postponement of real progress in local talks seems likely. More and more
                            concept of “third phase” of local talks (which would begin in January or
                            later) appearing in press and conversation. As previously reported
                            “third phase” seems to be quite acceptable to <gloss target="#t_GOT1">GOT</gloss> Embassy here.</p>
                        <p>9. Needless to say, typically Byzantine political maneuvering in wake of
                            Georkadjis affair is rife and some surprises may yet be in
                            store—particularly since Panagoulis trial is not yet ended. Our regret
                            is that villain of the piece, Archbishop's pro-Communist advisor, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LV1">Vassos Lyssarides</persName>, at whose
                            behest GOC apparently became involved with Panagoulis in first place, so
                            far emerging unscathed.</p>

                            Talks.</p>
                        <p>1. Dept's discussions with reps <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> FonOff
                            and Canadian ExtAff held Nov 14 under chairmanship Dep Asst Sec
                                <persName corresp="#p_RSW1">Rockwell</persName>. Meeting produced
                            striking similarity of views among three governments.</p>
                        <p>2. Following are conclusions reached on major points discussed:</p>
                        <p>a. Normalization and Pacification: all agree that progress in this field
                            seems to have approached its limit with regard to major official moves,
                            but that continuing minor steps taken in <persName corresp="#p_DR1">Denktash</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_CG2">Clerides</persName>
                            forum and at local levels are encouraging and useful in improving
                            atmosphere especially in eastern and central parts of the island. All
                            agreed on continued need for such steps as well as for deconfrontation
                            in such areas as Artemis Road.</p>
                        <p>b. Local Talks: Canadians and British pessimistic over prospects for
                            local talks in view lack of progress in the second phase. We expressed
                                <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0810"/>view it is now too early to
                            be either optimistic or pessimistic pending clear evidence of
                            willingness of parties to compromise or similar evidence of obduracy.
                            All expressed concern at lack of results so far but for moment see no
                            need for outside intervention in talks. All would wish consult urgently
                            with one another if talks in danger of collapse.</p>
                        <p>c. Relative Importance Normalization and Constitutional Talks: All agreed

                        <p>The King began by saying he welcomed the opportunity to discuss once more
                            “the relations between our two countries.” The constitution is a new
                            development, and the question is where we go from here—what steps should
                            be taken to encourage a return to “the right kind of system.” He
                            wondered what ideas The Secretary had as to how to promote the <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0811"/>return to at least the form of
                            representative government as soon as possible. The King said he thought
                            it would be impossible to go from the present system immediately to
                            democratic government. This must be done gradually, but the process must
                            be started soon. He would welcome The Secretary's ideas as to how to get
                            the constitution into effect as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that although the United States has a great interest
                            in this, he was not sure we had any recommendations as to how this
                            should be done. He asked the Foreign Minister what plans existed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> replied that he had
                            been in the hospital and unable to talk with the Prime Minister
                            recently, but the latter clearly had the aim of reaching full
                            implementation of the constitution by gradual and well-considered steps.
                            Naturally there would be many, and the Finance Minister, who had
                            attended the Cabinet meeting concerned, reported that the first very
                            wise step has been taken in the appointment of a committee to draft the
                            laws necessary to implement the constitution—a press law, a political
                            parties law, a constitutional tribunal law, etc. After examination by
                            the Cabinet, the laws will be put into effect at once, parties must be
                            set up, and elections prepared. In his personal opinion, the Foreign
                            Minister said, the most urgent matter now is the return of His Majesty,
                            “not on formal grounds, but for political and psychological grounds.”
                            His presence would lend a new element of stability and enable His
                            Majesty to exercise very important influence, which is essential. He
                            expressed his personal conviction that the Prime Minister agreed with
                            this idea completely, but that he had differences to contend with. No
                            one influence is entirely predominant.</p>
                        <p>Here the King interjected, “Unfortunately!”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> agreed and added that
                            the Prime Minister's group, both inside the Government and without, is
                            becoming predominant but is not entirely so yet. The Foreign Minister
                            said he tried to find a way out. He supported the Prime Minister
                            completely and is convinced the King's return will be advantageous to
                            all. “Your advice,” he said, “and your country's would be invaluable.”
                            “A formal démarche,” he continued, “could do more harm than good, but
                            you have a series of means to make your views known.”</p>
                        <p>In response to The Secretary's question as to whether the differences he
                            had mentioned were within the Cabinet or without, the Foreign Minister
                            said “both”, and the King said “mainly without.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said he knew how much
                            importance the people—the revolutionary committee, and the people in
                            general, attach to the opinion of the United States Government. He knew
                            the United States had many official and unofficial contacts.</p>
                        <p>“You are aware,” the King said, “of my planned meeting last May with the
                            Prime Minister. Due to one thing and another, this has been postponed.
                                <pb n="774" xml:id="pg_774" facs="0812"/>It is very hard to know
                            what is in his mind. I have told him through various people that it is
                            far better to become master in his own house. I think he can't deal with
                            the young people, who are tough. Immediately upon my return I'll work as
                            hard as possible to get rid of them.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked where it had been contemplated the meeting would be
                            held. The King said near Levkas, with the Prime Minister anchored in one
                            cove and the King in another, with the meeting in between at night.</p>
                        <p>The United States, the King continued, carries great weight, but it's
                            hard to tell how long this will last. It was very encouraging to hear
                            that the drafting committee has been appointed, but the question is
                            whether there will be delays.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said he did not think
                            so. He was very happy that the committee had been appointed without his
                            urging. The Prime Minister clearly intends to put the entire
                            constitution into effect, but he is not alone. He has influence, but he
                            must bargain. We have no alternative, the Foreign Minister said, but
                            normalization through this Government and the return of His Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The King said he agreed, and both he and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>, and perhaps the United States, might exercise
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said he could safely
                            say that with the King in Greece the possibilities would increase. The
                            King initially should do nothing except permit his influence to
                            grow.</p>
                        <p>The King laughingly said he'd play tennis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said the King's
                            influence would grow and become very important. The present Government
                            is there to stay. It can be influenced but not thrown out without
                            strife.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had a few observations to make. During his tenure
                            as Secretary there have been sixty-two coups in the world, none of
                            which, he might say, had been engineered by the <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>. Wherever the United States has had influence, it has
                            always been exerted toward return to constitutionalism. The United
                            States has acquired a certain amount of experience in this area.
                            Frequently there are two stages. First there is a restoration of basic
                            civil rights and fair administration of justice, a removal of the fear
                            of oppression, and this leads to the second stage, which, while not
                            constitutionalism, is not totalitarian in its effect on individuals. An
                            important step in Greece would seem to be the return of basic civil
                            rights to prepare the way for constitutional elections.</p>
                        <p>As to the King's return, The Secretary said, he would be very candid. He
                            could not, as a man of honor, advise the King to return, because to do
                            so would imply assurances, which no one had given The Secretary. He
                            could not make pledges he was unable to fulfill. He would not advise the
                            King either to return, or not to return. The King should know to what he
                                <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0813"/>was returning. The
                            Secretary could not advise the King to return to a trap.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said the purpose was
                            to get advice to the revolutionary committee, not the King, who would
                            have to make his own decisions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked how much reliance the United States could put in
                            assurances from the revolutionary committee concerning the King's
                            return.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName> said it was not
                            intended that the United States get assurances but rather that it give
                            advice.</p>
                        <p>In response to The Secretary's question as to how much influence the
                            United States could exert on the revolutionary committee, the Foreign
                            Minister said, “considerable if properly done.”</p>
                        <p>The King said it would be effective if Americans outside the Embassy
                            “talked directly to the Colonels.”</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said there were also many other channels.</p>
                        <p>The King said he agreed The Secretary should not give him advice. He
                            would make his own decisions. But the United States now has influence on
                            the Colonels which may be lost in a year. Results would come from
                            constant pressure on individual colonels for the return of
                            constitutionalism and the King, because they always have in mind what
                            the United States is thinking.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there was no question but that the United States would
                            be glad to see the return to Greece of constitutional democracy,
                            governmental stability, and progress. This advice, the United States has
                            been giving and will continue to give. But in complete candor, the
                            United States could not get involved in what might turn out to be a
                            doublecross.</p>
                        <p>The King said he did not want his return discussed alone. The real issue
                            is what happens to Greece. “I'm terribly homesick”, he said, “but the
                            important thing is, are the people going to get a better deal. I failed
                            to push this Government out by force. Influence is the only possibility.
                            We must persuade them to do the right thing. Then we must see if it's a
                            trap—if I'm going back only as a puppet. It is very important that we—
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PP2">Pipinelis</persName>, the American
                            Government, and I—press for the earliest possible return to
                            constitutionalism. I have to go back to help the process. I'm absolutely
                            confident of the loyalty of the people, but I'm worried about discipline
                            in the armed forces.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked if there were any possibility of starting with local
                            elections.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said this was the course he favored.</p>
                        <p>The King asked if The Secretary agreed that all should exert pressure on
                            the regime and then see if a trap had been laid.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would review this when he returned to Washington.
                            There was no question but that the United States would be very <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0814"/>glad to see Greece move quickly
                            back to a constitutional system. However, it would not be the first time
                            United States advice had been disregarded.</p>
                        <p>The King said he was “immensely worried about the armed forces.” He was
                            going to tell the armed forces chief that he fully supported his
                            attempts to reinstill discipline. The captains are still ruling the
                            colonels, and the colonels, the generals. There is still dissension
                            between the forces. The armed forces must again earn the respect of the
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The King said he hoped the United States Government and the new
                            Administration would continue to have no dealings with the Regent, whom
                            the King does not recognize.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the King said a determination would have to be made at
                            some point as to whether or not attempts to exert influence on the
                            regime were being successful. Allowing the situation to continue
                            indefinitely would simply help the Communists, because eventually there
                            would be an explosion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this matter would be considered very carefully. He was
                            inclined to agree that conditions could not be frozen, because this
                            would be very dangerous. He hoped very much to see fast movement toward
                            constitutional government and wished the King good luck.</p>
                        <p>The King and The Secretary then had a brief chat alone.<note n="2" xml:id="d374fn2">No record of this conversation has been

                        <p>Dear Dan:</p>
                        <p>My talk with <persName>Papadopoulos</persName> on December 28 was
                            disappointing. So that you could get the full flavor, we decided to
                            airgram Pete Peterson's full memcon rather than reducing it to more
                            readable length.<note n="2" xml:id="d375fn2">Transmitted as an enclosure
                                to airgram A–2 from Athens, January 1, 1969. (Ibid., Central Files,
                                POL GREECE–US)</note> If you can plow through it, you will see that
                            the Prime Minister argued strongly for <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0815"/>military assistance levels to be judged on military
                            grounds alone and virtually rejected my rather lengthy disquisition in
                            support of the proposition that other factors have also to be taken into
                            account even when military considerations are predominant.</p>
                        <p>I found the Prime Minister less forthcoming about his future plans than
                            on any previous occasion. My effort to launch into a discussion of his
                            plans for moderating the state of siege was turned aside by the comment
                            that there was really nothing more to be said beyond his public address
                            of December 14.<note n="3" xml:id="d375fn3">The Embassy analyzed this
                                speech in telegram 8308 from Athens, December 16. (Ibid., POL 15–1
                                GREECE)</note> He was polite but firm in stating that he would be
                            ready to discuss his future plans with me after the holidays if I
                            desired but would regret it if such a discussion were really necessary
                            to assure good relations between Greece and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am not sure how to read this stiffening stance. One explanation is that
                            Papadopoulos feels sufficiently secure in the saddle so that he can be a
                            little more cavalier with us as well as with European countries. Another
                            is that he has decided to get a reading on the new American
                            Administration before defining his 1969 policies on civil liberties and
                            constitutional implementation. If he has decided on a major forward
                            step, he may prefer to hold it until its announcement could be expected
                            to get him off on a good start with the new American Administration.
                            Alternatively, he may have decided not to take any steps now that might
                            prove not to have been necessary should the new Administration be
                            substantially more relaxed than the old one in its attitude toward the
                            Greek regime.</p>
                        <p>My own hunch is that his unforthcomingness resulted from a combination of
                            these factors. It would be natural for him to regard the present
                            American Administration, and its representative in Athens, as lame ducks
                            and to hold off decisive moves until he can get a reading on the new
                                Administration.<note n="4" xml:id="d375fn4">In a December 27 letter
